This algorithm is quite popular within the robotics community for the production of trained neural networks without having to determine a priori their size and topology. The main drawback of the traditional NEAT algorithm is that, even though it can implement recurrent synaptic connections, which allow it to perform some time related processing tasks, its capabilities are rather limited, especially when dealing with precise time dependent phenomena. NEAT’s ability to capture the underlying dynamics that correspond to complex time series still has a lot of room for improvement. To address this issue, the paper describes a new implementation of the NEAT algorithm that is able to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable time delayed synapses in addition to its previous capacities. We show that this approach, called tao-NEAT improves the behavior of the neural networks obtained when dealing with complex time related processes. Several examples are presented, both dealing with the generation of ANNs that are able to produce complex theoretical signals such as chaotic signals or real data series, as in the case of the monthly number of international airline passengers or monthly $$\hbox {CO}_{2}$$CO2 concentrations. In these examples, t-NEAT clearly improves over the traditional NEAT algorithm in these tasks. A final example of the integration of this approach within a robot cognitive mechanism is also presented, showing the clear improvements it could provide in the modeling required for many cognitive processes."

However, the natural reward function for the task is usually sparse, i.e., obtaining a penalty for the collision and a positive reward for arriving the target position, which makes it difficult to learn. In particular, for some complex navigation environments, it is hard to search a collision-free path by the random exploration, which leads to a rather slow learning speed and solutions with poor performance. In this paper, we propose a DRL based approach to train an end-to-end navigation planner, i.e, the policy neural network, that directly translates the local grid map and the relative goal of the robot into its moving actions. To handle the sparse reward problem, we augment the normal extrinsic reward from the environment with intrinsic reward signals measured by random network distillation (RND). In specific, the intrinsic reward is calculated by two different networks from RND, which encourages the agent to explore a state that has not been seen before. The experimental results show that by augmenting the reward function with intrinsic reward signals by RND, solutions with better performance can be learned more efficiently and more stably in our approach. We also deploy the trained model to a real robot, which can perform collision avoidance in navigation tasks without any parameter tuning.

First, a cloud-based mission control architecture that renders easy, timely and prioritized remote access to the USVs regardless of the remote operator’s location is proposed. It is achieved by leveraging remote cloud-based technology and local Operating onboard System. Decentralized property of the architecture accomplishes scalable monitoring, remote control, data acquisition and missions sharing for an USV fleet. Second, the related software interfaces are required for this task: the user interface of the remote client that is used for mission control/planning and data visualization and that is applicable across mobile robotic systems; and the back-end interface for the local USVs that bridges robotic and cloud server and provides seamless integration with the well-established Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS is nowadays, the most widely used framework for robotics developments. Furthermore, the proposed cloud-based mission control architecture is implemented on a fleet of real vehicles, H2Omni-X USVs, and the performance of the remote experimentation is demonstrated during sea trials at the Adriatic coast, Croatia, representing the practical contribution of this paper."

The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) provides data foundation and guarantee for real-time perception and detection of production state. Taking abundant IoT data as support, a density peak (DP)-weighted fuzzy C-means (WFCM) based clustering method is proposed to detect abnormal situations in production process. Firstly, a features correlation and redundancy measure method based on mutual information (MI) and conditional MI is proposed, unsupervised feature reduction is completed based on the principle of maximum correlation-minimum redundancy. Secondly, a DP-WFCM based clustering model is established to identify clusters with fewer samples to detect production anomalies. DP is used to obtain the initial clustering centers to solve the problem that FCM is sensitive to the initial centers and the clusters number needs to be determined manually in advance. MI-based similarities are introduced as weight coefficients to guide the clustering process, which improves convergence speed and clustering quality. Finally, a real case from an IoT enabled machining workshop is carried out to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method in anomaly detection of manufacturing process."

This system has been called MotivEn (Motivational Engine) and we have carried out its initial integration within the Multilevel Darwinist Brain (MDB) cognitive architecture. We describe here the main elements of MotivEn and how they improve the current MDB operation. Moreover, we present in detail a specific implementation of MotivEn and the application results obtained in terms of sub-goal identification when applying it in a real robot experiment with the MDB."

Previous works usually assume that the geometry information of the objects is available, or utilize a step-wise, multi-stage strategy to predict the feasible 6-DoF grasp poses. In this work, we propose to formalize the 6-DoF grasp pose estimation as a simultaneous multi-task learning problem. In a unified framework, we jointly predict the feasible 6-DoF grasp poses, instance semantic segmentation, and collision information. The whole framework is jointly optimized and end-to-end differentiable. Our model is evaluated on large-scale benchmarks as well as the real robot system. On the public dataset, our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+4.08 AP). We also demonstrate the implementation of our model on a real robotic platform and show that the robot can accurately grasp target objects in cluttered scenarios with a high success rate.
