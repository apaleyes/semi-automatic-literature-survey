In particular, we demonstrate a system, called OLAV, which is able, for the first time, to (1) learn to form discrete concepts from sensory data; (2) ground language (n-grams) to these concepts; (3) induce a grammar for the language being used to describe the perceptual world; and moreover to do all this incrementally, without storing all previous data. The learning is achieved in a loosely-supervised manner from raw linguistic and visual data. Moreover, the learnt model is transparent, rather than a black-box model and is thus open to human inspection. The visual data is collected using three different robotic platforms deployed in real-world and simulated environments and equipped with different sensing modalities, while the linguistic data is collected using online crowdsourcing tools and volunteers. The analysis performed on these robots demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in learning visual concepts, language groundings and grammatical structure in these three online settings.",robotics

Our tool simplifies the process of deploying, evaluating, and comparing depth reconstruction neural networks both on real robots and in simulation. We complement our software with a set of the precompiled neural networks which can be used off the shelf, with some of them being able to demonstrate near real-time performance when running onboard compact embedded platforms, e.g. Nvidia Jetson TX2, that are often used nowadays both in academia and industry.",robotics

The unexplainable success of black-box DL models has raised questions among scientists and promoted the emergence of the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In robotics, it is particularly important to deploy DL algorithms in a predictable and stable manner as robots are active agents that need to interact safely with the physical world. This paper presents an analytic deep learning framework for fully connected neural networks, which can be applied for both regression problems and classification problems. Examples for regression and classification problems include online robot control and robot vision. We present two layer-wise learning algorithms such that the convergence of the learning systems can be analyzed. Firstly, an inverse layer-wise learning algorithm for multilayer networks with convergence analysis for each layer is presented to understand the problems of layer-wise deep learning. Secondly, a forward progressive learning algorithm where the deep networks are built progressively by using single hidden layer networks is developed to achieve better accuracy. It is shown that the progressive learning method can be used for fine-tuning of weights from convergence point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated based on classical benchmark recognition tasks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and the results show a good balance between performance and explainability. The proposed method is subsequently applied for online learning of robot kinematics and experimental results on kinematic control of UR5e robot with unknown model are presented.",robotics

In Deep RL, such risk is mostly in the form of adversarial attacks, which introduce small perturbations to sensor inputs with the aim of changing the network-based decisions and thus cause catastrophic situations. In the light of these dangers, a promising line of research is that of providing these Deep RL algorithms with suitable defenses, especially when deploying in real environments. This paper suggests that this line of research could be greatly improved by the concepts from the existing research field of Safe Reinforcement Learning, which has been postulated as a family of RL algorithms capable of providing defenses against many forms of risks. However, the connections between Safe RL and the design of defenses against adversarial attacks in Deep RL remain largely unexplored. This paper seeks to explore precisely some of these connections. In particular, this paper proposes to reuse some of the concepts from existing Safe RL algorithms to create a novel and effective instance-based defense for the deployment stage of Deep RL policies. The proposed algorithm uses a risk function based on how far a state is from the state space known by the agent, that allows identifying and preventing adversarial situations. The success of the proposed defense has been evaluated in 4 Atari games.",robotics
