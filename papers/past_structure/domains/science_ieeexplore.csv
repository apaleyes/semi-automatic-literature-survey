Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that integrates hardware and software. Given its versatility, expressiveness and operability, designers and artists are free to turn their ideas into reality on this platform, using programming languages to create high-quality interactive installations. In response to children's difficulty telling the difference between the five cereals, this paper seeks to educate children on crops in the form of human-computer interaction through the design and manufacture of a popular science-themed interactive device. Through the external hardware configuration (pressure induction, lamp and sound), children are guided to knowing and grasping the growth stages of common plants. In this way, children's perceptions of nature and crops can be constructed through a combination of technology and art.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9389899/,"2021 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Engineering (ICBAIE)",26-28 March 2021,ieeexplore

With the development of global intelligent technology, parents pay more attention to children’s intelligent education, and books combined with science and technology become more popular. As one of the important tools in the process of children’s growth, books play an important role in children’s early education. However, most of the popular science books are still natural universe, animal world, military education and other subjects. Today, with the development of intelligent technology, it has become an inevitable thing to carry out artificial intelligence science popularization for children. Therefore, this article uses multimedia technology, uses Kudan SDK to develop AR applications in Unity, explores the application of AR technology in popular science books, and uses artificial intelligence as the theme for creation. It mainly includes the cognitive analysis of artificial intelligence, ar software system design and the design exploration of AR and books for 7-11 year olds, so that children can understand and learn the relevant knowledge of AI in the technical environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516578/,2021 International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and its Application on Media (ISAIAM),21-23 May 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/BigData.2016.7840859,Building a research data science platform from industrial machines,IEEE,Conferences,"Data Science research has a long history in academia which spans from large-scale data management, to data mining and data analysis using technologies from database management systems (DBMS's). While traditional HPC offers tools on leveraging existing technologies with data processing needs, the large volume of data and the speed of data generation pose significant challenges. Using the Hadoop platform and tools built on top of it drew immense interest from academia after it gained success in industry. Georgia Institute of Technology received a donation of 200 compute nodes from Yahoo. Turning these industrial machines into a research Data Science Platform (DSP) poses unique challenges, such as: nontrivial hardware design decisions, configuration tool choices, node integration into existing HPC infrastructure, partitioning resource to meet different application needs, software stack choices, etc. We have 40 nodes up and running, 24 running as a Hadoop and Spark cluster, 12 running as a HBase and OpenTSDB cluster, the others running as service nodes. We successfully tested it against Spark Machine Learning algorithms using a 88GB image dataset, Spark DataFrame and GraphFrame with a Wikipedia dataset, and Hadoop MapReduce wordcount on a 300GB dataset. The OpenTSDB cluster is for real-time time series data ingestion and storage for sensor data. We are working on bringing up more nodes.

Practices and assessments need specific learning environments where learners could play with data samples and run machine learning and data mining algorithms. To foster learner engagement many closed-and open-source platforms support the design of data science competitions. However, they show limitations on the ability to handle private data, customize the analytics and evaluation processes, and visualize learners' activities and outcomes. This paper presents Data Science Lab Environment (DSLE, in short), a new open-source platform to design and monitor data science competitions. DSLE offers a easily configurable interface to share training and test data, design group works or individual sessions, evaluate the competition runs according to customizable metrics, manage public and private leaderboards, monitor participants' activities and their progress over time.

In the foundry we present a series of software modules that transform the data into different representations. Ultimately, each online learner is represented using a set of variables that capture his/her online behavior. These variables are captured longitudinally over an interval. Using this representation we then build a predictive analytics stack that is able to predict online learners behavior as the course progresses in real time. To demonstrate the efficacy of the foundry, we attempt to solve an important prediction problem for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): who is likely to stopout? Across a multitude of courses, with our complex per-student behavioral variables, we achieve a predictive accuracy of 0.7 AUCROC and higher for a one-week-ahead prediction problem. For a two-to-three-weeks-ahead prediction problem, we are able to achieve 0.6 AUCROC. We validate, via transfer learning, that these predictive models can be used in real time.

At present, research focuses on diseases and insect pests, intelligent irrigation, greenhouse environment-specific crop monitoring, and other individual issues, in which the utilization efficiency of agricultural information technology is low. The purpose of this study is to fully grasp the change in the ecological climate of ASTPs and improve their intelligence level. This study, based on the Internet of Things of agricultural information transmission and control, designs a greenhouse climatic and agricultural science and technology park and unifies the field intelligent control and scientific research and production integration management platforms. Standardized planting and a field monitoring center for large data visualization analysis for scientific research and production are used to achieve real-time online mining analysis, monitoring, and early warning and decision support services. A software terminal is used to prompt on-site management measures and early warning according to weather changes.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921432,From information revolution to intelligence revolution: Big data science vs. intelligence science,IEEE,Conferences,"The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 2<sup>1,000</sup> state space, known as `big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to solve typical everyday problems. Towards these objectives, the latest advances in abstract intelligence and intelligence science investigated in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing are well positioned at the center of intelligence revolution. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC [http://www.ucalgary.ca/icic/] such as, inter alia, cognitive computers, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, cognitive communications systems, and cognitive automobiles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6921432/,2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing,18-20 Aug. 2014,ieeexplore

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach.

Research is needed to build systems that can monitor their environment and interactions, learn their capabilities and limitations, and adapt to meet the mission objectives with limited or no human intervention. The systems should be fail-safe and should allow for graceful degradations while continuing to meet the mission objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of our proposed new methodologies and workflows, and survey the existing approaches and new ones that can advance the science of autonomy in smart systems through enhancements in real-time control, auto-reconfigurability, monitoring, adaptability, and trust.

10.1109/COGINF.2006.365669,On Intelligence Science and Recent Progresses,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only given. Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4216384/,2006 5th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics,17-19 July 2006,ieeexplore

In Computational Science and Engineering (CSE), the complexity of the ML lifecycle comes from the large variety of data, scientists' expertise, tools, and workflows. If data are not tracked properly during the lifecycle, it becomes unfeasible to recreate a ML model from scratch or to explain to stackholders how it was created. The main limitation of provenance tracking solutions is that they cannot cope with provenance capture and integration of domain and ML data processed in the multiple workflows in the lifecycle, while keeping the provenance capture overhead low. To handle this problem, in this paper we contribute with a detailed characterization of provenance data in the ML lifecycle in CSE; a new provenance data representation, called PROV-ML, built on top of W3C PROV and ML Schema; and extensions to a system that tracks provenance from multiple workflows to address the characteristics of ML and CSE, and to allow for provenance queries with a standard vocabulary.

Thanks to the remarkable advance of IT technology, the CSE community is challenging more complex and difficult problems than ever before, by running these simulations online. In this regard, we often witness that 1) online simulation users suffer from knowing little about the estimated termination time of their launched simulations and 2) the limited computing resources are squandered by wrong input that leads the simulations to run forever. To address such issues, we propose a novel execution time estimation scheme, termed EXTES, using machine learning techniques for more efficient online CSE simulations. With a large amount of existing provenance data, the EXTES scheme trains a suite of models rooted from classification, regression, and a hybrid of the two and utilize these models to estimate the execution time for specified input parameters for simulations.

However, predicting the execution times of e-Science workflows in heterogeneous distributed systems is a challenging job due to the complex structure of workflows, variations due to input problem-sizes, and heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the shared resources. To this end, we propose two novel workflow execution time-prediction methods based on the machine learning ensemble models. In this paper, we showcase our approach for two different real Grid environments. Our approach can effectively predict the execution time of the scientific workflow applications in the Grid for various problem sizes, Grid sites, and runtime environments. We characterized the workflow performance in the Grid using the attributes that define structure of workflow as well as the execution environment. Contrary to common ensembles, our ensemble systems employed three strong learners, which balance the weaknesses of each other by their strengths to model the workflow execution times. The proposed methods have been thoroughly evaluated for three real-world e-science workflow applications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed multi-model ensemble models can significantly decrease the prediction error (by 50%, on average) as compared with methods based on the radial basis function neural network, local learning, and performance templates. The proposed methods can also be applied with similar effectiveness and without any major modification for other heterogeneous distributed environments, such as the Cloud.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8643927/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/ISORC49007.2020.00030,A Cross-Layer Review of Deep Learning Frameworks to Ease Their Optimization and Reuse,IEEE,Conferences,"Machine learning and especially Deep Learning (DL) approaches are at the heart of many domains, from computer vision and speech processing to predicting trajectories in autonomous driving and data science. Those approaches mainly build upon Neural Networks (NNs), which are compute-intensive in nature. A plethora of frameworks, libraries and platforms have been deployed for the implementation of those NNs, but end users often lack guidance on what frameworks, platforms and libraries to use to obtain the best implementation for their particular needs. This paper analyzes the DL ecosystem providing a structured view of some of the main frameworks, platforms and libraries for DL implementation. We show how those DL applications build ultimately on some form of linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, vector addition, dot product and the like. This analysis allows understanding how optimizations of specific linear algebra functions for specific platforms can be effectively leveraged to maximize specific targets (e.g. performance or power-efficiency) at application level reusing components across frameworks and domains.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112939/,2020 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC),19-21 May 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICAIIC51459.2021.9415186,A Data Augmented Bayesian Network for Node Failure Prediction in Optical Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Failures in optical network backbone can cause significant interruption in internet data traffic. Hence, it is very important to reduce such network outages. Prediction of such failures would be a step forward to avoid such disruption of internet services for users as well as operators. Several research proposals are available in the literature which are applications of data science and machine learning techniques. Most of the techniques rely on significant amount of real time data collection. Network devices are assumed to be equipped to collect data and these are then analysed by different algorithms to predict failures. Every network element which is already deployed in the field may not have these data gathering or analysis techniques designed into them initially. However, such mechanisms become necessary later when they are already deployed in the field. This paper proposes a Bayesian network based failure prediction of network nodes, g., routers etc., using very basic information from the log files of the devices and applying power law based data augmentation to complement for scarce real time information. Numerical results show that network node failure prediction can be performed with high accuracy using the proposed mechanism.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9415186/,2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication (ICAIIC),13-16 April 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00201,A Deep Learning Approach to Sensory Navigation Device for Blind Guidance,IEEE,Conferences,"Sensory navigation device is an important trend in the field of machine learning and data science. Nowadays, more and more sensory navigation devices are built for blind people. The core of such sensory navigation devices for blind people usually is implemented by an Image Recognition Method. To build an image recognition model, many tools and online machine learning platforms are proposed. However, these tools or platforms are not able to completely satisfy the requirements for sensory navigation device. To build a sensory navigation device with satisfying requirements for blind people, an ability of reducing the cost of model training and a capability of user-centric image recognition are the two main issues. Therefore, to address the above issues, we propose a novel approach, namely, DLSNF (Deep-Learning-based Sensory Navigation Framework). Our proposed DLSNF is built based on the YOLO architecture to deal with the reducing cost of model training and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 to take the user-centric image recognition into account. Based on our proposed DLSNF, the real-time image recognition can be trained well and conduct a sensory navigation to help blind people. At the same time, the train model is embedded in NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which is the fastest, most power-efficient embedded AI computing device. For the experiments, we evaluated our proposed DLSNF with a real-world dataset consisting of 4,570 images collected by part-time workers. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed DLSNF more effectively and efficiently beyond the existing baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622939/,2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),28-30 June 2018,ieeexplore

Programming that enhances the high level cognitive skills of individuals is seen as a competency that must be acquired for everyone nowadays. In current programming learning environments, programming is usually done using visual components. However, it is emphasized that there is little contribution to the transition to actual programming languages by programming with visual components in the studies carried out. For this reason, a new programming learning environment has been developed in this study in which everyone can learn programming. To facilitate programming learning and contribute to the transition of actual programming languages, a new programming language is described which is simple syntax and similar to real programming languages. This language is controlled in terms of meaning and grammar with lexical and syntax analysis steps. The specified compiler design techniques are implemented using finite state machines. Analysis of the created programming language is performed by regular expressions. Instead of providing a free workspace for the user, an environment with quests covering programming concepts is presented. This quest based environment aims at the successful learning process by guiding to the user through feedbacks.

However, ML methods usually require intensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders the practical deployment of ML models. In view of this, this paper proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework for speed prediction, which enables the prediction work to be accomplished in a much more timesaving and convenient way as well as in high prediction accuracy. The proposed framework utilizes the Genetic Algorithm (GA) following its four major procedures: Genome coding, Crossover, Mutation and Selection to automatically search for the optimal neural network architectures and hyperparameters. The proposed framework is examined on a real-world large-scale dataset in the city of Berlin, Germany.

We present a new hierarchy of propositional formulæ subclasses for which the SAT and counting SAT problems can be solved in polynomial time. Our tractable subclasses are those propositional formulae in conjunctive normal form where any set of k + 1 clauses are related, i.e., there exists at least one literal in one clause that appears negated in another clause of the considered set of k + 1 clauses. We say this subclass of formulæ is of rank k and it is different from previously known subclasses that are solvable in polynomial time. This is an improvement over the SAT Dichotomy Theorem and the counting SAT Dichotomy Theorem, since our subclass can be moved out from the ¿P-complete class to the P class. The membership problem for this new subclass can be solved in O(n·l<sup>k+1</sup>), where n, l and k are the number of variables, clauses and the rank (1 ¿ k ¿ l - 1), respectively.

Both requirements are met by the respective outcomes of ontological and knowledge engineering initiatives. In this paper we discuss a novel, knowledge-based approach to resource synthesis (service composition), which draws on the functionality of semantic Web services to represent and expose available resources. The approach we use exploits domain knowledge to guide the service composition process and provide advice on service selection and instantiation. The approach has been implemented in a prototype workflow construction environment that supports the runtime recommendation of a service solution, service discovery via semantic service descriptions, and knowledge-based configuration of selected services. The use of knowledge provides a basis for full automation of service composition via conventional planning algorithms.

10.1109/FCCM.2017.58,Accelerating Large-Scale Graph Analytics with FPGA and HMC,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph analytics that explores the relationship among interconnected entities is becoming increasingly important due to its broad applicability from machine learning to social science. However, one major challenge for graph processing systems is the irregular data access pattern of graph computation which can significantly degrade the performance. The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit.

In this paper, we accelerated the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, one of the popular algorithm in machine learning and cognitive science, since the ANN algorithm needs to be faster for solving more complex problem or operating in real-time. The ANN algorithm has great potential for GPU acceleration since it is constructed with large data-parallel computations. We implemented forwarding computation of ANN in CUDA and optimized it using scratchpad memory of GPUs and leveraging the thread block size.

10.1109/BigData.2014.7004374,Access-averse framework for computing low-rank matrix approximations,IEEE,Conferences,"Low-rank matrix approximations play important roles in many statistical, scientific, and engineering applications. To compute such approximations, different algorithms have been developed by researchers from a wide range of areas including theoretical computer science, numerical linear algebra, statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, machine learning, and physical and biological sciences. In this paper, to combine these efforts, we present an “access-averse” framework which encapsulates some of the existing algorithms for computing a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). This framework not only allows us to develop software whose performance can be tuned based on domain specific knowledge, but it also allows a user from one discipline to test an algorithm from another, or to combine the techniques from different algorithms. To demonstrate this potential, we implement the framework on multicore CPUs with multiple GPUs and compare the performance of two representative algorithms, blocked variants of matrix power and Lanczos methods. Our performance studies with large-scale graphs from real applications demonstrate that, when combined with communication-avoiding and thick-restarting techniques, the Lanczos method can be competitive with the power method, which is one of the most popular methods currently used for these applications. InIn addition, though we only focus on the truncated SVDs, the two computational kernels used in our studies, the sparse-matrix dense-matrix multiply and tall-skinny QR factorization, are fundamental building blocks for computing low-rank approximations with other objectives. Hence, our studies may have a greater impact beyond the truncated SVDs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7004374/,2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),27-30 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore

Then, two embryonic communities and an undecided node set are generated through performing diffusing operation on such two points. Subsequently, an experience rule is used to classify the undecided nodes to form the final community structure.

The project takes into account the analysis and processing of multifaceted archaeological evidences in a context-oriented environment, in which interdisciplinary contributions of several scientist are combined and integrated, in order to grasp the original system of interaction of different branches of the ancient reality. Such a cooperation needs a system of ""query/communication"" able to integrate archaeological data, artefacts and architectural structures (subsoil and over-ground), cartographic and photographic documentation and scientific contents, achieved in the past and implemented during the field research. The proposed ecosystem aims to provide a set of services for federating different existing data-sources (GIS, including 3D tools), through the definition of a semantic network of relationships among landscapes, stratigraphic layers, structures and artefacts of an excavation site (ArchMatrix).

Ant Colony Systems, in particular, are inspiring. They commonly have drawn inspiration from the behaviors of real ants in nature in order to construct routes between the food sources and the nest. There are still gaps in alternative options for path decision in ant agents. Bellman's equation has been successfully used to solve path decision problems in machine learning. We proposed to investigate impact of a Bellman's equation inspired algorithm for path decision on stigmergic ant agent robotic devices. A design science research paradigm was used to design our research experiment in which a simulated environment was designed to simulate the behavior of ant agents when using a Bellman's equation inspired algorithm for path decision. We introduced a reward function to the orientation process of ant agents. Reward function rewards a decision made when an ant moves from one point to an adjacent cell. The Bellman's inspired algorithm for ant orientation led to convergence of ant agents even though there was reduced quality of convergence. Evaluation of results show that Bellman's equation can be used in path decision processes for ant agent robotic devices.

10.1109/ICSME.2019.00057,Application of Philosophical Principles in Linux Kernel Customization,IEEE,Conferences,"Philosophical principles are very useful in customization of Linux kernel, e.g., the answer for the question: ""For the pointer to the start address of page table, is it a physical address or a virtual address?"" can be derived by one simple philosophical principle: the depth of recursion is limited. This is because if the pointer were a virtual address, there would be another new page table to store the translation information of this virtual address, but who was responsible for storing the translation information of the start address of this new page table? This would result an infinite recursion. So the pointer definitely is a physical address. In fact, the usefulness of philosophical principles comes from the reduction of searching space. And this reduction is very important in customization of Linux kernel, for it could cut down the size of the new code needed to be read. This is especially valuable when considering that Linux kernel is continuously updating and huge now. Another example to further demonstrate the reduction of searching space in customization is showed in the following: in customization of file system in kernel version 3.10, the question: ""Does the Linux kernel itself maintain the consistency between the buffer cache and the page cache?"". This is a hard problem in practice, for without any guidance of philosophical principle, a developer has to read all of the code in Linux kernel to get a precise answer. The tricky part of this question is that if the developer only read a part of the codes and doesn't find any mechanisms for maintenance of cache consistency, the conclusion of non-existence of such mechanisms still can not be drawn, for there's still a possibility that such mechanisms exist in the codes not explored. Besides, if the developer search internet to find the answer, assume that the developer is lucky enough, he/she finally finds one program example on a web page shows that the inconsistency may raise between buffer cache and page cache. He/she still can not get the conclusion that Linux kernel does not maintain such consistency, because that program example maybe is only valid in a specific scenario, e.g. in kernel version 2.26, not 3.10. But we can get a satisfied answer by using the philosophical principle: the cost of management process should be far less than the value created by being managed process. By this principle, it can be drawn that Linux kernel doesn't maintain the consistency between the buffer cache and page cache in kernel 3.10. This is because that the data in buffer cache and page cache is highly dependent on application logic, so if Linux kernel wanted to maintain such consistency, it would have to track all these applications, which cost was much higher than the benefits that these applications could produce. However, the successful application of philosophical principles depends on two factors: firstly, establishment of a mapping between concepts in Linux system and well-known concepts in human society. This is not a new idea, e.g. the word of ""cost"" is a concept first appeared in human society, not in computer science, but nowadays, developers establish a mapping between this concept and concepts in computer science. Although the idea is very old, it is still very effective. Since well-known concepts in human society are familiar to most developers and are what they have in common, the cost of applying philosophical principles is reduced. Besides this, already existing cause-effect relations among concepts in human society can be highly possible to be reused in philosophical deduction in Linux kernel. E.g, in the mapping we established, process is treated as a human and since in religion of human society, God creates humankind, it is natural to derive that there's one process that creates all other processes in Linux system with high probability. Secondly, a concrete model with many qualitative and quantitative details should be the basis of philosophical deduction. We build such model according to our past experiences and the construction of the model follows the philosophical principle: unfold the complexity only when it is necessary. E.g., in this model, for a specific detail, it is covered only when it is required in practice. This is to lower down the cost of modelling huge and continuously evolving Linux kernel. This model is very important, without it, philosophical deduction is impossible. But it is really a hard work, according to our experiences, it needs at least 6-years of work on Linux kernel for one developer to build it. Although philosophical principles are very useful in practice, there's a big gap on the recognition of philosophical principles between academic researchers and industry practioners. E.g., some academic researcher seriously doubts whether the mapping above, which mentioned God, is helpful. In fact, it is, for by this mapping, a developer will know that the existence of the process, which is the origin of all other processes, is highly possible and also that process maybe is not easily observed. This is true, for that process is the process which PID is zero and that process can not be observed by Linux command: ""ps -e"". That process is a very valuable point of customization, e.g., by modifying that process, all processes in the Linux will be affected. Why does this big gap exist? We believe there're at least three reasons: i. The bias on philosophical principles. This usually comes from the observation that some developers establish wrong mapping between the philosophical principles and the objects in real world. But is that true for those that has been verified many times in practice? ii. Wrong expectations. E.g., hope to get the precise answer when applying philosophical principles, instead of reducing the searching space. iii. Some academic researchers do not realize that a good philosophical principle usually is the result of a deep learning process of many years by human brain. Finally, we suggest that more efforts should be put on the studying of philosophical principles in program understanding and we believe that in the near future, the philosophical principles plus AI will be a trend in program understanding.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919057/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

The paper also tries to create relations between the main AI approaches and which type of tests they are applied to, in particular white-box, grey-box and black-box software testing types. We conclude that black-box testing is, by far, the preferred method of software testing, when AI is applied, and all three methods of ML (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement) are commonly used in black-box testing being the “clustering” technique, Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms applied to “fuzzing” and regression testing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9141124/,2020 15th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI),24-27 June 2020,ieeexplore

Computing Science students and practitioners use it to model real world objects and simulate problems in several disciplines such as mathematics, artificial intelligence, games or linguistics. Based on the assessment made by the proponents, little percentage of the students who took the course were able to retain knowledge on its theoretical foundation, while none on the application side. It was further supported by some literature that some computing students find difficulties in learning this course. The main reason is the knowledge retention because they cannot remember their previous lessons. This research can be a useful contribution in designing a better e-learning application particularly for the Computing Science students. Given the right feature, the mobile application can benefit both the educational institution, students and faculty members.

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool. It is the first platform to offer a feature management component that is a general-purpose aggregation framework with lambda architecture and temporal joins. Bighead is deployed and widely adopted at Airbnb, and has enabled the data science and engineering teams to develop and deploy machine learning models in a timely and reliable manner. Bighead has shortened the time to deploy a new model from months to days, ensured the stability of the models in production, facilitated adoption of cutting-edge models, and enabled advanced machine learning based product features of the Airbnb platform.

Easy access to massive data sets, data analytics tools and High-Performance Computing (HPC) have been fueling this revolution. In many ways, cognification is similar to the electrification revolution that took place more than a century ago when electricity became a ubiquitous commodity that could be accessed with ease from anywhere in order to transform mechanical processes into their electrical counterparts. In this paper, we consider two particular forms of distributed computing - Data Centers and HPC systems - and argue that they are ripe for cognification of their entire ecosystem, ranging from top-level applications down to low-level resource and power management services. We present our vision for what ""Cognified Distributed Computing"" might look like and outline some of the challenges that need to be addressed and new technologies that need to be developed in order to make it a reality.

Due to the necessity of using different data processing technologies general interest in hybrid systems is a fast growing research area. To support the integration of intercommunicating hybrids the paper suggests the use of distributed software architectures. The main advantages of the approach presented in the paper are the encapsulation of different paradigms, the separation of control and domain knowledge and the reduction of the complexity of individual problem solvers. The first section of the paper gives an overview of the state of the art in hybrid processing. A taxonomy of currently known hybrid system approaches is discussed. Because of the special importance of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) the author examines issues and research directions in this field and concludes with the presentation of DAI as an integrative paradigm. The author then describes a case study. He gives an overview of the domain (economics) and discuss some prediction methods usually used in this area.

Therefore, methodologies and supporting tools are essential to help the developer construct suitable ontologies for the given purposes and to verify the ontology its fitness of purpose and its reusability. In this paper we propose a novel approach for analyzing ontologies based on the formal concept analysis (FCA) with context family model and build a new tool that extracts main elements (class, property and individual etc.) from the source code of Web ontology language (OWL) and then detects some structural problems.

This can still be done best and most accurately by human, on the other hand, we can of ten accept certain error in the classification in exchange for its speed. Here, natural language processing mechanism transforms the text in natural language to a form understandable by a classifier such as K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Network or Support Vector Machines. We can also use this human element to help automated classification to improve its accuracy by means of crowdsourcing. This work deals with classification of text documents and its improvement through crowdsourcing.

Using this representation we then build a predictive analytics stack that is able to predict online learners behavior as the course progresses in real time.

A scientist working on detecting anomalies in a phenomenon, does not need to re-invent matrix multiplication techniques to solve her problem. Scientific workflows provide ultimate `delegation' mechanism - where a domain scientist can completely forget the specifics of `how' her program will execute on a large cluster in an efficient and cost-effective manner and can instead focus on the mathematical formulation and theoretical robustness of her solution. We present here an approach that directly aims to make the execution of Scientific Workflows more reliable, robust and efficient. We aim that the work presented in this paper will propel the larger effort, from the scientific workflow community, of making scientific workflow execution as simple, efficient and robust as a JOIN operation in a modern database. Specifically, we apply Deep Learning techniques to develop a mechanism that forecasts the final state (success or failure) of a dynamic job in a large-scale particle physics experiment, with minimal data gathering, and as early as possible in job's life cycle. The key advantage of having a predictive mechanism to identify and anticipate failure-prone jobs is the potential for designing intelligent Fault Tolerance mechanisms to handle anomalous events. We achieve a 14% improvement in computational resources utilization, and an overall classification accuracy of 85% on real tasks executed in a High Energy Physics Computing workflow.

Exact science applications deal with the information by modeling and thereafter identifying the relationships in the model by suitable computation. In contrast, the fuzzy logic employment in soft sciences is not as straightforward as it is in exact sciences and special care should be taken in the former case. Analogous to exact sciences, the majority of soft information sources belongs to soft sciences where the quantities dealt with are usually not measurable in the engineering sense. Therefore, for soft sciences fuzzy logic is an important means for dealing with associated imprecise information processing.

Complementary and alternative to supervised machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. However, powerful modern supercomputers provide the opportunity to narrow the gap between theory and practical application. We present our first step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. In several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in capturing physically meaningful coherent structures from observational and simulated scientific data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the first application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing good performance along with ensuring domain scientists' productivity. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed and optimized DisCo workflow and libraries, performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer obtaining 91% weak-scaling and 64% strong-scaling efficiency.

While floating point arithmetic often appears to be arithmetic using real numbers, or at least numbers in scientific notation, it actually has a wide range of gotchas.

This complexity is only increasing as different levels of precision are becoming more common and there are even proposals to automatically reduce program precision (reducing power/energy and increasing performance) when results are deemed """"good enough.'"""" Are software developers who depend on floating point aware of these issues? Do they understand how floating point can bite them?

10.1109/CSNet47905.2019.9108976,Dynamic security management driven by situations: An exploratory analysis of logs for the identification of security situations,IEEE,Conferences,"Situation awareness consists of ""the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future"". Being aware of the security situation is then mandatory to launch proper security reactions in response to cybersecurity attacks. Security Incident and Event Management solutions are deployed within Security Operation Centers. Some vendors propose machine learning based approaches to detect intrusions by analysing networks behaviours. But cyberattacks like Wannacry and NotPetya, which shut down hundreds of thousands of computers, demonstrated that networks monitoring and surveillance solutions remain insufficient. Detecting these complex attacks (a.k.a. Advanced Persistent Threats) requires security administrators to retain a large number of logs just in case problems are detected and involve the investigation of past security events. This approach generates massive data that have to be analysed at the right time in order to detect any accidental or caused incident. In the same time, security administrators are not yet seasoned to such a task and lack the desired skills in data science. As a consequence, a large amount of data is available and still remains unexplored which leaves number of indicators of compromise under the radar. Building on the concept of situation awareness, we developed a situation-driven framework, called dynSMAUG, for dynamic security management. This approach simplifies the security management of dynamic systems and allows the specification of security policies at a high-level of abstraction (close to security requirements). This invited paper aims at exposing real security situations elicitation, coming from networks security experts, and showing the results of exploratory analysis techniques using complex event processing techniques to identify and extract security situations from a large volume of logs.

This study sought to utilize the data collected from virtual reality (VR)-based software and a leap-motion device used for learning in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases to enable early detection of MCI by analyzing the classification rules for errors (action slips) based on finger-action transitions when performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Finger motion was recorded as a time-series database. An induction technique known as Inductive-Logic Programming (ILP), which uses logical and clausal language to represent the training data, was then used to discover a concise classification rule using logical programming.

10.1109/eScience.2019.00047,Efficient Runtime Capture of Multiworkflow Data Using Provenance,IEEE,Conferences,"Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) projects are typically developed by multidisciplinary teams. Despite being part of the same project, each team manages its own workflows, using specific execution environments and data processing tools. Analyzing the data processed by all workflows globally is a core task in a CSE project. However, this analysis is hard because the data generated by these workflows are not integrated. In addition, since these workflows may take a long time to execute, data analysis needs to be done at runtime to reduce cost and time of the CSE project. A typical solution in scientific data analysis is to capture and relate the data in a provenance database while the workflows run, thus allowing for data analysis at runtime. However, the main problem is that such data capture competes with the running workflows, adding significant overhead to their execution. To mitigate this problem, we introduce in this paper a system called ProvLake, which adopts design principles for providing efficient distributed data capture from the workflows. While capturing the data, ProvLake logically integrates and ingests them into a provenance database ready for analyses at runtime.

EEGs are typically used to diagnose and monitor disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain death and also to help the advancement of various fields of science such as cognitive science, and psychology. EEG signals usually suffer from a variety of artifacts caused by eye movements, chewing, muscle movements, and electrode pops, which disrupts the diagnosis and hinders precise representation of brain activities.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921432,From information revolution to intelligence revolution: Big data science vs. intelligence science,IEEE,Conferences,"The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 2<sup>1,000</sup> state space, known as `big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom. Highly professional systems may help people to solve typical everyday problems. Towards these objectives, the latest advances in abstract intelligence and intelligence science investigated in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing are well positioned at the center of intelligence revolution.

Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies.

Many of the challenges and ongoing (r)evolutions appear to produce as yet seemingly contradictory requirements and thus produce potentially very interesting research areas.

However, the lack of training data is often a crucial issue for these learning algorithms, the performance accuracy of which relies on the amount and the quality of the available data. This is particularly true when applying ML/DL based methods for specific areas e.g. material characteristics identification, as it requires huge cost of time and manual power getting observational data from real life. In the mean while, simulations on HPC have already been commonly used in computational science due to the fact that it has the ability of generating sufficient and noise free data, which can be used for training the ML/DL based models. However, in order to achieve accurate simulation results the input parameters usually have to be determined and validated by a large number of tests. Furthermore, the evaluation and validation of such input parameters for the simulation often require a deep understanding of the domain specific knowledge, software and programming skills, which can in turn be solved by ML/DL based methods. In this paper, a novel hybrid workflow combining a multi-task neural network and the simulation on high performance computers(HPC) is proposed, which can address the problem of data sparsity and reduce the demand for expertise, resources, and time in determining the validated parameters for simulation.

To manage this complexity, science workflows are created to automate the execution of these computational and data transfer tasks, which significantly improves scientific productivity. As the scale of workflows rapidly increases, detecting anomalous behaviors in workflow executions has become critical to ensure timely and accurate science products. In this paper, we present a set of lightweight machine learning-based techniques, including both supervised and unsupervised algorithms, to identify anomalous workflow behaviors. We perform anomaly analysis on both workflow-level and task-level datasets collected from real workflow executions on a distributed cloud testbed. Results show that the workflow-level analysis employing k-means clustering can accurately cluster anomalous, i.e. failure-prone and poorly performing workflows into statistically similar classes with a reasonable quality of clustering, achieving over 0.7 for Normalized Mutual Information and Completeness scores. These results affirm the selection of the workflow-level features for workflow anomaly analysis. For task-level analysis, the Decision Tree classifier achieves &gt;80% accuracy, while other tested classifiers can achieve &gt;50% accuracy in most cases.

Consequently, developing forensic automatic palmprint identification technology is an urgent and challenging task which deals with latent (i.e., partial) and full palmprints captured or recovered at 500 ppi at least (the current standard in forensic applications) for minutiae-based offline recognition. Moreover, a rigorous quantification of the evidential value of biometrics, such as fingerprints and palmprints, is essential in modern forensic science. Recently, radial triangulation has been proposed as a step towards this objective in fingerprints, using minutiae manually extracted by experts. In this work we help in automatizing such comparison strategy, and generalize it to palmprints. Firstly, palmprint segmentation and enhancement are implemented for full prints feature extraction by a commercial biometric SDK in an automatic way, while features of latent prints are manually extracted by forensic experts. Then a latent-to-full palmprint comparison algorithm based on radial triangulation is proposed, in which radial triangulation is utilized for minutiae modeling. Finally, 22 latent palmprints from real forensic cases and 8680 full palmprints from criminal investigation field are used for performance evaluation. Experimental results proof the usability and efficiency of the proposed system, i.e, rank-l identification rate of 62% is achieved despite the inherent difficulty of latent-to-full palmprint comparison.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6117546/,2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),11-13 Oct. 2011,ieeexplore

To develop them, we face some crucial issues such as choosing proper distributions with enough flexibility to well-fit the data. To learn our model, two other significant challenges, namely, parameter estimation and defining model complexity have to be addressed. Some methods such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference have been widely considered to tackle the first problem and both have some drawbacks such as local maxima or high computational complexity. Simultaneously, the proper number of components was determined with some approaches such as minimum message length. In this work, multivariate Beta mixture models have been deployed thanks to their flexibility and we propose a novel variational inference via an entropy-based splitting method.

10.1109/PDP50117.2020.00041,Lessons learned from comparing C-CUDA and Python-Numba for GPU-Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Python as programming language is increasingly gaining importance, especially in data science, scientific, and parallel programming. It is faster and easier to learn than classical programming languages such as C. However, usability often comes at the cost of performance and applications written in Python are considered to be much slower than applications written in C or FORTRAN. Further, it does not allow the usage of GPUs-besides of pre-compiled libraries.However, the Numba package promises performance similar to C code for compute intensive parts of a Python application and it supports CUDA, which allows the use of GPUs inside a Python application.In this paper we compare the performance of Numba-CUDA and C -CUDA for different kinds of applications. For compute intensive benchmarks, the performance of the Numba version only reaches between 50% and 85% performance of the CCUDA version, despite the reduction operation, where the Numba version outperforms CUDA. Analyzing the PTX code and CUDA performance counters revealed that index-calculation is one limiting factor in Numba. Another problem is the type interference for single precision computations, as some values are computed in double precision. By optimizing this within the Numba package, the performance of Numba improves. However, C-CUDA applications still outperform the Numba versions. Further analysis with the CloverLeav Mini App shows that Numba performance further decreases for applications with multiple different compute kernels. The non-GPU part slows down these applications, due to the slow Python interpreter. This leads to a worse GPU utilization.Today Python is widely used in industry and academia and has been the first choice of coding languages among software programmers in the last years. Currently, according to the TIOBE index [5], it is the 3rd most popular programming language and the number one in IEEE Spectrum's fifth annual interactive ranking of the top programming languages [4]. One reason for this is that is easier to learn than classical programming languages like C. However, the other reason is the increasing popularity of Data Science, where Python is the most used language. A collection of libraries such as NumPy [22], and Matplotlib [1] or Scipy [8] provide a rich set of functions for scientific computing [16]. Packages like Dask [19], PyCompss [21] and MPI for Python [6] allow running Python applications on large, parallel machines, promising high performance. However, the performance of Python is considered slow compared to compiled languages such as C, C++, and FORTRAN, especially for heavy computations. In recent years, more and more tools have been developed to counter this prejudice. Numpy [22], for example, uses C-like arrays to store data and offers fast functions implemented in C to speed up calculations. The CuPy [14] package provides a similar set of functions, but these functions are implemented for GPUs using CUDA. The SciPy library is based on NumPy and provides a rich set on functionalities for scientific computing. Still, the high performance of these libraries is provided by the underling C-implementations. Internally, they use libraries like OpenBlas or IntelMKL to reach high performance and therefore, they are limited by the functions which are provided by theses libraries. Therefore, a performance problem always arises when the required functionality is not implemented within these libraries. In this case, the application falls back to the Python interpreter. Compared to ""bare metal"" code, interpreted code is slow. In addition, in Python it is not possible to use GPUs or other accelerators directly, as the Python interpreter cannot execute code on these machines. Therefore, the usage is only possible with precompiled libraries. To overcome this limitation, different approaches where developed to mix C, CUDA or OpenCL with Python. Cython [2] allows integrating C-code in Python applications to improve performance of critical sections. It also allows an easy development of wrappers for C-libraries. Similar, packages such as PyCuda and PyOpenCL [9] support wrappers for CUDA or OpenCL code within a Python script. Both approaches require the mixture of different programming languages.Numba [10] follows a different approach. Instead of merging C/CUDA code with Python, it allows the development of efficient applications for both, CPUs and GPUs in Python style. When a Python script using Numba is executed, marked functions are compiled just-in-time (JIT) using the LLVM framework. Using Python for GPU programming can mean a considerable simplification in the development of parallel applications.But often a simplification of comes at the expense of performance, and one expects a performance loss from Python compared to pure C code. In this paper, we want to understand the differences between native C-CUDA code and CUDA-code written in Python with Numba. We also want to share some basic tips how to improve the performance of applications written in Numba.We will first analyse a few micro benchmarks in detail. We are using these simple benchmarks, as it is easier to understand the differences with small code examples. We will use the collected information to derive some optimization for Numba. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of a more application like mini-app, written in C-CUDA and Numba accelerated Python. We will evaluate if our insights from the microbenchmarks to real applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9092407/,"2020 28th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP)",11-13 March 2020,ieeexplore

In this scenario it is important to note that several graph searching algorithms that were proposed to give exhaustive searches doesn't provide the most satisfying outcome in terms of asymptotic time complexity. Through this paper we intend to highlight the significance of machine learning as a useful tool that can be incorporated in various graph searching algorithms that can reduce its complexity. We classify the existing graph searching techniques as subsets or modifications of two major conventional graph searching algorithms namely BFS(Breadth First Search) and DFS(Depth First Search) and suggest the application of logistic regression to improve their performance.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00087,Mining the Critical Conditions for New Hypotheses of Materials from Historical Reaction Data,IEEE,Conferences,"The new findings in material science often require a high research cost for the following two aspects. First is that the chemical reaction craft needs continuous optimization and may consume lots of valuable reactants and apparatus during daily experiments. Second, the success of a designed experiment relies heavily on researchers' experience.

10.1109/CEC.2019.8789969,Multiobjective memetic algorithm for vital nodes identification in complex networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Vital nodes identification, that is, finding a set of nodes whose absence would cause a collapse of the network, is a significant project in network science. Despite there are a plenty of methods to identify the vital nodes, two major problems still need to be solved, that is how to select these nodes and how to determine the number of them. In this study, we focus on dealing with these two problems via proposing a multiobjective memetic algorithm for vital nodes identification task. First, vital nodes identification task is modeled as a biobjective optimization problem by analyzing the characteristic of vital nodes. Then, a memetic strategy and specific evolutionary operators inspired by multiple centralities are designed to execute local and global search. In addition, a long-tail property is found from the Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem, and the simulation results always show an obvious knee region. Hence, an adaptive learning method to determine the size of vital nodes is designed by searching for the knee point.

10.1109/COGINF.2006.365669,On Intelligence Science and Recent Progresses,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only given. Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4216384/,2006 5th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics,17-19 July 2006,ieeexplore

We observe that recent innovations in being able to collect, access, organize, integrate, and query massive amounts of data from a wide variety of data sources have brought statistical data mining and machine learning under more scrutiny and evaluation for gleaning insights from the data than ever before. In that context, we pose and debate the question - Are data mining algorithms scaling with the ability to store and compute? If yes, how? If not, why not? We survey recent developments in the state-of-the-art to discuss emerging and outstanding challenges in the design and implementation of machine learning algorithms at scale. We leverage experience from real-world Big Data knowledge discovery projects across domains of national security, healthcare and manufacturing to suggest our efforts be focused along the following axes: (i) the `data science' challenge - designing scalable and flexible computational architectures for machine learning (beyond just data-retrieval); (ii) the ` science of data' challenge - the ability to understand characteristics of data before applying machine learning algorithms and tools; and (iii) the `scalable predictive functions' challenge - the ability to construct, learn and infer with increasing sample size, dimensionality, and categories of labels.

The proposed research will be the part of the overall research project, which focuses on addressing a problem that many organizations experience that introduce an Enterprise Architecture to support the integration of different services across the enterprise. With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models. Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy. Influence of wireless-specific parameters on QoE prediction was also investigated, and it was discovered that they are suitable for use in Quality of Experience prediction models.The problem is that; organizations do not know where they either have or may encounter weaknesses in their Enterprise Architecture with Data Driven Architecture (DDA). The framework presented is based on concepts from Wireless Networks with Driven Architecture will be designed to support both Transitional Gap Analysis (TGA) and Comparative Gap Analysis (CGA).

10.1109/WI.2018.00013,Proposed Computational Classification System of Human Cognitive Biases,IEEE,Conferences,"Despite our aspirations to do so, we humans don't always make optimal or rational decisions. Researchers from psychology, behavioral economics, anthropology, decision sciences, and other related fields have described many human cognitive biases which help to explain such decisions. Most of the time, these cognitive biases are relatively harmless and relatively costless. However, sometimes they do result in significant costs to individuals, companies, governments and societies in the form of wasted or misdirected money, time, effort, and sometimes even in the form of lives lost. The antidote to such decisions has long been recognized to lie in algorithmic decision making. Until relatively recently, though, requirements and complexity of such algorithms have limited their deployment in real-world situations. However, we now enjoy a convergence of computing power, decrease in computing costs, and computational and predictive methods born of data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), such that we can begin to mitigate some of the most negative effects of some of these cognitive biases.

If data are not tracked properly during the lifecycle, it becomes unfeasible to recreate a ML model from scratch or to explain to stackholders how it was created. The main limitation of provenance tracking solutions is that they cannot cope with provenance capture and integration of domain and ML data processed in the multiple workflows in the lifecycle, while keeping the provenance capture overhead low. To handle this problem, in this paper we contribute with a detailed characterization of provenance data in the ML lifecycle in CSE; a new provenance data representation, called PROV-ML, built on top of W3C PROV and ML Schema; and extensions to a system that tracks provenance from multiple workflows to address the characteristics of ML and CSE, and to allow for provenance queries with a standard vocabulary.

Many kinds of data associated with the species can be deployed for this task and many reconstruction methods have been proposed and examined in the literature. One very recent approach is to build a local phylogeny for every subset of 4 species, which is called a quartet for these 4 species, and then to assemble a phylogeny for the whole set of species satisfying these predicted quartets. In general, those predicted quartets might not always agree each other; and thus the objective function becomes to satisfy a maximum number of predicted quartets. This is the well-known maximum quartet consistency (MQC) problem, which is studied by a lot of researchers in the last two decades. We present a new equivalent representation for the MQC problem, that is, to search for an ultrametric matrix to satisfy the maximum number of those predicted quartets. We examine a few number of structural properties of the MQC problem in this new representation, through formulating it into answer set programming (ASP), a recent powerful logic programming tool for modeling and solving searching problems.

Nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties are unavoidable problems faced in controlling robots in industrial plants. Tracking control of a single link manipulator driven by a permanent magnet brushed DC motor is a nonlinear dynamics due to effects of gravitational force, mass of the payload, posture of the manipulator and viscous friction coefficient. Furthermore uncertainties arise because of changes of the rotor resistance with temperature and random variations of friction while operating. Due to this fact classical PID controller can not be used effectively since it is developed based on linear system theory. Neural network control schemes for manipulator control problem have been proposed by researchers; in which their competency is validated through simulation studies. On the other hand, actual real time applications are rarely established. Instead of simulation studies, this paper is aimed to implement neural network controller in real time for controlling a DC motor driven single link manipulator.

This makes the road traffic environment more and more complicated, and people expect to have an intelligent Vision-assisted applications that provide drivers with traffic sign information, regulate driver operations, or assist in vehicle control to ensure road safety. As one of the more important functions, traffic sign detection and recognition[1], has become a hot research direction of researchers at home and abroad. It is mainly the use of vehicle cameras to capture real-time road images, and then to detect and identify the traffic signs encountered on the road, thus providing accurate information to the driving system. However, the road conditions in the actual scene are very complicated. After many years of hard work, researchers have not yet made the recognition system practical, and further research and improvement are still needed. Traditionally, traffic signage has been detected and categorized using standard computer vision methods, but it also takes considerable time to manually process important features of the image. With the development and progress of science and technology, more and more scholars use deep learning technology to solve this problem. The main reason that the deep learning method is widely accepted is that the model can learn the deep features inside the image autonomously from the training samples, especially for many cases that do not know how to design the feature extractor, such as expression recognition, target detection Wait.

With more globalization and technological advancement, The Internet of Things (IoT) has been matured into self sustaining and evolving technology that has the capacity to change the way how physical and cyber worlds interact. We can also say IoT is about anything that can connect everything. With Involvement of Global Corporations, new IoT-based systems are being proposed in almost every sector which humans have so far envisioned. The thoughts (or Science Fiction) which was once fictional and unbelievable are becoming reality, whatever we desire will be available at touch of our finger someday. Mankind is moving fast towards connected future, where not only autonomous vehicles but entire cities infrastructure will be completely internet connected to support rapid urbanization. To reap the full benefit of IoT, it is imperative that the infrastructure we depend upon is adequate to deliver the services envisioned and has the necessary resilience, robustness and security.

The level of autonomy is improving by means of Internet-of-Things (IoT), while the level of intelligence is improving through artificial intelligence. The applications of big data analytics and cloud computing techniques in smart grids are also new topics, which have been paid particular attention recently. These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties. On the other hand, the new structures are evolving toward transactive energy trading models in microgrids. In such a circumstance, a myriad of elements is producing critical data, which should be acquired, transferred, stored, analyzed, and finally, proper controlling actions must be sent. These data are producing at different intervals, even in a fraction of a second. This matter makes it possible to maintain grid security and better real-time operation as well as to get better demand responsiveness. A smart grid consists of many embedded or interconnected systems that are linked to each other through various communication platforms in the cyber layer. A flexible, highly-autonomous, and intelligent smart grid entails an agile communication system, whether wired or wireless. However, cellular networks have prominent benefits.

This needs to be supported by an IoT cyber-infrastructure for reliable and scalable data acquisition from the edge to the Cloud.

The people who are having complete blindness or low vision faces many difficulties during their navigation. Blindness can occur due to many reasons including disease, injury or other conditions that limit vision. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a navigation aid for the blind and the visually impaired people. In this paper, we design and implement a smart cap which helps the blind and the visually impaired people to navigate freely by experiencing their surroundings. The scene around the person will be captured by using a NoIR camera and the objects in the scene will be detected. The earphones will give a voice output describing the detected objects. The architecture of the system includes the processor Raspberry Pi 3, NoIR camera, earphones and a power source. The processor collects the frames of the surroundings and convert it to voice output. The device uses TensorFlow API, open-source machine learning library developed by the Google Brain Team for the object detection and classification. TensorFlow helps in creating machine learning models capable of identifying and classifying multiple objects in a single image. Thus, details corresponding to various objects present within a single frame are obtained using TensorFlow API. A Text to Speech Synthesiser (TTS) software called eSpeak is used for converting the details of the detected object (in text format) to speech output. So the video captured by using the NoIR camera is finally converted to speech signals and thus narration of the scene describing various objects is done.

10.1109/RE.2019.00078,Specifying Requirements through Interaction Design,IEEE,Conferences,"When the requirements and the interaction design of a system are separated, they will most likely not fit together, and the resulting system will be less than optimal. Even if all the real needs are covered in the requirements and also implemented, errors may be induced by human-computer interaction through a bad interaction design and its resulting user interface. Such a system may even not be used at all. Alternatively, a great user interface of a system with features that are not required will not be very useful as well. This tutorial explains joint modeling of (communicative) interaction design and requirements, through discourse models and ontologies. Our discourse models are derived from results of human communication theories, cognitive science and sociology (even without employing speech or natural language). While these models were originally devised for capturing interaction design, it turned out that they can be also viewed as specifying classes of scenarios, i.e., use cases. In this sense, they can also be utilized for specifying requirements. Ontologies are used to define domain models and the domains of discourse for the interactions with software systems. User interfaces for these software systems can be generated semi-automatically from our discourse models, domain-of-discourse models and specifications of the requirements. This is especially useful when user interfaces for different devices are needed. Specific usability requirements can be dealt with in our approach through advanced customization approaches. Hence, inter-action design facilitates requirements engineering to make applications both more useful and usable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920541/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

Delivery tools have been created for conducting the exams from any place. Applying this will lead saving time and travelling cost. Nowadays, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a big demand on the online courses and exams. This paper introduces a new approach for exam proctoring using 360-degree security camera.

10.1109/FOCS.2017.98,Subdeterminant Maximization via Nonconvex Relaxations and Anti-Concentration,IEEE,Conferences,"Several fundamental problems that arise in optimization and computer science can be cast as follows: Given vectors v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>m</sub> ∈ ℝ<sup>d</sup> and a constraint family B ⊆ 2<sup>[m]</sup>, find a set S ∈ B that maximizes the squared volume of the simplex spanned by the vectors in S. A motivating example is the ubiquitous data-summarization problem in machine learning and information retrieval where one is given a collection of feature vectors that represent data such as documents or images. The volume of a collection of vectors is used as a measure of their diversity, and partition or matroid constraints over [m] are imposed in order to ensure resource or fairness constraints. Even with a simple cardinality constraint (B = (<sub>r</sub><sup>[m]</sup>)), the r problem becomes NP-hard and has received much attention starting with a result by Khachiyan [1] who gave an r<sup>O(r)</sup> approximation algorithm for this problem. Recently, Nikolov and Singh [2] presented a convex program and showed how it can be used to estimate the value of the most diverse set when there are multiple cardinality constraints (i.e., when B corresponds to a partition matroid). Their proof of the integrality gap of the convex program relied on an inequality by Gurvits [3], and was recently extended to regular matroids [4], [5]. The question of whether these estimation algorithms can be converted into the more useful approximation algorithms - that also output a set - remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to give the first approximation algorithms for both partition and regular matroids. We present novel formulations for the subdeterminant maximization problem for these matroids; this reduces them to the problem of finding a point that maximizes the absolute value of a nonconvex function over a Cartesian product of probability simplices. The technical core of our results is a new anti-concentration inequality for dependent random variables that arise from these functions which allows us to relate the optimal value of these nonconvex functions to their value at a random point. Unlike prior work on the constrained subdeterminant maximization problem, our proofs do not rely on real-stability or convexity and could be of independent interest both in algorithms and complexity where anti-concentration phenomena has recently been deployed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8104130/,2017 IEEE 58th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS),15-17 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

The hardware manufacture of digital devices was trained to promote the freshmen manipulative capability, while software programming with general-purpose languages was introduced to enhance the comprehension of data analysis in the 2nd academic year.

10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00082,SynC: A Copula based Framework for Generating Synthetic Data from Aggregated Sources,IEEE,Conferences,"A synthetic dataset is a data object that is generated programmatically, and it may be valuable to creating a single dataset from multiple sources when direct collection is difficult or costly. Although it is a fundamental step for many data science tasks, an efficient and standard framework is absent. In this paper, we study a specific synthetic data generation task called downscaling, a procedure to infer high-resolution, harder-to-collect information (e.g., individual level records) from many low-resolution, easy-to-collect sources, and propose a multi-stage framework called SynC (Synthetic Data Generation via Gaussian Copula). For given low-resolution datasets, the central idea of SynC is to fit Gaussian copula models to each of the low-resolution datasets in order to correctly capture dependencies and marginal distributions, and then sample from the fitted models to obtain the desired high-resolution subsets. Predictive models are then used to merge sampled subsets into one, and finally, sampled datasets are scaled according to low-resolution marginal constraints. We make four key contributions in this work: 1) propose a novel framework for generating individual level data from aggregated data sources by combining state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques, 2) perform simulation studies to validate SynC's performance as a synthetic data generation algorithm, 3) demonstrate its value as a feature engineering tool, as well as an alternative to data collection in situations where gathering is difficult through two real-world datasets, 4) release an easy-to-use framework implementation for reproducibility and scalability at the production level that easily incorporates new data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346329/,2020 International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),17-20 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109799,The power of cognitive computing: An example of cognitive dynamic regional development modeling,IEEE,Conferences,"This presentation concerns some idea of what could be done, in the author's view, to help make Wang's cognitive informatics a powerful and viable source of tools and techniques for solving various real life problems. First, we give a brief account of cognitive informatics meant as a multidisciplinary field within informatics, or computer science, that is based on results of cognitive and information sciences, and which deals with human information processing mechanisms and processes and their decision theoretic, engineering, etc. applications in broadly perceived computing. We focus on its purpose, i.e. to develop and implement technologies to facilitate and extend the information acquisition, comprehension and processing capacity of humans. Emphasis is on underlying processes in the brain. However, we advocate an extended approach in which though the very cognitive informatics is the foundation, as those processes in the brain are crucial, some sort of an “outer” cognitive informatics is needed which explicitly makes reference not what proceeds “internally” in the brain, because we do not “see” this, but “externally”, i.e. what people can see, judge, evaluate, etc., and what is clearly a result of cognitive information specific processes in the brain. This line of reasoning is in line with the very essence of comprehension, memorizing, learning, choice and decision making, satisfaction with partial truth, allowing for not perfect solutions, etc. dealt with using tools and techniques derived from many areas like psychology, behavioral science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroeconomics etc. In our case, we will concentrate on some cognitive informatics type elements that mostly have been inspired by psychology and behavioral sciences, as our problem is inherently related to human judgments and perceptions, but we will mentioned some inspirations from neuroscience, notably along the lines of neuroeconomics. Cognitive informatics constitutes a foundation of its related new field, cognitive computing, which is basically a new direction in broadly perceived intelligent computing and systems that synergistically combines results from many areas, e.g., information science, computational sciences, computer science, artificial and computational intelligence, cybernetics, systems science, cognitive science, (neuro)psychology, brain science, linguistics, etc. to just mention a few. We try to show on an example of a dynamic systems modeling, more specifically scenario based regional development planning, that cognitive computing can provide new conceptual and implementation vistas. Basically, we consider a region that is characterized by 7 life quality indicators related to economic, social, environmental, etc. qualities, which evolve over some planning horizon due to some investments, mostly by some regional or governmental agencies. There are some scenarios of investment levels over the planning horizon, meant for the development of the particular life quality indexes, and some desired levels of these indexes, both objective, i.e. set by authorities, and subjective, i.e. perceived by the inhabitant groups. As a result of a particular investment scenario, the life quality indexes evolve over the planning horizon, and their temporal evolution is evaluated by the authorities and inhabitants. This evaluation has both an objective, i.e. against the “officially” set thresholds, and subjective, i.e. as perceived by various humans and their groups. Basically, we employ Kacprzyk's fuzzy dynamic programming based approach to the modeling and planning/programming of sustainable regional development, with soft constraints and goals, but we advocated a more sophisticated assessment of variability, stability, balancedness of consecutive investments. In this process we try to develop evaluation measures, and then the optimization type model using concepts that can be effectively and efficiently handled by cognitive computing, notably the inclusion of the so called decision making and behavioral biases, biases in probability and belief, social biases, memory errors, etc. Moreover, we strongly reflect the so called status quo and minimal change biases. By using many results from social sciences, psychology, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, etc. on human judgments and human centric evaluations, we augment a traditional purely effectiveness and efficiency oriented analysis by a more sophisticated analysis of effects of variability of temporal evolution of some life quality indicators on the human perception of its goodness. The model presented, which has been employed for years as part of large mathematical modeling projects for sustainable regional development in many regions in Asia and Europe, is illustrated on an example with scenario analysis for a rural region plagued by social and economic difficulties in which subsidies should properly be distributed over time to obtain a best overall socioeconomic effect. In this talk we present the model in a different perspective, based first on the basic Wang's cognitive informatics and its Wang and Ruhe's decision making application, and then based on new, more comprehensive cognitive computing. We show that this provides a novel insight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8109799/,2017 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),26-28 July 2017,ieeexplore

10.1109/CCGrid.2015.74,Towards a Realistic Scheduler for Mixed Workloads with Workflows,IEEE,Conferences,"Many fields of modern science require huge amounts of computation, and workflows are a very popular tool in e-Science since they allow to organize many small, simple tasks to solve big problems. They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhDresearch is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types. We are in the process of simulating policies, and we will validate our results by means of an implementation and real-world experiments with the KOALA-Workflow processing system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7152549/,"2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",4-7 May 2015,ieeexplore

In this paper, we propose an distributionally robust learning method to train classifiers via solving an unconstrained minimax game between an adversary test distribution and a hypothesis.

10.1109/ICSESS.2013.6615322,Transformative education Web 2.0 systems for enriching high school STEM education,IEEE,Conferences,"There are currently over a hundred STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) programs in the U.S., aimed at encouraging students to enter a STEM-related career. Of the fields encompassed by STEM, mathematics is the foundation. However, American teens have demonstrated less ability and aptitude for mathematics than the teens in many other countries. Efforts to reduce this ability gap have focused on building a better communal structure within schools, creating more cohesive math curricula, offering smaller classes, encouraging cooperative learning, and helping students overcome math anxiety at school. There is very little published literature on the potential of guided cyber-based self-learning in STEM education, although there are a variety of online STEM learning web sites available for students to access at or after school. In particular, no scientific approach exists to address STEM education challenges in an outside-school setting. The paper briefly unveil an approach to transformatively addressing how mathematics learning, outside of a formal high school setting, could contribute to students' math aptitude.

The last decade has witnessed tremendous advancement of tensor computation and its applications in machine learning and big data. However, its hardware optimization on resource-constrained devices remains an (almost) unexplored field.

In order to further reduce the computing time, a warm-start algorithm for the Jacobi iterations in SVD is proposed. A fixed-point simulator is used to evaluate the performance of our design. Some synthetic data sets and a real MRI data set are used to validate the design and evaluate its performance.

10.1109/CEC.2014.6900322,Type-II opposition-based differential evolution,IEEE,Conferences,"The concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) can be categorized into Type-I and Type-II OBL methodologies. The Type-I OBL is based on the opposite points in the variable space while the Type-II OBL considers the opposite of function value on the landscape. In the past few years, many research works have been conducted on development of Type-I OBL-based approaches with application in science and engineering, such as opposition-based differential evolution (ODE). However, compared to Type-I OBL, which cannot address a real sense of opposition in term of objective value, the Type-II OBL is capable to discover more meaningful knowledge about problem's landscape. Due to natural difficulty of proposing a Type-II-based approach, very limited research has been reported in that direction. In this paper, for the first time, the concept of Type-II OBL has been investigated in detail in optimization; also it is applied on the DE algorithm as a case study. The proposed algorithm is called opposition-based differential evolution Type-II (ODE-II) algorithm; it is validated on the testbed proposed for the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2013 (IEEE CEC-2013) contest with 28 benchmark functions.

Examples include hardware principles, architecture and theory, along with software development tools and processes. Recent studies have suggested that a focus on the computational infrastructure in the absence of an external application domain may reinforce the stereotype of CS student fixation on the computer for some, while alienating a subset of students, especially women, who may be attracted to using the computer to solve broader problems. Recognizing this situation has inspired recent explorations on teaching computer science within an application context. Even classes traditionally focused on techniques and problems beyond the computer itself, such as Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are often presented as a collection of techniques, programs, and principles without systematic ""real-world"" grounding.

In order to achieve an efficient human-centered governance of artificial intelligent systems, it has been proposed to harness augmented utilitarianism (AU), a novel non-normative ethical framework grounded in science which can be assisted e.g. by Extended Reality (XR) technologies. While AU provides a scaffold to encode human ethical and legal conceptions in a machine-readable form, the filling in of these conceptions requires a transdisciplinary amalgamation of scientific insights and preconditions from manifold research areas. In this short paper, we present a compact review on how XR technologies could leverage the underlying transdisciplinary AI governance approach utilizing the AU framework.

10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378023,Zero-Shot Machine Learning Technique for Classification of Multi-User Big Data Workloads,IEEE,Conferences,"During the last decade machine learning has revolutionized computer science applications. Supervised machine learning algorithms have become especially successful in many industries including health, legal, security, finance, travel, and others. Training supervised learning algorithms, however, is expensive because the real world contains a very large number of different classes that need to be covered by the training set. This is especially true for the highly variable, multi-user workload data produced by the strategically vital big data and cloud software stacks. It is very important, however, to be able to accurately classify these complex workloads in order to enable autonomic management and optimization. Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is an advanced machine learning approach that enables classification of objects without having to explicitly train on examples of those objects. In this paper we present a new ZSL technique intended to reduce the expense of assembling workload training sets for big data analytic workloads. We demonstrate that multi-user big data workloads can be treated as hybrids of simpler, single-user workload classes, and classified accurately without having to explicitly train on example instances of multi-user workloads.

10.1109/AIMS.2014.74,[Keynote Speaker-2] Challenges in Handling and Processing Huge Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only given, as follows. Data-intensive computing is considered as the fourth paradigm in science. The term “data-intensive computing” did not establish in other communities although they are also confronted with enormous amounts of data. Nowadays, Big Data refers to data sets that are too large, too complex, too distributed for analysing them by conventional methods. One strategy for handling Big Data is known as “software to the data” which is applicable when it is more efficient to bring the analysis tools to the data than, vice versa, to apply traditional methods where, for example, all data are collected at some place and analysed there. The data production rate is expected to increase exponentially for the time being. This is particularly true in science where the resolution power of experiments is steadily improving. Sooner or later it has to be taken into account that it is not feasible to store all data anymore. A new era is on the horizon: Huge Data. Huge Data have to be pre-analysed during the data-taking period in order to extract a sufficiently small subset of data that is worth to be analysed in more detail later on. An effective and efficient preselection in real-time or near-realtime is most critical for successfully handling Huge Data. This is made more challenging if during the pre-analysis that has to be done in parallel, intermediate results have to be exchanged. The talk considers selected challenges of Huge Data. Some examples from different scientific communities are presented.

So we designed a new system based on the data of walking called iWalk to identify the user's identity. The most challenging task is to choose the features of walking that can represent each person's identity. IWalk collects data based on accelerometers built into Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smartphones and uses the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) method to determine whether the current user is the owner of the phone. The data we used for training and evaluation were collected by 16 volunteers from real activities.

In the recent paradigm where objects in the world will be connected with each other, commonly referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT), people begin to consider the challenges and opportunities to utilize the huge data sets generated, also referred to as Big data. One of the active research topics in dealing with the IoT's big data is the practical feasibility of algorithms used in classical machine learning but also in a newly emerging branch, called deep learning. In this article, we demonstrate a quantitative analysis comparing performance between classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms with a human movement direction detecting application based on analog pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor signals. The sensing data acquisition and retrieval system is implemented with the open-source IoT software platforms based on the oneM2M standard. With the analog PIR data sets collected from 30 subjects, we perform experimental studies comparing classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms in terms of economic feasibility, scalability, generality, and real-time detection performance. The results show that classical machine learning shows better performance in real-time detection (i.e., with the sensing values within the first 0.5 s). In contrast, our simple deep learning model achieves about 90% accuracy for detecting moving directions even with the data sets from only three subjects and a single PIR sensor.

However, the complexity of multi-modal data, the establishment of correlations between consumer genetic data and product ingredients are the main obstacles encountered today. Determining to settle such obstacles, a personalised recommendation expert system for selecting optimised skin-health product within the category based upon genetic phenotypes for each consumer was introduced in this article. Random Forests were implemented to achieve automatic product categorisation, the performance discussed and compared with SVM and Logistic Regression.

In this letter, we propose anew compact and high-performing place recognition model that bridges this divide for the first time. Our approach comprises two key neural models of these categories: (1) FlyNet, a compact, sparse two-layer neural network inspired by brain architectures of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, and (2) a one-dimensional continuous attractor neural network (CANN). The resulting FlyNet+CANN network incorporates the compact pattern recognition capabilities of our FlyNet model with the powerful temporal filtering capabilities of an equally compact CANN, replicating entirely in a hybrid neural implementation the functionality that yields high performance in algorithmic localization approaches like SeqSLAM. We evaluate our model, and compare it to three state-of-the-art methods, on two benchmark real-world datasets with small viewpoint variations and extreme environmental changes - achieving 87% AUC results under day to night transitions compared to 60% for Multi-Process Fusion, 46% for LoST-X and 1% for SeqSLAM, while being 6.5, 310, and 1.5 times faster, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8962234/,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,April 2020,ieeexplore

The ability of working in teams is crucial in educating professionals. The literature proves that social relations influence the performance of teams. For instance, the team cohesion is directly related with its performance. In this paper, we have developed an agent-based tool for assisting teachers in simulating their teaching strategies to estimate their influence on the group sociometrics like cohesion, coherence of reciprocal relations, dissociation, and density of relations. The experiments with nine scenarios in disciplines of computer science, electronic, psychology, business, tourism, and renewal energies with 239 students and 6 teachers including experienced and novice ones show that its underlying agent-based framework can adapt to different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction quality of the dissociation in higher education, due to the usual low amounts or absence of reciprocal rejections in the students' groups in this educational stage.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved.

Convolutional neural networks are developed, trained, and evaluated with the use of images from a moving vehicle camera. The images are preprocessed and converted to suitable matrices, so that only the useful information for the empty on-street parking space detection problem is preserved. The optimized convolutional networks, in terms of structural and learning parameters, provided predictions for the detection of empty on-street parking spaces with approximately 90% average accuracy.

The fidelity of the model determines the quality and reliability of the decision-making; however, the intrinsic complexity of many real-world decision problems leads to significant model mismatch or infeasibility in deriving a model using the first principle. To overcome the challenges that are present in the big data era, both researchers and practitioners emphasize the importance of making decisions that are backed up by data related to decision tasks, a process called data-driven decision-making (D<sup>3</sup>M). By building on data science, not only can decision models be predicted in the presence of uncertainty or unknown dynamics, but also inherent rules or knowledge can be extracted from data and directly utilized to generate decision solutions. This position paper systematically discusses the basic concepts and prevailing techniques in data-driven decision-making and clusters-related developments in technique into two main categories: programmable data-driven decision-making (P-D<sup>3</sup>M) and nonprogrammable data-driven decision-making (NP-D<sup>3</sup>M).

As a real use case, we implement a question-based dialog application for inquiry-based learning and ignorance modeling with our infrastructure. Additionally, we explore the possibility of using social bots to connect the services provided by the decentralized infrastructure to communication tools already present in most communities (e.g., chat platforms). Following a design science approach, we describe a multistep evaluation of both the infrastructure and application, together with the improvements made to the resulting artifacts of each step.

In addition, by adapting the designed system to simple, fast and user-friendly mobile software, it will be possible to provide tests in enterprise environments in a shorter time. In the design of the system, deep learning models, which have been used frequently in recent years in computer science, have been used. The CNN model, which was trained with a 94.69% success rate through these data, has been converted into a mobile-friendly format for real-time tests. It is aimed to make real-time tests and provide easy access for dairy producers with the help of the designed mobile software. In order to increase the success of the CNN architecture, pre-trained networks have been utilized. In the study, VGG19 pre-trained network, whose success rate has been proved in the previous studies conducted in the literature, was used in model design. The 78.0% performance results obtained from the study indicate that pre-trained CNN architectures based on deep learning are successful for the real-time BCS classification problem.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9272284/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Thanks to the remarkable advance of IT technology, the CSE community is challenging more complex and difficult problems than ever before, by running these simulations online. In this regard, we often witness that 1) online simulation users suffer from knowing little about the estimated termination time of their launched simulations and 2) the limited computing resources are squandered by wrong input that leads the simulations to run forever. To address such issues, we propose a novel execution time estimation scheme, termed EXTES, using machine learning techniques for more efficient online CSE simulations. With a large amount of existing provenance data, the EXTES scheme trains a suite of models rooted from classification, regression, and a hybrid of the two and utilize these models to estimate the execution time for specified input parameters for simulations. In the experiments on real simulation data, our proposed models achieved about 73% accuracy on average in execution time estimation across 16 simulation programs taken from a variety of CSE fields.

10.1109/TIM.2020.3031835,Facial Expression Recognition Using Local Gravitational Force Descriptor-Based Deep Convolution Neural Networks,IEEE,Journals,"An image is worth a thousand words; hence, a face image illustrates extensive details about the specification, gender, age, and emotional states of mind. Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

Although it is an active area of research with an aim of improving a firm's success in its operations, a drawback of existing approaches is that they analyze it from only the perspective of events local to the supply chain. In this paper, we argue that it is also important for firms in a supply chain to consider external events as they will directly influence the internal ones and use various real-world examples of the risks in different processes of a supply chain as justification to prove our point. We then consider supply chain risk management not only as an operational research process, as do all the relevant survey papers, but a data science problem to gain deeper real-time insights for information risk management. Then, we suggest directions for future research that will assist supply chain risk managers to undertake better supply chain risk management processes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8654711/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

We present a method for producing visualizations of surfaces with uncertainties using points as display primitives. Our approach is to render the surface as a collection of points and to displace each point from its original location along the surface normal by an amount proportional to the uncertainty at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudocoloring to produce efficient and revealing visualizations. The basic approach is sufficiently flexible to allow natural extensions; we show incorporation of expressive modulation of opacity, change of the stroke primitive, and addition of an underlying polygonal model.

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new method for the segmentation of various types of factories based on their electricity consumption patterns represented in load profile data. It exploits the evolution-based characteristics of smart meter data of multiple types of factories to remove irrelevant features. We use data visualization to estimate the number of clusters and apply the well-known k-means algorithm on filtered data to generate segmentation.

However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7365411/,IEEE Access,2015,ieeexplore

However, predicting the execution times of e-Science workflows in heterogeneous distributed systems is a challenging job due to the complex structure of workflows, variations due to input problem-sizes, and heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the shared resources. To this end, we propose two novel workflow execution time-prediction methods based on the machine learning ensemble models. In this paper, we showcase our approach for two different real Grid environments. Our approach can effectively predict the execution time of the scientific workflow applications in the Grid for various problem sizes, Grid sites, and runtime environments. We characterized the workflow performance in the Grid using the attributes that define structure of workflow as well as the execution environment. Contrary to common ensembles, our ensemble systems employed three strong learners, which balance the weaknesses of each other by their strengths to model the workflow execution times. The proposed methods have been thoroughly evaluated for three real-world e-science workflow applications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed multi-model ensemble models can significantly decrease the prediction error (by 50%, on average) as compared with methods based on the radial basis function neural network, local learning, and performance templates.

10.1109/JBHI.2020.3037366,"An FSCV Deep Neural Network: Development, Pruning, and Acceleration on an FPGA",IEEE,Journals,"Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is an electrochemical technique for measuring rapid changes in the extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters within the brain. Due to its fast scan rate and large output-data size, the current analysis of the FSCV data is often conducted on a computer external to the FSCV device. Moreover, the analysis is semi-automated and requires a good understanding of the characteristics of the underlying chemistry to interpret, making it unsuitable for real-time implementation on low-resource FSCV devices. This paper presents a hardware-software co-design approach for the analysis of FSCV data. Firstly, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to predict the concentration of a dopamine solution and identify the data recording electrode. Secondly, the DNN is pruned to decrease its computation complexity, and a custom overlay is developed to implement the pruned DNN on a low-resource FPGA-based platform. The pruned DNN attains a recognition accuracy of 97.2% with a compression ratio of 3.18. When the DNN overlay is implemented on a PYNQ-Z2 platform, it achieves the execution time of 13 ms and power consumption of 1.479 W on the entire PYNQ-Z2 board.

10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966447,A software-equivalent SNN hardware using RRAM-array for asynchronous real-time learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Spiking Neural Network (SNN) naturally inspires hardware implementation as it is based on biology. For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges. First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short voltage-spikes which is disturbed by large voltage-waveforms that are simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real-time learning i.e. the simultaneous read-write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware. Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in real-time, asynchronously - avoiding non-biomimetic clocking based complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit-simulator) with MATLAB<sup>®</sup> (mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an example, the hardware shows 97.5% accuracy in classification which is equivalent to software for a Fisher's Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO<sub>2</sub> memristor. We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the hardware performance (85%), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM characteristics specifically for SNN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966447/,2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

Then, two embryonic communities and an undecided node set are generated through performing diffusing operation on such two points. Subsequently, an experience rule is used to classify the undecided nodes to form the final community structure.

The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer is a novel high performance computing platform, which is ranked No. 1 among the TOP500 list in the world. In this paper, we focus on how to optimize the Portable and Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc), running on supercomputers. The main motivations for this study are twofold: (i) PETSc is widely and frequently used in many scientific research fields such as biology, fusion, artificial intelligence, geosciences, etc; and (ii) the current nuclear PETSc does not fully utilize the potential of the Sunway TaighLight system, especially its powerful processor, i.e., SW26010 processor. To achieve high efficiency of PETSc, the central idea of our optimizations is to fully promote the performance of time-consuming and frequently used computation components (e.g., matrix and vector modules). To this end, we propose (i) accelerating kernel codes with computing processing elements (CPEs), in which new compression format and targeted optimizations for vector and matrix operations are devised; and (ii) using more efficient memory access schemes. We have implemented our proposals and evaluated its effectiveness and efficiency through a real world application - Structural Finite Element Analysis (SFEA).

While solutions based on signal processing and machine learning are extant, they are limited in various combinations of speed, computational complexity, and memory use, as well as in detection/classification capability in real-world conditions. This paper introduces ToucaNet, a deep neural network for birdsong detection based on transfer-learning, a deep learning mechanism allowing us to exploit knowledge acquired on various tasks: this enables us to speed up training and shows improved detection accuracy.

Conventionally, a protein consists of a number of structural domains and performs multiple function. By representing proteins, domains and functions by bags as well as instances and classes respectively, we are able to model the protein function prediction task as the Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) learning problem. Existing MIML algorithms mainly focus on batch setting where training examples are available before learning. Such offline paradigm works well in simulation, but it may be not feasible for real-world online applications where data comes one by one or chunk by chunk. In this paper, we investigate the protein function prediction problem under a new learning framework, called Online Multi-Instance Multi-Label (OMIML) learning, where MIML protein examples arrive sequentially in an online setting, and develop two OMIML algorithms (OMIML-I and OMIML-B) to make predictions for the incoming data. In the proposed OMIML algorithms, variable-length features are constructed to represent the MIML protein examples based on an incremental vocabulary mechanism. In particular, the incremental vocabularies that OMIML-I and OMIML-B are based on consist of instances and bags, respectively. Then we seek an online prediction for each new arrived protein example by incorporating the constructed features into an online multi-label learning algorithm which is constructed by introducing an artificial label into an online multi-label ranking model.

10.1109/AITEST49225.2020.00019,Test-Driven Anonymization in Health Data: A Case Study on Assistive Reproduction,IEEE,Conferences,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field whose prevalence in the health sector has increased during recent years. Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements. The results show that TDA can be successfully applied to anonymize the clinical data of the INEBIR, allowing third parties to transfer without transgressing user privacy and develop useful AI Tools with the anonymized data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176766/,2020 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),3-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

This important equipment needs to be understood and mastered through biological experiments. However, in actual experimental teaching in China, microscope samples are difficult to produce, preserve and share, and the implementation status is not ideal. These conditions seriously affect student enthusiasm and require additional participant labor. Moreover, they hinder teachers' evaluation of experimental learning. Thus, this paper constructs a smart microscope physical interaction kit for secondary school biology experiments. First, the main components of the traditional microscope are replaced by a variety of different sensing elements, which are 3D printed. Then, a novel multichannel information integration strategy based on visual, auditory and tactile information is proposed to manage different channels of information, to understand the user's operational intent and to organize reasonable interactions (including the display of real-time adjustment effects). Then, we propose a navigational interaction paradigm based on multimodal intent understanding, aiming at reminding users of invalid behavior and providing necessary operational guidance for users, thus achieving the purpose of intelligent interaction and intelligent experimental teaching. The experimental results show that the proposed microscope kit, multichannel integration strategy and navigation interaction algorithm not only imbue microscopy experiments with the characteristics of intelligent interaction but also stimulate student enthusiasm and help the evaluation of experimental learning.

A young barn owl can adapt to imposed environmental changes, such as artificial visual distortion caused by wearing a prism. This adjustment process has been modeled mathematically and the model replicates the sensory map realignment of barn owl superior colliculus (SC) through axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. This allows the biological mechanism to be transferred to an artificial computing system and thereby imbue it with a new form of adaptability to the environment. The model is demonstrated in a real-time robot environment. Results of the experiments are compared with and without prism distortion of vision, and show improved adaptability for the robot. However, the computation speed of the embedded system in the robot is slow.

Thus, numerous studies have been conducted to utilize HS in real-world optimization problems, and many variants and hybrid algorithms of HS have been developed to cope with different problems.

10.1109/TKDE.2018.2822307,Ensemble Learning for Multi-Type Classification in Heterogeneous Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Heterogeneous networks are networks consisting of different types of objects and links. They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship. More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks. However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation. Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation). In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification. We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network. As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training. Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC. Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329517/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

Specialized computers may be needed to execute an algorithm, and may fail to produce a solution, due to its large resource needs. The biclusters also include too many false positives, the type I error, which hinders biological discovery. We propose an algorithm that can analyze datasets with a large attribute set at different densities, and can operate on a laptop, which makes it accessible to practitioners. EMFP produces biclusters that have a very low Root Mean Squared Error and false positive rate, with very few type II errors. Our binary biclustering algorithm is a hybrid, axis-parallel, pattern-based algorithm that finds multiple, non-overlapping, near-constant, deterministic, binary submatricies, with a variable confidence threshold, and the novel use of local density comparisons versus the standard global threshold.

In this paper, we develop a novel fuzzy multiple kernel learning model based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) for classification, which we call HSIC-FMKL. In this model, we first propose an HSIC Lasso-based MKL formulation, which not only has a clear statistical interpretation that minimum redundant kernels with maximum dependence on output labels are found and combined, but also enables the global optimal solution to be computed efficiently by solving a Lasso optimization problem. Since the traditional support vector machine (SVM) is sensitive to outliers or noises in the dataset, fuzzy SVM (FSVM) is used to select the prediction hypothesis once the optimal kernel has been obtained. The main advantage of FSVM is that we can associate a fuzzy membership with each data point such that these data points can have different effects on the training of the learning machine. We propose a new fuzzy membership function using a heuristic strategy based on the HSIC. The proposed HSIC-FMKL is a two-stage kernel learning approach and the HSIC is applied in both stages.

The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8440124/,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,Jan. 2019,ieeexplore

Nearly 3275 sq.km of area spread over the Ratnapura District, seems to be highly prone to landslides and mass wastage of 2178 sq.km. Landslides occur in many regions of Ratnapura district and nearly 90 deaths have been reported according to National Research Building Organization (NBRO) in 2017. Most landslides or potential failures could be predicted fairly accurately if proper investigations were performed in time.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997921,A Physics-Based Neural-Network Way to Perform Seismic Full Waveform Inversion,IEEE,Journals,"Seismic full waveform inversion is a common technique that is used in the investigation of subsurface geology. Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9102272/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Due to its wide range of applications, team formation in SNs has been studied extensively and a number of approaches have been proposed. However, all of these proposals either build teams of individuals to accomplish jobs through a centralized manner or ignore the selfish nature of social individuals, or both. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized negotiation-based team formation model for non-cooperative SNs, where social individuals are self-interested. The proposed team formation model works by allowing the employer (i.e., Job initiator) to recruit a team of professional employees that demand small working remuneration and incur little communication overhead and allowing the employees to join the beneficial teams from which they can achieve a high financial remuneration.

As a result, fake news has become one of the main concerns because it could destabilize governments and put them at risk for contemporary society. This can be seen in the example, consider the United States. Electoral campaign, where the term “fake news” became famous as a result of the hoaxes impact on the final outcome. This research work studies the possibility of using deep learning techniques to discriminate against counterfeit news on the Internet using only their text. To do so, three different neural network architectures are suggested, one on the basis of BERT, Google's modern linguistic model that achieves cutting-edge results. In this project are the applications for the detection of `fake news,' which is misleading news stories from reputable sources of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods. This approach has been implemented and examined in the form of a software system. Can you build a prototype that can differentiate between “real” and “fake” news?

It is transformed into a machine learning problem of short text classification. We employ deep neural networks to classify microblogs into traffic relevant and traffic irrelevant ones. More specifically, we firstly adopt the continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) model to learn word embedding representations based on the dataset of three billion unlabeled microblogs. Next we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the abstract features of traffic relevant and traffic irrelevant microblogs.

It is defined to help members to select to whom interact based on collective information regarding real interactions with any user. In this way, we provide a tool intended to build trust among members of a sharing economy community given that is a major drawback from online transactions. As a workbench to run the linguistic decision making model, a web site and a mobile application for iOS and Android offer access to a carpooling service named Teranga Go! that seek to foster the mobility of international migration flows from Europe to Africa, based on concepts of collaborative economy and participatory consumption. The novelty of the site is the possibility of using hesitant linguistic expressions to assess a set of qualitative criteria and the use of the community members as the pool of experts. Unlike many multi criteria decision making problems we do not rank alternatives, we just qualify them using the retrieved opinions, which target a given user, and are collected over any interaction with this person along the time.

There are several methods for the detection and analysis of these attacks, among the most used are those based on machine learning. However, these methods suffer from a lack of precision in detecting phishing attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to propose new methods to improve the predictions of these attacks. In this article, we propone a three (03) step approach for the detection and analysis of phishing on Twitter, which can be applied to several other social networks. The first step is to browse a database called “Blacklist” in search of the suspicious URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Subsequently, we proceed to URL (Uniform Resource Locator) analysis leveraging machine learning techniques introducing new features. In this step the three following classifiers were used namely, Regression Logistics, SVM (Support vector Machine) and Random Forest.

At the same time, we know that misinformation is easily detectable by a certain few, very skeptical, or very informed users. In this study, we demonstrate how blending artificial intelligence and human skills can create a new paradigm for credibility prediction. The crowdsourcing part of the detection mechanism is implemented implicitly, by simply observing the natural interaction between users encountering the messages. Specifically, we explore the spread of information on Twitter at the microscopic (user-to-user propagation) level and propose a model that predicts if a message is True or False by observing the latent attributes of the message, along with those of the users interacting with it, and their reactions to the message. We demonstrate the application of this model to the detection of misinformation and rank the relevant message and user features that are most critical in influencing the spread of rumor over the network. Our experiments using real-world data show that the proposed model achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting the credibility of posts on Twitter, a significant boost over state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381339/,2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),7-10 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

There are lots of research to detect malware to protect mobile devices, but most of them adopt only signature-based malware detection method that can be easily bypassed by polymorphic and metamorphic malware. To detect malware and its variants, it is essential to adopt behavior-based detection for efficient malware classification. This paper presents a system that classifies malware by using common behavioral characteristics along with malware families. We measure the similarity between malware families with carefully chosen features commonly appeared in the same family. With the proposed similarity measure, we can classify malware by malware's attack behavior pattern and tactical characteristics. Also, we apply community detection algorithm to increase the modularity within each malware family network aggregation. To maintain high classification accuracy, we propose a process to derive the optimal weights of the selected features in the proposed similarity measure. During this process, we find out which features are significant for representing the similarity between malware samples. Finally, we provide an intuitive graph visualization of malware samples which is helpful to understand the distribution and likeness of the malware networks.

The existing studies have successfully explored user-item interaction via GCN for recommendation task and proved its effectiveness. We argue that a significant limitation of these methods is that social relation, which has been proven to impose positive effects for recommendation in many loss optimization models, has received relatively little scrutiny in GCN. Thus, the resultant embeddings are insufficient to model the potential social propagation effect. In our work, we propose to obtain embeddings by using the neighborhood propagation mechanism on two coupled graph neural networks, i.e., user-item interaction graph and social relation graph, which is capable of capturing the interplay between the item taste of user and user connection. In particular, to address the challenge that different factors on neighborhood propagation process make different contributions for the embedding, we develop a new social recommendation framework with hierarchical attention(i.e., neighbor-level and graph-level attention) Attentional Social Recommendation system (ASR). This allows much flexibility for adaptively acquiring relative importance for different factors.

Among all the security threats facing OSN, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental.

Unlike traditional bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this paper proposes a detection method called BotFlowMon that relies only on NetFlow data as input to identify OSN bot traffic, where every NetFlow record is a summary of a traffic flow on the Internet and contains no payload content. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to help use machine learning to classify the social bot traffic from the real OSN user traffic, including aggregating NetFlow records to obtain transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, as well as subdividing transactions into basic actions.

This paper presents a noble framework of augmenting machine learning techniques to agent-based models for better calibration and validation. The framework identifies periods of deviation between the simulation and the observation with hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov Model, or HDP-HMM, and the framework automatically calibrates the temporal macro parameters by searching parameter spaces with more likelihoods of validation.

The content information of events plays an important role in event recommendation. However, the content-based approaches in existing event recommender systems cannot fully represent the preference of each user on events since most of them focus on exploiting the content information from events' perspective, and the bag-of-words model, commonly used by them, can only capture word frequency but ignore word orders and sentence structure. In this paper, we shift the focus from events' perspective to users' perspective, and propose a Deep User Modeling framework for Event Recommendation (DUMER) to characterize the preference of users by exploiting the contextual information of events that users have attended. Specifically, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) with word embedding to deeply capture the contextual information of a user's interested events and build up a user latent model for each user.

A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, antilockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information.

Therefore, the search of such power agent can be validated through a machine learning approach that enables us to discover the agent dynamics in which drives the evolution of the social groups in a community. By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilistic model for the agent dynamics: the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters.

10.1109/ISMAR.2018.00039,Does a Digital Assistant Need a Body? The Influence of Visual Embodiment and Social Behavior on the Perception of Intelligent Virtual Agents in AR,IEEE,Conferences,"Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are becoming part of our everyday life, thanks to artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things devices. For example, users can control their connected home appliances through natural voice commands to the IVA. However, most current-state commercial IVAs, such as Amazon Alexa, mainly focus on voice commands and voice feedback, and lack the ability to provide non-verbal cues which are an important part of social interaction. Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to overcome this challenge by providing a visual embodiment of the IVA. In this paper we investigate how visual embodiment and social behaviors influence the perception of the IVA. We hypothesize that a user's confidence in an IVA's ability to perform tasks is improved when imbuing the agent with a human body and social behaviors compared to the agent solely depending on voice feedback. In other words, an agent's embodied gesture and locomotion behavior exhibiting awareness of the surrounding real world or exerting influence over the environment can improve the perceived social presence with and confidence in the agent. We present a human-subject study, in which we evaluated the hypothesis and compared different forms of IVAs with speech, gesturing, and locomotion behaviors in an interactive AR scenario. The results show support for the hypothesis with measures of confidence, trust, and social presence. We discuss implications for future developments in the field of IVAs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8613756/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR),16-20 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

This paper presents an emotion-based social computing platform namely ESC for streaming big-data. The main aim of ESC is to provide sentiment analysis as the foundation of social computing and enable both real-time computation on streaming big-data and batch computation on off-line big-data with high performance and low risk. Different from conventional data processing technologies, ESC is designed as a scalable and QoS-optimized adaptive platform for developers to only focus on business models instead of being distracted by details of the computing infrastructure. In addition, continuous streaming computing is emphasized in ESC to keep tracking on long term dynamic evolution in social media, which can provide a valuable proxy for in-depth social analytics. The architecture of ESC is implemented by distributed storage, sentiment analysis, data parallelism and routing, real-time streaming computation, batch computation and distributed machine learning.

In principle, the detection process seeks to simultaneously maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize the clustering drift between two successive time steps. Several evolutionary clustering methods have been developed in an attempt to find the best trade-off between clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, but the classic genetic operators in these methods do not make the best of the inter- and intra-connected relationships between nodes, which limits their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel migration operator to work in tandem with classic genetic operators to improve the discovery of evolving community structures. The operator is implemented within an existing genetic algorithm which relies on a genome representation under a decomposition framework that formulates evolutionary community detection as a multiobjective optimization problem. Moreover, we present a new method of calculating modularity directly from a genome matrix as the objective for measuring the snapshot quality, which results in a wider search space for finding the optimal solution. Experimental results over several synthetic networks and one real-world dynamic social network suggest that our method is superior to two other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and smoothness in discovering evolving community structures in dynamic social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8852006/,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 July 2019,ieeexplore

Therefore, traditional approaches cannot effectively achieve online detection of the ""drifting"" social spam with a fixed statistic feature set.

Many of the challenges and ongoing (r)evolutions appear to produce as yet seemingly contradictory requirements and thus produce potentially very interesting research areas. We argue that linguistics, community-based real world “social” semantics and pragmatics, scalability, the tri-sortal nature of the communities involved, the balance between usability and reusability, and the methodological requirements for non-disruptive adoption by enterprises of the new technologies provide vectors for fundamental computer science research, for interesting new artefacts, and for new valorisations of enterprise interoperability.

Because this data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way at scale, social media has been adopted as a “passive sensor” to study human behavior. However, such research is impacted by the lack of homogeneity in the use of social media, and the engineering challenges in obtaining such data. This paper proposes a statistical framework to leverage the potential of social media in sensing studies of human behavior, while navigating the challenges associated with its sparsity. Our framework is situated in a large-scale in-situ study concerning the passive assessment of psychological constructs of 757 information workers wherein of four sensing streams was deployed - bluetooth beacons, wearable, smartphone, and social media. Our framework includes principled feature transformation and machine learning models that predict latent social media features from the other passive sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this imputation framework via a high correlation of 0.78 between actual and imputed social media features. With the imputed features we test and validate predictions on psychological constructs like personality traits and affect. We find that adding the social media data streams, in their imputed form, improves the prediction of these measures.

For the purpose of human-robot interaction, the robot should have the ability to perform a variety of actions including face recognition, path planning, etc. In this paper, face recognition has been implemented on the Sanbot robot. Since the Sanbot robot is intended to work in real environment, therefore indoor and outdoor environment is taken into account in proposing the corresponding face recognition algorithm. For each case a robust pre-processing algorithm should be designed and which can circumvent a challenging problem in face recognition, namely, different lighting conditions (light intensity, angle of radiation, etc.). In case of indoor environment, faces in an captured image by the robot HD camera are found using a Haar-cascade algorithm. Afterwards, a histogram equalization is applied to face images in order to standardize them. Then commonly practiced Deep convolutional neural network structures such as Inception and ResNet are used to design a model and trained end-to-end on a customized dataset with strong augmentation. Finally, by using a voting method, proper prediction is carried out on each face. In what concerns the outdoor environment, which has more challenges, upon applying histogram Equalization on the captured image, faces are found using a MultiTask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network. Then face images are aligned as head orientation are corrected. Finally, cropped face image is fed to Siamese Network in order to extract face features and verifying individuals. From several practical results it has been inferred that the accuracy of the indoor method is nearly 93% without voting and with voting 97%, and the outdoor method is about 95%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9260698/,2020 28th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE),4-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

The industry requires a real time method for the timely processing of the extensive number of applicants for short-term small loans. Owing to the vast number of applications, manual verification is not a viable option. In cooperation with a microloan company in Azerbaijan, we have researched automated risk assessment using crowdsourcing. The principal concept behind this approach is the fact that a significant amount of information relating to a particular applicant can be retrieved from the social networks. The suggested approach can be divided into three parts: First, applicant information is collected on social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook. This can only occur with the applicant's permission. Then, this data is processed using a program that extracts the relevant information segments. Finally, these information segments are evaluated using crowdsourcing. We attempted to evaluate the information segments using social networks. To that end, we automatically posted requests on the social networks regarding certain information segments and evaluated the community response by counting “likes” and “shares”. For example, we posted the status, “Do you think that a person who has worked at ABC Company is more likely to repay a loan? Please “like” this post if you agree.” From the results, we were able to estimate public opinion. Once evaluated, each information segment was then given a weight factor that was optimized using available loan-repay test data provided to us by a company. We then tested the proposed system on a set of 400 applicants. Using a second crowdsourcing approach, we were able to confirm that the resulting solution provided a 92.5% correct assessment, with 6.45% false positives and 11.11% false negatives, with an assessment duration of 24 hours.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6888682/,"15th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)",30 June-2 July 2014,ieeexplore

The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet. When applied to predict the vulnerabilities exploitation and analyzed the real-world social media discussion data, it showed promising prediction accuracy with purified social media intelligence. Moreover, the AI-enabling modules have been deployed into a threat intelligence platform for further applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343128/,"2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)",29 Dec.-1 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/SMARTCOMP50058.2020.00051,Multi-modal Adversarial Training for Crisis-related Data Classification on Social Media,IEEE,Conferences,"Social media platforms such as Twitter are increasingly used to collect data of all kinds. During natural disasters, users may post text and image data on social media platforms to report information about infrastructure damage, injured people, cautions and warnings. Effective processing and analysing tweets in real time can help city organisations gain situational awareness of the affected citizens and take timely operations. With the advances in deep learning techniques, recent studies have significantly improved the performance in classifying crisis-related tweets. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human, but can lead to model's misclassification. To process multi-modal data as well as improve the robustness of deep learning models, we propose a multi-modal adversarial training method for crisis-related tweets classification in this paper. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in improving the robustness of tweet classification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239612/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),14-17 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

Over the past few decades, most existing work on cyberbullying has focused on text analysis. Yet, the cyberbullying develops into multi-objective, multi-channel, and multi-form. Traditional text analysis methods cannot satisfy the diversity of bullying data in social networks. To deal with the new type of cyberbullying, we propose a multi-modal detection framework that takes into multi-modal information(e.g., image, video, comments, time) on social networks. Specifically, we not only extract textual features but also use the hierarchical attention networks to capture the session feature in social networks and encode several media information(e.g., video, image). Based on these features, we model the multi-modal cyberbullying detection framework to solve the new form of cyberbullying. Experimental analysis on two real-world datasets shows that our framework outperforms several existing state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9206663/,2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),19-24 July 2020,ieeexplore

Emergency response is one such area that stands to gain from these advances. By processing billions of texts and images a minute, events can be automatically detected to enable emergency response workers to better assess rapidly evolving situations and deploy resources accordingly. To date, most event detection techniques in this area have focused on image-only or text-only approaches, limiting detection performance and impacting the quality of information delivered to crisis response teams. In this paper, we present a new multimodal fusion method that leverages both images and texts as input. In particular, we introduce a cross-attention module that can filter uninformative and misleading components from weak modalities on a sample by sample basis. In addition, we employ a multimodal graph-based approach to stochastically transition between embeddings of different multimodal pairs during training to better regularize the learning process as well as dealing with limited training data by constructing new matched pairs from different samples.

Although the acknowledgment that social learning is related to travel decision is promoted, quantitative analysis about how social learning shape and impact the decision of passengers is still limited. We study and estimate a diffusion probability between different passengers by proposing a CCM (Co-travel Link Cascade Model) based on a modified EM iterative algorithm. Then, we segment passengers into three types (Influenced, Unchecked and Immune). The three types of passengers are predicated by approaches of IC-like model, Random Forest model and probabilistic model, respectively.

Whilst artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing to produce more concise and interesting crowd behaviours, the number or sophistication of the algorithms implemented within a system does not necessarily guarantee its perceptual realism. Human perception is highly subjective and does not always conform to the reality of the situation. Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic.

The existing Ad Hoc routing protocols assume that there is at least one complete communication path between the source node and the target node. So they cannot be applied to MSN directly. The key to solve the problem of content distribution in mobile social network is how to transmit the data to the target node in the case of there is no complete communication path between the source node and the target node. As the routing algorithm based on ant colony optimization has great ability to adapt it, it is an effective method to deal with the dynamic topologies of MSN. Based on the social network characteristics of MSN, this paper proposes a new MSN routing algorithm ACOMSN based on ant colony optimization. The algorithm uses the method of processing the node information on the transmission path to get the information list between the node pairs, so as to select the appropriate relay node to provide effective information when forwarding data to other nodes.

In ST-PKMS, each vehicle has multiple short-lived anonymous public-keys, which are recorded on the blockchain platform. However, public-keys get activated only when a notary system notarizes it, and clients accept only notarized public-keys during mutual authentication. Compromised vehicles can be effectively removed from the VSNs by blocking notarization of their public-keys; thus, the need to distribute Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is eliminated in the proposed scheme. ST-PKMS ensures transparency, security, privacy, and availability, even in the face of an active adversary. The simulation and evaluation results show that the ST-PKMS meets real-time performance requirements, and it is cost-effective in terms of scalability, delay, and communication overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9345086/,2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),11-14 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ASONAM.2012.66,Semi-Supervised Policy Recommendation for Online Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Fine grain policy settings in social network sites is becoming a very important requirement for managing user's privacy. Incorrect privacy policy settings can easily lead to leaks in private and personal information. At the same time, being too restrictive would reduce the benefits of online social networks. This is further complicated with the growing adoption of social networks and with the rapid growth in information uploading and sharing. The problem of facilitating policy settings has attracted numerous access control, and human computer interaction researchers. The solutions proposed range from usable interfaces for policy settings to automated policy settings. We propose a fine grained policy recommendation system that is based on an iterative semi-supervised learning approach that uses the social graph propagation properties. Active learning and social graph properties were used to detect the most informative instances to be labeled as training sets. We implemented and tested our approach using real Facebook dataset. We compared our proposed approach to supervised learning and random walk approaches.

In this work, we aim to tackle social event detection from these large amounts of image collections by devising a semi-supervised multimodal clustering algorithm, denoted by SSMC, which exploits label signals to guide the fusion of the multimodal features. Particularly, SSMC takes advantage of the distribution over the similarities on a small amount of labeled data to represent the images, fusing multiple heterogeneous features seamlessly. As a result, SSMC has low computational complexity in processing multimodal features for both initial and updating stages.

Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets.

10.1109/IACC.2016.111,Sybil Detection in Online Social Networks (OSNs),IEEE,Conferences,"Peer to peer and distributed systems are generally susceptible to sybil attacks. Online social networks (OSNs), due to their fat user base and open access nature are also prone to such attacks. Current state-of-art algorithms for sybil attack detection make use of the inherent social graph created among registered users of OSN service. They rely on the inherent trust relationship among these users. No effort is made to combine other characteristic behavior of sybil users with properties of social graph of OSNs to improve detection accuracy of sybil attacks. Sybil identities are also used as gateways for spreading spam content in OSNs. The proposed approach exploits this behavior of sybil users to improve detection accuracy of existing sybil detection algorithms. In the proposed approach, content generated/published by each user is used along with the topological properties of the social graph of registered users. A machine learning model is used for assigning a fractional value called ""trust value"" which denotes the amount of legitimate content generated by the user. A modification to sybil detection algorithm is proposed which makes use of the trust value of each user to improve the accuracy of detecting a sybil identity. Real dataset from Facebook is crawled and used for analysis and experiments. Analytical results show the superiority of proposed solution. Results are compared with SybilGuard and SybilShield which shows ~14% decrease in false positive rates with very minimal effect on acceptance rate or false negative rate of the sybil detection algorithms.

10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057066,SybilSCAR: Sybil detection in online social networks via local rule based propagation,IEEE,Conferences,"Detecting Sybils in online social networks (OSNs) is a fundamental security research problem as adversaries can leverage Sybils to perform various malicious activities. Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into two categories: Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and they cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a new structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in OSNs. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with a state-of-the-art RW-based method and a state-of-the-art LBP-based method, using both synthetic Sybils and large-scale social network datasets with real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that SybilSCAR is more accurate and more robust to label noise than the compared state-of-the-art RW-based method, and that SybilSCAR is orders of magnitude more scalable than the state-of-the-art LBP-based method and is guaranteed to converge.

10.1109/ICTAI.2017.00035,Using Deep Learning for Community Discovery in Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Community detection is an important task in social network analysis. Existing methods typically use the topological information alone, and ignore the rich information available in the content data. Recently, some researchers have noticed that user profiles can also benefit to community detection, and hence the combination of topology and node contents has become a new hot topic. Some methods using both topology and content have been proposed. However, they often suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they cannot extract a potential deep representation of the network; 2) they cannot automatically weight different information sources with adequate balance parameters. To overcome these issues, we propose a deep integration representation (DIR) algorithm via deep joint reconstruction, which is motivated by the similarity between deep feedforward auto-encoders and spectral clustering in terms of matrix reconstruction. Thanks to spectral clustering which is one of the best community detection methods, the proposed new method is also good at community discovery task. In addition, DIR has further benefit because it not only provides a nonlinear and deep representation of the network, but also learns the most suitable balance between different components automatically.

Some bots are designed for marketers trying to sell products or attract users to new sites. Other types of bots are much more malicious and disseminate misinformation that harms or tricks users. Such bots (fake accounts) may lead to serious consequences, as people's social network has become one of the determining factors in their general decision making. Therefore, these accounts have the potential to influence people's opinions drastically and hence real life events as well. Through different machine learning techniques, researchers have now begun to investigate ways to detect these types of malicious accounts automatically. To successfully differentiate between real accounts and bot accounts, a comprehensive analysis of the behavioral patterns of both types of accounts is required. In this paper, we investigate ways to select the best features from a data set for automated classification of different types of social media accounts (ex. bot versus real account) via visualization.

10.1109/TAMD.2011.2112766,A Biologically Inspired Architecture for an Autonomous and Social Robot,IEEE,Journals,"Lately, lots of effort has been put into the construction of robots able to live among humans. This fact has favored the development of personal or social robots, which are expected to behave in a natural way. This implies that these robots could meet certain requirements, for example, to be able to decide their own actions (autonomy), to be able to make deliberative plans (reasoning), or to be able to have an emotional behavior in order to facilitate human-robot interaction. In this paper, the authors present a bioinspired control architecture for an autonomous and social robot, which tries to accomplish some of these features. In order to develop this new architecture, authors have used as a base a prior hybrid control architecture (AD) that is also biologically inspired. Nevertheless, in the later, the task to be accomplished at each moment is determined by a fix sequence processed by the Main Sequencer. Therefore, the main sequencer of the architecture coordinates the previously programmed sequence of skills that must be executed. In the new architecture, the main sequencer is substituted by a decision making system based on drives, motivations, emotions, and self-learning, which decides the proper action at every moment according to robot's state. Consequently, the robot improves its autonomy since the added decision making system will determine the goal and consequently the skills to be executed. A basic version of this new architecture has been implemented on a real robotic platform. Some experiments are shown at the end of the paper.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5711644/,IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development,Sept. 2011,ieeexplore

The system is context independent and can be applied to many on-going problems in social robotics, including but not limited to person recognition, emotion recognition, and multi-modal robot doctor to name a few. The system encapsulates the parallel distributed processing of real-world stimuli through different sensor modalities and encoding them into features vectors which in turn are processed via a number of dedicated processing units (DPUs) through hierarchical paths. DPUs are algorithmic realizations of the cell assemblies in neuroscience. A plausible and realistic perceptual system is presented via the integration of the outputs from these units by spiking neural networks. We will also discuss other components of the system including top-down influences and the integration of information through temporal binding with fading memory and suggest two alternatives to realize these criteria.

Many people have lost their jobs, relationships, and are stalked because of online privacy breaches. This situation is even more disturbing for young teens as they are in the process of learning emotional, social, and physical behaviors. Online predators take advantage of their immaturity and raise various threats to teens including aggression, rape, abduction, physical and emotional sadistic torture, and even human trafficking. Teens, on the other hand, do not have any mechanism to protect them against such threats. Therefore, this research addresses this overlooked need and proposes a trust model for the teen community, which can evaluate the trustworthiness of a stranger based on teens' psychological and social needs. This paper first identifies various factors of teen psychology from literature, and then proposes a trust model for teens based on those factors. The model ensures the trustworthiness of a stranger through a two-dimension matrix consists of his reputation in other teens and reliability. The proposed model was simulated through colored Petri nets and implemented as a real-time trust evaluation application over Facebook. A user acceptance testing was also performed by teens, which suggests that 81.77% of teens were overall satisfied with the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133402/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Malicious attackers can create massive Sybils and further utilize those fake identities to launch various Sybil attacks. Therefore, Sybil detection in OSNs has become an urgent security research problem for both academia and industries. The existing content-based methods to detect Sybils base on the combination of manual-design features and machine learning algorithms, which requires lots of professional experiences and human effort. These methods divide the Sybil detection problem into two piece-wise sub-problems, which prevents us from getting the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel content-based method to detect Sybils. The proposed method is an end-to-end classification model that extracts features directly from the input data, and then output the classification results in a unified framework. The proposed method includes three main parts: first, the self-normalizing convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to extract lower features from the multi-dimensional input data; second, the bidirectional self-normalizing LSTM network (bi-SN-LSTM) is developed to extract higher features from the compressed feature map sequence; third, the dense layer and softmax classifier are stacked to output the classification results. Unlike the traditional bidirectional long short-term memory network (bi-LSTM), the proposed bi-SN-LSTM network utilizes SELU as the activation function of its recurrent step, which provides unbounded changes to the state value.

Adversaries can easily obtain these data and launch continuous attacks to breach privacy. However, existing works only focus on either location privacy or identity privacy with a static adversary. This results in privacy leakage and possible further damage. Motivated by this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving scheme, which considers both location and identity privacy against a dynamic adversary. We study the privacy protection problem as the tradeoff between the users aiming at maximizing data utility with high-level privacy protection while adversaries possessing the opposite goal. We first establish a game-based Markov decision process model, in which the user and the adversary are regarded as two players in a dynamic multistage zero-sum game. To acquire the best strategy for users, we employ a modified state-action-reward-state-action reinforcement learning algorithm. Iteration times decrease because of cardinality reduction from n to 2, which accelerates the convergence process.

However, individuals are often exposed to a wide range of risks posed by malicious users who spread various fake information to achieve their vicious goals, which makes the concept of trust a vital issue. Most of the existing research attempts to construct a trust network among users, whereas only a few studies pay attention to analyzing their features. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation framework based on machine learning to facilitate human decision making by extensively considering multiple trust-related user features and criteria. We first divide user features into four groups according to the empirical analysis, including profile-based features, behavior-based features, feedback-based features, and link-based features. Then, we design a lightweight feature selection approach to evaluate the effectiveness of every single feature and find out the optimal combination of features from users' online records. We formalize trust analysis as a classification problem to simplify the verification process. We compare the performance of our features with four other feature sets proposed in the existing research. Moreover, four traditional trust evaluation methods are employed to compare with our machine learning based methods.

Since the number and size of the networks modeled by graphs grow larger and larger, some level of parallelism needs to be used, to reduce the computational costs of such massive applications. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (referred to as lists on Facebook and Twitter), while users, based on their interests, place themselves into groups of interest. However, the community detection and is a very effortful procedure, and in addition, these communities need to be updated very often, resulting in more effort. In this paper, we combine parallel processing techniques with a typical data structure like threaded binary trees to detect communities in an efficient manner. Our strategy is implemented over weighted networks with irregular topologies and it is based on a stepwise path detection strategy, where each step finds a link that increases the overall strength of the path being detected.

For example, in the field of open-source software development, most software developments require multiple developers to collaborate with each other. With the increase in the number and variety of social-collaboration tasks, it is difficult for individuals to discover social-collaboration tasks that they can participate. If we can help match the social-collaboration tasks with appropriate users, the quality and speed of these tasks will be improved, thus social organizations (e.g., companies, teams, and research institutions) and individuals can improve productivity, which is very significant. However, most related work in recommending individuals to participate in social-collaboration tasks mainly focus on individual's data features/characteristics (e.g., personal behaviors and attributes), and little work is based on the social collaborative data features/characteristics within the individual's participation in the social-collaboration tasks, such as the types of social-collaboration tasks that individuals participate, collaborative content, collaborative behavior, collaborative intensity, and so on. This paper proposes a universal recommendation method based on personal social-collaboration preferences, which is used to recommend the social-collaboration tasks that individuals can participate. The characteristics of social-collaboration data contain a large number of individuals' preferences for social-collaboration, which helps improve recommendation performance.

Several works try to learn a common subspace for networks by preserving the structural proximities, such that different contribution weights of neighbors are ignored as users were always connected by unweighted edges. In this paper, we propose an attention-based network embedding model that exploits the social structures for user alignment. In particular, two main components are contained in our model framework: a masked graph attention mechanism which tries to learn the alignment task driven attention weights by the supervision of pre-aligned user pairs, and an embedding algorithm tries to learn a common vector space by explicitly modeling the weighted contribution probabilities between follower-ships and followee-ships. With the learned weights and embeddings transferring between these two components, we construct a unified model for user embedding and alignment.

The automated annotation process can reduce users' cognitive overhead in tagging and improve tag management for better search, browsing, and recommendation of documents. It can be formulated as a multilabel classification problem. We propose a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels. The network separately models the title and the content of each document and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each sentence. To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption, which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics. The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN). We conducted a comprehensive evaluation study and compared JMAN to the state-of-the-art baseline models, using four large, real-world social media data sets. In terms of F<sub>1</sub>, JMAN significantly outperformed bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) relatively by around 12.8%-78.6% and the hierarchical attention network (HAN) by around 3.9%-23.8%.

For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests.

On the other hand, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a favorable way to locally process SIoT data for reducing data transmission and computation among SIoT devices and backhaul networks. Nevertheless, the load sharing among SIoT devices, MEC, and remote servers brings about new challenges for the communication and computation tradeoff, cross-layer design in SIoT, and forwarding and aggregation tradeoff. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, SIoT collaborative group and device selection problem (SCGDSP), and prove the NP-hardness. We first explore the intrinsic properties of a fundamental SCGDSP case by finding the optimal collaborative group for each user request. Then, we design an approximation algorithm for the general SCGDSP that first evaluates candidate collaborative groups under different social relations, and then selects the collaborative groups and SIoT devices properly. For scalability, the proposed algorithm also supports dynamic user requests and can be distributionally deployed in massive networks enabling collaborative MEC. Moreover, it also sustains local SIoT services, where the computation only involves SIoT devices and MEC servers. Simulation results demonstrate that effective SIoT and collaborative group selection (ESCGS) can reduce by more than 50% of the total communication and computation costs compared with baseline schemes in the real networks from topology zoo. Moreover, the distributed ESCGS reduces by 87% of the running time with total 16.5-MB message overhead, requiring no more than 0.05-ms transmission delay in a 100-Gb/s backbone network with eight MEC servers, 1000 SIoTs, and 800 monitored locations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9171854/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Existing approaches focus mainly on arrangement strategies that include users and events on an EBSN platform under an offline scenario, where all information is known in advance. However, these strategies ignore the importance of the organizer, and the offline scenarios can be impractical since all elements appear dynamically in reality. Therefore, we consider not only the user and event in the EBSN platform under the online scenario but also the importance of the organizer. In this paper, we study the complex dynamic event participant in an EBSN that considers three elements: users, events and organizers. We first formalize the event arrangement problem in the online scenario through event arrangement through three-dimensional matching (EATDM). Then, we propose a straightforward solution of the EATDM problem, a greedy algorithm with a competitive ratio, and further develop a basis solution, a random algorithm.

Spam detection methods can be broadly divided into expert-based and machine learning-based detection methods. When experts participate in spam detection, the detection accuracy is fairly high. However, this method is highly time-consuming and expensive. Conversely, methods using machine learning have the advantage of automation, but their accuracy is relatively low. This paper proposes a spam-detection framework that combines and fully exploits the advantages of both methods. To reduce the workload of the experts, all messages are first analyzed via a primary machine learning filter, and those that are determined to be normal messages are allowed through, whereas suspicious messages are flagged. The flagged messages are subsequently analyzed by an expert to enhance the overall system accuracy. In the filtering process, cost-based machine learning is used to prevent the fatal error of misidentifying a spam message as a normal message. In addition, to obviate the continuously evolving spam trends, a module that periodically updates the expert-diagnosis results on the training dataset is incorporated into the framework. The results of experiments conducted, on an imbalanced dataset of spam tweets and normal tweets in a ratio similar to the actual situation in real life, indicate that the proposed framework has a spam-detection rate of almost 92.8%, which is higher than that of the conventional machine learning technique. Furthermore, the proposed framework delivered stable high performance even in an environment where social network messages changed continuously, unlike the conventional technique, which exhibited large performance deviations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492082/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

The providers of OSNs typically leverage demographic attributes of users in OSNs to perform business behaviors like personalized commodity recommendation, advertisement delivery, etc. Thus, understanding demographic attributes of users in OSNs is of great importance. However, some users refuse to reveal their demographic information due to privacy concerns. Therefore, inferring demographic attributes of users in OSNs with public information is an attractive topic for researchers. Most existing methods mainly focus on individual attribute inference without taking the relationship among attributes into account, which results in low precisions.

Meanwhile, it encodes multiple attributes into structured attribute vectors which are treated as class labels. The core component of DeepAttr is a multi-layer fully connected deep neural network which captures complex nonlinear mapping between the users' social embeddings and the structured attribute vectors.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information.

Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy.

Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the OSS projects (e.g., bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, and so on) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on OSS projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: social network analysis, DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting overtime. DSNs over time are considered a small-world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55% diversity with 75% of evenness between the developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment. Moreover, DSNs over time have a few developers as core members and large developers as peripheral members. Finally, about 10% of developers changed their positions frequently over time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8454243/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

This paper contributes to addressing this challenge by introducing a new architectural solution to evaluate and manage the quality of social media data in each processing phase of the big data pipeline.

Unfortunately, the hidden information is likely to be predicted by various powerful inference attacks with the rapid advances in machine learning. Then, what is the risk that a user's private information could be disclosed? What countermeasures can be taken to fight against the privacy violation for the user? To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk. Extensive experiment studies on two real social network datasets, Facebook and Book-Crossing, have verified the effectiveness of F-PAD in `current city', `gender' and `age' disclosure risk estimation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8895669/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 Nov.-Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

In conventional GDM models, a group of experts express their individual preferences on a finite set of alternatives, then preferences are aggregated and the best alternative, satisfying the majority of experts, is selected. Nevertheless, in real situations, experts form their opinions in a complex interpersonal environment where preferences are liable to change due to social influence. In order to take into account the effects of social influence during the GDM process, we propose a new influence-guided GDM model based on the following assumptions: experts influence each other and the more an expert trusts in another expert, the more his opinion is influenced by that expert. The effects of social influence are especially relevant to cases when, due to domain complexity, limited expertise or pressure to make a decision, an expert is unable to express preferences on some alternatives, i.e., in presence of incomplete information. The proposed model adopts fuzzy rankings to collect both experts' preferences on available alternatives and trust statements on other experts. Starting from collected information, possibly incomplete, the configuration and the strengths of interpersonal influences are evaluated and represented through a social influence network (SIN). The SIN, in its turn, is used to estimate missing preferences and evolve them by simulating the effects of experts' interpersonal influence before aggregating them for the selection of the best alternative. The proposed model has been experimented with synthetic data to demonstrate the influence driven evolution of opinions and its convergence properties.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016383/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,June 2018,ieeexplore

On one hand, platforms such as Twitter have taken a central role in the dissemination and consumption of news. On the other hand, news editors rely on social media for following their audience's attention and for crowd-sourcing news stories. Twitter hashtags function as a key connection between Twitter crowds and the news media, by naturally naming and contextualizing stories, grouping the discussion of news and marking topic trends. In this work, we propose Hashtagger+, an efficient learning-to-rank framework for merging news and social streams in real-time, by recommending Twitter hashtags to news articles. We provide an extensive study of different approaches for streaming hashtag recommendation, and show that pointwise learning-to-rank is more effective than multi-class classification as well as more complex learning-to-rank approaches. We improve the efficiency and coverage of a state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation model by proposing new techniques for data collection and feature computation. In our comprehensive evaluation on real-data, we show that we drastically outperform the accuracy and efficiency of prior methods. Our prototype system delivers recommendations in under 1 minute, with a Precision@1 of 94 percent and article coverage of 80 percent. This is an order of magnitude faster than prior approaches, and brings improvements of 5 percent in precision and 20 percent in coverage. By effectively linking the news stream to the social stream via the recommended hashtags, we open the door to solving many challenging problems related to story detection and tracking.

In this context, secure transmission of data plays a critical role in realizing all of the key requirements of social multimedia networks such as reliability, scalability, quality of information, and quality of service (QoS). Thus, a trust-based paradigm for multimedia analytics is highly desired to meet the increasing user requirements and deliver more timely and actionable insights. In this regard, software-defined networks (SDNs) play a vital role; however, several factors such as as-runtime security, and energy-aware networking limit its capabilities to facilitate efficient network control and management. Thus, with the view to enhance the reliability of the SDN, a hybrid deep-learning-based anomaly detection scheme for suspicious flow detection in the context of social multimedia is proposed. It consists of the following two modules: (1) an anomaly detection module that leverages improved restricted Boltzmann machine and gradient descent-based support vector machine to detect the abnormal activities, and (2) an end-to-end data delivery module to satisfy strict QoS requirements of the SDN, that is, high bandwidth and low latency. Finally, the proposed scheme has been experimentally evaluated on both real-time and benchmark datasets to prove its effectiveness and efficiency in terms of anomaly detection and data delivery essential for social multimedia.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939403,Image Recommendation With Reciprocal Social Influence,IEEE,Journals,"Image recommendation plays an important role for exploring user potential interests in large-scale image sharing websites (e.g., Flickr and Instagram). Social relationships have been exploited to learn user preference, and shown their effectiveness. We argue that their performance improvement tends to be limited, as most existing approaches only consider the side of social influence from friends to a user. However, social influence is reciprocal per se as the preference of friends will be also influenced by the user herself. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for image recommendation (dubbed RSIM) by leveraging reciprocal social influence, and optimize the preferences of users and friends simultaneously. Specifically, we split images into three types: positive image by an active user, social image by her social friends, and negative image by neither of them. We contend that a user prefers positive image to social image, which is in turn better than negative image for relative preference learning. Two neural networks are designed to capture user and image representations by tags and visual features, respectively. The proposed model is evaluated on a real dataset crawled from Flickr.

In contrast to existing image tagging approaches that rely on high-quality image-tag supervision, we acquire weak supervision of our neighbor learning method by progressive neighborhood retrieval from noisy and diverse user-contributed image collections.

Given fixed number of seed users and certain diffusion models, the IM problem aims to select proper seed users in a social networks such that they can achieve the maximal spread of influence. Most previous work assumes that there are only positive relationships between users, and thus users spread influence positively. However, negative relationships also universally exist in various social networks and are complementary to positive relationships in information diffusion. In this paper, the influence maximization problem is addressed in signed social networks that contain both positive and negative relationships. We propose a novel diffusion model called LT-S and two influence spread functions. The proposed LT-S model extends the classical linear threshold model with opinion formation that incorporates both positive and negative opinions and simulates information diffusion in real-world social networks. The influence spread functions under the LT-S model are neither monotone nor submodular which bring challenges to maximization. The RLP algorithm is proposed to tackle the issue, which is improved from R-Greedy algorithm by incorporating two proposed accelerating techniques, the live-edge based and propagation-path based techniques.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979163,Joint Learning of Embedding-Based Parent Components and Information Diffusion for Social Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Diffusion on social networks refers to the phenomena that opinions are spread via connected nodes. Given a set of observed cascades, the underlying diffusion process can be inferred for social network analysis. Earlier studies for modeling the diffusion process often assume that the activation of a node depends independently on the activations of its neighbors (or called parent nodes). Nevertheless, the activation of a node also depends on the connectivity of its neighbors. For instance, the opinions from the neighbors of the same closely connected social group are often similar, and thus those neighbors exhibit similar influence. Some recent studies incorporate the structural dependency of neighbors as connected components, which allow more accurate diffusion models to be inferred. However, the effectiveness of such component-based models often depends on how the components are identified. Existing methods are not designed to directly preserve the local connectivity of neighbors. In this paper, we propose to incorporate network embedding to enhance the performance of component-based diffusion models in social networks. In particular, we embed nodes in a social network in a latent vector space with local connectivity of the nodes preserved. Parent component identification then becomes a clustering task in the embedding space. A united probabilistic framework is proposed so that the parent components and the component-based diffusion models can be inferred simultaneously using a two-level EM algorithm based on observed information cascades. For performance evaluation, we apply the proposed model to both synthetic and real world data sets with promising results obtained. The empirical results also show how the use of the embedding-based framework can enhance both the component identification and the diffusion model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9027935/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

This situation brings very dangerous problems in social networks. One of these problems is hate speech detection (HSD) problem which is covering issues such as insults, swearing, humiliation, discrimination, exclusion, detest, abhor, blast, damn, and intolerance. These can be reactions to a person, a group, an organization, an order, or an event. Although few machine learning methods have been used in the literature to solve this important problem in online social media, the performance of the HSD models in terms of many metrics needs to be increased. In this study, an automatic HSD system based on metaheuristic methodology was proposed for better results in this new and important problem. In the proposed optimization approach, Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm were designed for the HSD problem. This is the first attempt to use optimization algorithms as solution search strategies for automatic HSD. An efficient representation scheme and flexible fitness function were designed for this purpose. Many metrics can easily be embedded into the designed fitness function in order to be simultaneously optimized. Firstly, the basic natural language processing (NLP) steps were carried out. Feature extraction was performed using Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency (TF), and document vector (Word2Vec).

A specific problem that has recently spurred research interest is the so-called Social Circle Inference from Mobility data (SCIM), aiming at inferring relationships among users based on mobility data and without any explicit structured network information. The existing methods either require partial social ties or fail to model the implicit correlations between user links, thereby suffering from critical inference bias. We present a novel SCIM framework, called SCIM via self-Attention and Contextualized-embedding (SCIMAC) - a methodology capturing multiple aspects of users' check-in behavior and complex motion patterns of different users. Instead of directly applying the recurrent model on training user trajectories, the proposed method introduces a new module for context-aware check-in representation learning by adaptively incorporating the internal states of the recurrent layers, which is more effective than the context-independent check-in embedding used in existing social circle inference approaches. To model the underlying correlations between labels, SCIMAC leverages a more sophisticated label embedding technique to adjust the penalties for correlated users, enabling a better understanding of the user's hierarchy in the label space, and alleviating the inference bias.

Recent efforts sidestep this limitation through retrieving users' locations by alternatively unifying user generated contents (e.g., texts and public profiles) and online social relations. Though achieving some progress, previous methods rely on the similarity of texts and/or neighboring nodes for user geolocation, which suffers the problems of: (1) location-agnostic problem of network representation learning, which largely impedes the performance of their prediction accuracy; and (2) lack of interpretability w.r.t. the predicted results that is crucial for understanding model behavior and further improving prediction performance.

Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time. Learning-based prediction is attempted by training four classifiers: naïve Bayes, $k$ -nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine. Two independent set of experiments were conducted with oversights of bandwidth and destination prediction. Both the discrete and continuous valued predictors were involved in the training. Performance evaluation of the generated hypothesis in both the cases was conducted using tenfold cross validation. Combined analysis using the assorted combinations of attributes was conducted, and thereafter, the effect of each feature was evaluated through singular attribute portioning.

Unfortunately, most existing co-clustering methods that mainly focus on dealing with static data become infeasible to fuse huge volume of multi-modal data in dynamic CPSS environments. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a parameter-free incremental co-clustering method to deal with multi-modal data dynamically.

10.23919/JSC.2020.0005,Predicting Tie Strength of Chinese Guanxi by Using Big Data of Social Networks,TUP,Journals,"This paper poses a question: How many types of social relations can be categorized in the Chinese context? In social networks, the calculation of tie strength can better represent the degree of intimacy of the relationship between nodes, rather than just indicating whether the link exists or not. Previou research suggests that Granovetter measures tie strength so as to distinguish strong ties from weak ties, and the Dunbar circle theory may offer a plausible approach to calculating 5 types of relations according to interaction frequency via unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering interactive data between users in Facebook and Twitter). In this paper, we differentiate the layers of an ego-centered network by measuring the different dimensions of user's online interaction data based on the Dunbar circle theory. To label the types of Chinese guanxi, we conduct a survey to collect the ground truth from the real world and link this survey data to big data collected from a widely used social network platform in China. After repeating the Dunbar experiments, we modify our computing methods and indicators computed from big data in order to have a model best fit for the ground truth. At the same time, a comprehensive set of effective predictors are selected to have a dialogue with existing theories of tie strength. Eventually, by combining Guanxi theory with Dunbar circle studies, four types of guanxi are found to represent a four-layer model of a Chinese ego-centered network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241511/,Journal of Social Computing,September 2020,ieeexplore

By discovering process models and analyzing social network metrics created throughout the operation of the information system, we can better understand the roles of performers and characteristics of activities, and more easily predict what will occur in the next operation of a system. By using accurate and valuable predicted information, we can create effective environments, provide suitable materials to perform activities better, and facilitate more efficient operations. In this study, we apply the long short-term memory, a variant of the recurrent neural network, to predict the enterprise social networks that are formed through information regarding a business system's operation. More precisely, we apply the multivariate multi-step long short-term memory model to predict not only the next activity and next performer, but also all the variants of a process-aware enterprise social network based on the next performer predictions using a probability threshold. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental evaluation on the real-life event logs and compare our results with some related researches.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892949,Psychological Gender Express via Mobile Social Network Activities: An Experimental Study on a Gay Network Data,IEEE,Journals,"It is well known that the social network users' behavior can reflect their personal mental profiles. Therefore, in this paper, we conducted an experiment to study users' gender identity through a mobile social network. Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth, that is, one's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither. In general, a person's psychological gender cannot be observed from the external characteristics of people. And even if some user's attributes such as physical gender and age can be found in social networks, it is difficult to find out the psychological gender of users. Apart from the fact that it will be hidden as the user's privacy, the main reason is that users' behaviors in social networks have no direct relationship with psychological gender. In this paper, we choose a special mobile social network to get around these limitations. Specifically, this paper is based on a real-world large gay social network of more than 10 000 000 users. In this mobile social network, we can indirectly mark the psychological gender of users by their sexual orientation. We collect 1000 users, including their characters, followers, followees and the same data for their followers and followees. Then, we examine an extensive set of features that can be extracted from the data set and train some classifiers to automatically identify the user's psychological gender. In the special mobile social network, a user's psychological gender is related to his characteristics, which include his personal characteristics, dating preference, and so on. This paper mainly analyzes users' personal characteristics, triads, and triadic evolution to infer their psychological gender. The experiments show that all these features are indeed effective in the classification, and even the features considered in previous studies have different implications with gender identity on other social networks. And it turns out that psychological gender as a kind of privacy can be leaked by these unintentional behaviors, and so we give some practical suggestions at the end of this paper to protect users' privacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8611321/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Such a large number of heterogeneous IoT services produce huge amounts of data in almost real time, known as big data, many of which cannot be measured or quantified. Hence, a recommended system that aims to deal with the unquantifiable big data is urgently needed. To solve the problem, we propose a novel quantile contextual tree-based multiarmed bandits algorithm to support the large-scale recommendation with both quantifiable and unquantifiable data. Furthermore, the high failure rate of communication has a serious influence on the recommendation accuracy of our system with the widely used D2D technology in today's IoT network. To improve recommendation accuracy under the D2D communication, we take into account the feedback of historical service receivers and the historical successful delivery rate (SDP) of data transmission at the same time for the service recommendation system. We give theoretical analysis to prove a sublinear bound of the regret. Numerical experiments with tremendously large data sets show that we can balance the regret with the system time cost and guarantee a high SDP.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9032093/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,June 2020,ieeexplore

Its key components including adaptive sampling, adaptive budget allocation, dynamic grouping, perturbation and filtering, are seamlessly integrated as a whole to provide privacy-preserving statistics publishing on infinite time stamps.

Diverse kinds of trajectories from the sensor networks provide an unprecedented opportunity for intelligence analysis. The geographic co-movement pattern has rarely been used by the police force to infer social connections, although it has been prevalent in other fields. The previous studies have mainly focused on a singular form of trajectories with exact co-locations, and the spread of the co-locations is over-looked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting co-occurrence patterns over multiplex trajectories. Firstly, We constructed the foundation for the discovery of co-occurrence events, namely space-time resonance honeycomb. It consists of multiple polygonal zones over sensor networks. Secondly, we transform all trajectories into a series of space-time prisms, and co-location activities are recorded using a sliding window approach. Thirdly, we propose a novel feature: Geo-Spread, which captures the extent of the co-location spread. In the end, we combine multiple features and employ Random Forest to predict social connections. We conduct extensive experiments on both the public dataset and the real-world surveillance dataset.

As a typical type of social networks, how to evaluate scholar influence in the academic social network has been a practical issue for research institutions. In this paper, we aim at evaluating the latent influence of scholars to find academic rising stars, which refer to scholars that may have few papers and little impact currently, but he or she will become influential scholars in the future. Most of the current works focus on the assessment of rising stars. However, there exists a growth period for each scholar. It is unfair for young scholars with limited resources, who will make acquaintance at conferences and recommendations and who will learn from senior scholars. In this paper, we primarily propose StarRank, which is an improved PageRank method to calculate the initial values of rising stars, construct the social network via explicit and implicit links, and apply the neural network to predict scholars' rankings in the future.

The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm which combines the multimodel detections in mean-shift tracking. First, a likelihood probability which integrates detections and similarity to local appearance is defined. Then, an expectation-maximization (EM)-like mean-shift algorithm is derived under the ML framework. In each iteration, the E-step estimates the associations to the detections, and the M-step locates the new position according to the ML criterion. To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for multiperson tracking, an improved sequential strategy to perform the mean-shift tracking is proposed. Under this strategy, human objects are tracked sequentially according to their priority order. To balance the efficiency and robustness for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is selected. The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social robots. The vision system integrates stereo-based and histograms-of-oriented-gradients-based human detections, occlusion reasoning, and sequential mean-shift tracking. Various examples to show the advantages and robustness of the proposed system for multiperson tracking from mobile robots are presented. Quantitative evaluations on the performance of multiperson tracking are also performed.

Although the link prediction problem is not new, the challenge of how to exploit various existing network information, such as network structure data and node attribute data, to enable AI-style knowledge inference for large social networks still remains unsolved. In this paper, we design and implement a scalable framework that treats link prediction as knowledge reasoning using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). Differing from other probabilistic graphical models, MLNs allow undirected relationships with cycles and long-range (non-adjacent) dependency, which are essential and abound in social networks. In our framework, the prior knowledge is captured as the structure dependency (such as friendship) and the attribute dependency (such as social communities) in terms of inference rules, associated with uncertainty represented as probabilities. Next, we employ the random walk to discover the inference subgraph, on which probabilistic inference is performed, so that the required computation and storage cost can be significantly reduced without much sacrifice of the inference accuracy. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets verify the superiority of our proposed approaches over two baseline methods and show that our approaches are able to provide a tunable tradeoff between inference accuracy and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7736107/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Feb. 2017,ieeexplore

Recent approaches simultaneously explore visual, user and tag information to improve the performance of image retagging by mining the tag-image-user associations. However, such methods will become computationally infeasible with the rapidly increasing number of images, tags and users. It has been proven that the anchor graph can significantly accelerate large-scale graph-based learning by exploring only a small number of anchor points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularized Tensor Completion (SUGAR-TC) method to efficiently refine the tags of social images, which is insensitive to the scale of data. First, we construct an anchor-unit graph across multiple domains (e.g., image and user domains) rather than traditional anchor graph in a single domain. Second, a tensor completion based on Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularization (SUGAR) is implemented to refine the tags of the anchor images.

It brings the real challenge to distinguish that what particular information is credible. Especially when user authenticity is hidden, due to the microblog’s anonymity feature. Low credibility content creates an imbalance in society. Therefore many research studies are conducted to assess automatic microblog’s credibility but the majority of them offer different concepts of credibility and the problem seems unresolved. Credibility is multi-disciplinary, hence there is no generalized or accepted credibility concept with all its necessary and detailed constructs/components. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the complete anatomy of information credibility from different disciplines. It is accomplished here through an in-depth and organized study of all the problem dimensions for the identification of comprehensive and necessary credibility constructs. The framework is also proposed based on the identified constructs. It adheres to these constructs and presents their inter-relationships. It is believed that the framework would provide the necessary building blocks for implementing an effective automatic credibility assessment system. The framework is generic to social media and specifically implemented for microblogs. It is completely transformed up to features level, in the context of microblogs. Regarding automatic credibility assessment, it is proposed after detailed analysis that the attempt should be made for hybrid models combining feature-based and graph-based approaches. It is observed that quite a few surveys in the literature focus on some limited aspects of microblogs credibility but no literature survey and fundamental study exists that consolidates the work done. To understand the broader domain of credibility and consolidate the work in this area that can lead us to a suitable framework, we explored the existing literature from different disciplines for the said objectives.

Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8011466/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated.

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

10.1109/ICSECS52883.2021.00051,A Data-oriented Approach for Detecting offensive Language in Arabic Tweets,IEEE,Conferences,"The growing popularity of social media (SM) platforms has made these platforms a crucial part of modern societies. Users from different cultures, backgrounds, demographics get aboard in an increasing manner to express their views, stances, and opinions on a varied range of topics. Since users on SM can easily hide their real identity, a closer look at daily posts on social medial platforms shows that users do not seem to reflect only their stances and views, but also, they get an opportunity for revealing their behaviors, which could be negative towards the others. Although only a small population of SM users can show negative behavior towards other individuals, groups, and society in general, the impact could be catastrophic. This has resulted in the emerge of terms like cyberbullying, online extremism/hatred/threatening, online trolling, online political-polarity discourse. To ensure safe social networking, the domain of automatic detection of offensive/hatred language has lately grown notably. This work focuses on utilizing a publicly available dataset of Arabic tweets labeled for offensive/non-offensive language. Unlike previous work which focuses merely on developing and tuning machine learning models to be as accurate as possible on the benchmark dataset used, we turn to focus on the characteristics of the offensive language used in SM. The purpose is to have an in-depth look into the dataset to disclose what seems to be hidden patterns in offensive language expressed daily online. Our findings reveal the benefit of using larger training dataset that covers a wide range of offensive language patterns to build robust machine learning classifiers with a better ability to generalize well on highly sparse data used in SM.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9537044/,2021 International Conference on Software Engineering & Computer Systems and 4th International Conference on Computational Science and Information Management (ICSECS-ICOCSIM),24-26 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/DSAA49011.2020.00043,A Graph Convolutional Encoder and Decoder Model for Rumor Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"With the development of technology and the expansion of social media, rumors spread widely and the rumor detection has gradually caused widespread concern. The early method of using handcrafted features has been eliminated due to inefficiency, and deep learning methods have been gradually adopted in recent years. However, most of the methods only consider content information such as text, which is often not enough for the specific field, rumor detection. Some studies take propagation rule into consideration, such as Kernel-based, RvNN. In addition, the structure formed via propagation of rumors and non-rumors have different properties. Compared with dynamic propagation, structure here is the final result of propagation and it's static and global. In order to enhance the structure information, we proposes a model that obtains textual, propagation and structure information. The model contains three components: Encoder, Decoder, and Detector. The encoder uses the efficient Graph Convolutional Network to regard the initial text as input and update the representation through propagation to learn text and propagation information. Then the encoded representation would be used for subsequent decoder which uses AutoEncoder to learn the overall structure information. Simultaneously, the detector utilizes the output of encoder to classify events as fake or not. These three modules are jointly trained to improve the model effect. We verified our method on three real-world datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9260014/,2020 IEEE 7th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA),6-9 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICTAI.2018.00138,A Graph Resilience Metric Based On Paths: Higher Order Analytics With GPU,IEEE,Conferences,"Structural resilience is an inherent, paramount property of real world, massive, scale free graphs such as those typically encountered in brain networks, protein-to-protein interaction diagrams, logistics and supply chains, as well as social media among others. This means that in case a small fraction of edges or even vertices with their incident edges are deleted, then alternative, although possibly longer, paths can be found such that the overall graph connectivity remains intact. This durability, which is constantly exhibited in nature, can be attributed to three main reasons. First, almost by construction, scale free graphs have a relatively high density. Moreover, they have a short diameter or at least an effective diameter. Finally, scale free graphs are recursively built on communities. As a consequence, the effect of a few edge or even vertex deletions inside a community remains isolated there as a rule and the effects of deletion are thus negated. Ultimately these properties stem from the degree distribution. In this conference paper is proposed a new, generic, and scalable graph resilience metric which relies on the weighted sum of the number of paths crossing certain vertices of great communication and structural value. Finally, the CUDA implementation is discussed and compared to a serial one in mex.

However, there are several problems obstructing applying general CRFs on online social network data mining tasks. For demonstration, we propose a unified CRF model for trust prediction to tackle the following problems: trust relationships are directed but existing work mostly deals with undirected links; online social networks are generally large and sparse, and traditional methods and their implementations perform poor on large datasets in both predictive accuracy and time efficiency. The proposed model has its unifications in three aspects: it models various types of entities in online social networks and captures the interconnection and interplay between them, it considers both directed links and undirected links, and it can embrace an arbitrary number of features to model the real-world online social networks.

10.1109/ICCCIS51004.2021.9397140,A Parsimonious and Practical Approach to Detecting Offensive Speech,IEEE,Conferences,"With the proliferation of hateful and offensive speech on social media platforms such as Twitter, machine learning approaches to detect such toxic content have gained prominence. Despite these advances, real-time detection of such speech, while it is being shared on these platforms, remains a challenge for two reasons. First, these approaches train complex models on a plethora of features, which calls into question their computational efficiency for real-time deployment. Moreover, they require sizeable, manually annotated data sets from the same context, and annotating large data sets is extremely time-consuming, error-prone and cumbersome. This paper proposes a parsimonious and practical approach for the detection of offensive speech that alleviates these challenges. The approach is parsimonious because through a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) on two public domain data sets it demonstrates that a simple Logistic Regression model trained on unigrams with frequency counts can detect hate speech with high accuracy of over 90%. It is practical because it demonstrates how an existing labeled training data set can be used to train models that can detect offensive content from a completely unknown data set with moderate accuracy. Based on these findings, the paper offers guidance on the characteristics that may be desirable in benchmark training data sets for offensive speech detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397140/,"2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems (ICCCIS)",19-20 Feb. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICTAI.2014.59,A Practical Negotiation-Based Team Formation Model for Non-cooperative Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Team formation is an effective collaboration manner in social networks (SNs). Within teams, social individuals can work together to accomplish complex jobs that they are unable to perform individually. Due to its wide range of applications, team formation in SNs has been studied extensively and a number of approaches have been proposed. However, all of these proposals either build teams of individuals to accomplish jobs through a centralized manner or ignore the selfish nature of social individuals, or both. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized negotiation-based team formation model for non-cooperative SNs, where social individuals are self-interested. The proposed team formation model works by allowing the employer (i.e., Job initiator) to recruit a team of professional employees that demand small working remuneration and incur little communication overhead and allowing the employees to join the beneficial teams from which they can achieve a high financial remuneration. The simulation results show that our model achieves about 80% social welfare of the ideal centralized models on average. Moreover, compared to other conventional distributed models, our model can reduce team formation time significantly, making our model a better choice for the real-world time-sensitive applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6984495/,2014 IEEE 26th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence,10-12 Nov. 2014,ieeexplore

Furthermore, the number of computational frameworks proposed to date to deploy these type of experiments is reduced.

The motivation behind the proposed framework is therefore straightforward: to allow researchers to be able to configure without difficulty public goods experiments where they can test their hypothesis regarding the behaviour of individuals, simulate behaviour of automated artificial intelligence and study the interaction between virtual agents and real persons. The greatest advantage of the INVITE framework is that it provides a high level of flexibility in the configuration of game theoretical paradigms. It is possible to configure simple structures such as the 2-player prisoner's dilemma or stag hunt as well as some of the most complex forms of inter-group conflicts such as team games. Accordingly, this framework allows an effortless parametrization, assisted by a tailored configuration tool, of a myriad of public goods games. Moreover, the 3D video game configured in the framework places the players in an immersive and engaging virtual environment where real-life conditions can be replicated and some circumstances, difficult to reproduce in real-life, such as life-threatening situations, can also be simulated.

However, analyzing huge amount of data manually is not possible in time context of business. Therefore, automated sentimental analysis, which can automatically determine the sentiments from the text data corpus plays an important role in today's world. Many sentimental analysis frameworks with state of the art results have been proposed in the literature. However, many of these frameworks have low accuracy on the textual data corpus contains emoticons and special texts. In addition, many of these frameworks are also energy and computation intensive with which puts limitation in their real time deployment. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by proposing a novel sentimental analysis framework based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed framework uses a novel technique to tokenize the text documents, wherein stop words, special characters, emoticons present in the text documents are eliminated. In addition, words with similar meanings and annotations are clubbed together into one type, using the concept of stemming. The pre-processed tokenized documents are then vectorized into n-gram integers vectors using the `TfidfVectorizer' for use as input to the SVM based machine learning classifier model. Experimental results on the Amazon's electronics item review dataset and IMDB's movie review data corpus show that the proposed sentimental analysis framework achieves high performance compared to other similar frameworks proposed in the literature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9056085/,2020 National Conference on Communications (NCC),21-23 Feb. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1049/cp:19990285,A neural vision based controller for a robot footballer,IET,Conferences,"Robot football is growing in popularity both as a research topic and as a sporting event. The football setting provides rich interaction possibilities and a ready source of competition in an environment containing both predictable and non-deterministic elements. Successful players must be able to react quickly in real time, exhibit multiple competences and choose between several possibly conflicting goals. Opportunities exist to explore reflexive behaviour, strategic behaviour and even communication and social behaviour in team events. At the same time, artificial neural networks are increasingly being used in robot controllers to explore new biologically-inspired ideas relating to perception, memory and motor control. The research described in this paper attempts to combine these two areas of study to produce a framework for a neurally based and visually guided football-playing controller. A controller architecture is proposed in which a small set of high-level features in the robot's environment are extracted from raw image data by using a feedforward neural network.

In this article, we propone a three (03) step approach for the detection and analysis of phishing on Twitter, which can be applied to several other social networks. The first step is to browse a database called “Blacklist” in search of the suspicious URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Subsequently, we proceed to URL (Uniform Resource Locator) analysis leveraging machine learning techniques introducing new features. In this step the three following classifiers were used namely, Regression Logistics, SVM (Support vector Machine) and Random Forest.

10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415650,A qualitative and quantitative method for predicting sentiment toward deployed U.S. forces,IEEE,Conferences,"The ability to automatically predict likelihood of reaction to specific events and situational awareness is important to many military and commercial applications. Gauging population sentiment for targeted response areas and having the ability to predict or control sentiment within these areas is invaluable. Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses. Sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly important and feasible task based on social media, open source data, physical imagery and abundance of video data feeds. Predicting reaction to events can be time consuming. Locating the most likely affected areas is very tedious, requiring much human labor effort, and it is often difficult to obtain the best information on a timely basis.

Attackers may combine phishing emails, malware, social engineering and botnets to create a series of attacks in one APT attack which makes it quite difficult for detection. In this way, attackers can remotely control the infected host, or steal sensitive information. In this paper, we proposed a time transform features approach for distinguishing APT attacks based on the observation that malicious payload must be transferred to the target hosts in an APT attack. By comparing the normal traffic with the traffic containing a malicious payload, we are able to catch the signal of malicious payload and further infer the existence of APT attacks. Then we use machine learning methods to detect APT attacks in big data. To verify this approach, we placed a device on the gateway of our university for catching the real Internet traffic of the university for one month.

10.1109/FCCM.2017.58,Accelerating Large-Scale Graph Analytics with FPGA and HMC,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph analytics that explores the relationship among interconnected entities is becoming increasingly important due to its broad applicability from machine learning to social science. However, one major challenge for graph processing systems is the irregular data access pattern of graph computation which can significantly degrade the performance. The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit. The merging unit takes the best advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluated the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications. We observed that the combination of the clustering algorithm and the merging hardware achieved 2.8 × average performance improvement compared to the latest FPGA-HMC based graph processing system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966655/,2017 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM),30 April-2 May 2017,ieeexplore

On the other hand, the computation complexity of many graph pattern matching algorithms is expensive, and it is not affordable to extract patterns from million-scale graphs. Moreover, most real-world networks are time-evolving, updating their structures continuously, which makes it harder to update and output newly matched patterns in real time. Many incremental graph pattern matching algorithms which reduce the number of updates have been proposed to handle such dynamic graphs. However, it is still challenging to recompute vertices in the incremental graph pattern matching algorithms in a single process, and that prevents the real-time analysis. We propose an incremental graph pattern matching algorithm to deal with time-evolving graph data and also propose an adaptive optimization system based on reinforcement learning to recompute vertices in the incremental process more efficiently. Then we discuss the qualitative efficiency of our system with several types of data graphs and pattern graphs. We evaluate the performance using million-scale attributed and time-evolving social graphs.

A basic and crucial point for any energy company is how much energy to buy. That is, determining the amount of energy to be purchased as close as possible to that needed to serve its customers, avoiding financial losses by consuming more or less than they have. However, this is not a trivial problem, as energy consumption depends on several exogenous and endogenous factors, such as all the problems previously mentioned, in addition to economic, social, climatic, political and cultural aspects, among others. Thus, energy forecasts are realized with aid of both statistical analyzes and computational techniques. This article exposes a very short and short term energy forecast model using Neural Networks and feedback, applied in the new global context: the new coronavirus pandemic and its implications for energy consumption. The method was implemented with a real consumption dataset provided by the Brazilian energy company Equatorial from Para State and from Maranhao State. Very short term energy forecasts results reached a MAPE of around 1.2% in a 15-day window for both States, Para and Maranhao. For short term energy forecasts, results for both States were 3 possible scenarios in a window from June to December 2020, due to the unpredictability of the pandemic, especially in Brazil, which so far has shown no signs of reducing the contagion curve.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9258775/,"2020 IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)",4-6 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICTer51097.2020.9325474,Adjusting The Hard Level on Game by a Prediction for Improving Attraction and Business Value,IEEE,Conferences,"The computer gaming industry has become more popular among the young generation over the years. It became a sport and According to past studies, people choose computer games over physical games (outdoor games) due to their busy lifestyles which crack social relationships and fear of injuries. There are around 2.2 billion gamers around the world. Out of the assessed 7.6 billion individuals living on earth, as of July 2018, that implies nearly 33% of individuals on this planet are gamers. Out of those 2.2 billion gamers, 1.2 billion of the players play PC game. An online survey was conducted to collect information from random game players and non-game players scattered throughout Sri Lanka to identify the problems faced by them when playing the games and why others do not play the game or are discouraged to play games. 354 participants participated in this survey. In which 127 of the participants were Female and 227 Male. The participation age range was identified as 15 to 49 Years. The research team was able to summarize that 80.04% of the participants play games while 19.06% don't play games. Out of the participants who play games, 9.08% are pro players while the rest of the 78% of players are intermediate players. We identified that the main problems faced by most of the players are as follows: Some missions are too easy and boring or players getting stuck in the middle of the level because the level is too hard or because the mission is too hard to complete. The Popularity of games can be varied according to the players' skill level. Tasks of a game can be boring if it's too easy for a skilled player. On the other hand, if it's too hard for a beginner level player, it may tend to give up the game. The other problem identified was the inability of game character customization as per the preference of 92.07% of gamers who participated in the survey. According to their responses, we were able to understand the problems that they faced while playing the game and what they expect in a game. Therefore, the research team proposes a game that changes the level of hardness/complexity of the level according to the players' mood automatically. In simple terms, the game will `adjust and adopt' based on the user's emotions. The next level will be automatically designed based on the player record of the previous level using an algorithm that takes the emotions as inputs. To achieve this, the gamer's heart pulse rate, facial expression, and speed of using the controls are captured and analysed to obtain the most accurate emotion level of the player using machine learning. The level of emotions is taken along with the parameters such as age, gender, and haptic feedback to adjust the hardness level of the level.It is important to identify the player skill level to understand the user's experience as a gamer. To determine a player's skill level in the background, a keylogger captures the pressed key and the time it takes to press the key. It is also necessary to identify the emotional state of the player to provide a unique user experience to the player and it can be done in two ways which are facial expression and heart-pulse. Facial expression detection results in identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individual such as happiness, anger, and neutral which will be necessary for the adaptive game, and also the emotional range of a player is predicted. Additionally, age, gender, and face-shape are determined. The dataset is trained using machine learning to detect the facial expression and identify the emotion, age, gender, and face-shape of the individual. The Facial Expression of the player will be captured in real-time from the web camera of the computer and the emotion will be identified automatically as well as the age gender and face-shape. The other method is through Heart pulse, Heart pulse also can be used to detect the emotions of the player. There are 3 types of emotion levels Happy, Fear, Neutral. To do this, the heart rate sensor is used to capture the player's heart rate. According to the output received after training the dataset using machine learning algorithms and the skill level output is used to adjust the level of the game while the gamer is playing the game. To obtain a much more accurate emotional level, the heartbeat level, and the facial emotional level are analysed together. We have created a new model for analysing the above data using linear regression. Using the said model, the gender, age, the skill level of the player as well as the difficulty in the level of the game can be identified. The next level of the game will be designed using the data from the previous level and this process will continue until the player quits the game. A model is trained by using machine learning technology to predict character characteristics (moving speed, health regenerating) of the game character. The difficulty level of the player is taken as input for the training process. The output characteristics are given by an in-game module and adjust the characteristics of the game character until the player quits playing. The AI algorithm performs the process of reflecting the characteristics of the player to the in-game character. Age, gender, and face-shape are used as input data. The algorithm process input data to generate a unique set of variables. The variables manipulate the appearance of the in-game character until the player quits playing. Our game is developed within three months; therefore, it is difficult to predict the emotions or obtain a skill level like in an existing commercialized game because the demo game doesn't evoke any emotions or measure the skill level of the player. So, we have tested our application with the other similar existing games and we were able to obtain an accurate emotion and skill level. Even though the game is designed in a way to change the levels and character abilities based on the inputs obtained, we can't do so in other existing games. Therefore, the player records obtained from the games we tested were taken into a text record and analysed separately. Based on the analysed data we were able to obtain an accuracy level of 68%.In the future, the demo game will be further developed and tested with our system to obtain an emotion. The option of changing the game character based on the player's appearance is 75% successful, in which face-shape and gender were used. In the future, we will be using age as well. In the future a profile can be designed based on skill level, therefore making it possible to adjust the game based on a player's past record.This system provides a solution to problems faced by the game players such as the game being too easy and boring or hard and stressful. This can also prevent health issues that can be caused when a person gets too angry or violent and stress.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325474/,2020 20th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer),4-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

As the volume of data from the social world is exploding, social media data analysis has become an emerging area in many different disciplines. During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event.

With the increasing number of social media usage, a trend has been observed of users creating posts related to adverse drug reactions (ADR). Mining social media data for these information can be used for pharmacological post-marketing surveillance and monitoring. However, the development of automatic ADR detection systems remains challenging because the corpora compiled from real world social media were usually highly imbalanced resulting in barriers to develop classifiers with reliable performance. In this work, we implemented a variety of imbalanced techniques and compared their performance on two large imbalanced data sets released for the purpose of detecting ADR posts.

The crux of this increasing dependence on the internet is the rise of different kinds of cyberattacks on unsuspecting users. One such attack is phishing, which aims at stealing user information via deceptive websites. The primary defense against phishing consists of maintaining a black list of the phishing URLs. However, a black list approach is reactive and cannot defend against new phishing websites. For this reason, a number of research have been done on using machine learning techniques to detect previously unseen phishing URLs. While they show promising results, any such implementation is yet to be seen. This is because 1) little work has been done on developing a complete end-to-end framework for phishing URL detection 2) it is prohibitively slow to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms. In this work we address these two issues by formulating a robust framework for fast and automated detection of phishing URLs.

10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381339,An Implicit Crowdsourcing Approach to Rumor Identification in Online Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"With the increasing use of online social networks as a source of news and information, the propensity for a rumor to disseminate widely and quickly poses a great concern, especially in disaster situations where users do not have enough time to fact-check posts before making the informed decision to react to a post that appears to be credible. At the same time, we know that misinformation is easily detectable by a certain few, very skeptical, or very informed users. In this study, we demonstrate how blending artificial intelligence and human skills can create a new paradigm for credibility prediction. The crowdsourcing part of the detection mechanism is implemented implicitly, by simply observing the natural interaction between users encountering the messages. Specifically, we explore the spread of information on Twitter at the microscopic (user-to-user propagation) level and propose a model that predicts if a message is True or False by observing the latent attributes of the message, along with those of the users interacting with it, and their reactions to the message. We demonstrate the application of this model to the detection of misinformation and rank the relevant message and user features that are most critical in influencing the spread of rumor over the network. Our experiments using real-world data show that the proposed model achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting the credibility of posts on Twitter, a significant boost over state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381339/,2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),7-10 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

To achieve these human-like actions, the virtual inhabitant should behave diversely, live long in the virtual environment, make social relationships with others, keep the relationships in his lifetime, and have self-updating abilities. To fulfill these requirements, we design the architecture to utilize the agent's full rationality, discrepancies, and other human-like features such as oblivions, and so on as the essential sources of an agent's diverse and social actions. We roughly divide the architecture into four submodules and sophisticatedly design each module in order to support these features effectively.

The irony, with a simple definition, is the creative use of language, and it has recently attracted the attention of computer scientists. There is a vast amount of raw data, collected from social media resources, containing ironical statements. It is very difficult to analyze the rapidly growing data manually. Additionally, the character size limitations and typographical errors of online social media tools make the traditional methods of classification insufficient for detection task. In this study, the detection of irony in online social media is modeled as a classification problem, and the success of supervised machine learning methods in real data is assessed. Bayesian Network (BayesNet), OneR, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF), Voted Perceptron, IBk, Randomizable Filtered Classifier (RFC), Isolation Forest, Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR), and Bagging algorithms are applied for the first time on irony detection problem and a comprehensive evaluation is provided.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8965580/,2019 1st International Informatics and Software Engineering Conference (UBMYK),6-7 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

Recommending activities for a group has become an important task in many information systems. Group recommendation not only needs to aggregate the preferences of group members, but also needs to properly understand the group decision-making process. In addition to integrating the individual preferences of each member of the group, we also need to consider the interactive information among users, groups and activities, so as to assign a higher influence weight to the experts or leaders in the group. Based on the attention mechanism and the latest development of NCF, we contribute a novel solution, namely NCF-AGREE, which can learn aggregation strategies according to historical data, so as to better solve the problem of group preference aggregation. In order to adapt to group recommendation, different members of the group are assigned weights.

The existing studies have successfully explored user-item interaction via GCN for recommendation task and proved its effectiveness. We argue that a significant limitation of these methods is that social relation, which has been proven to impose positive effects for recommendation in many loss optimization models, has received relatively little scrutiny in GCN. Thus, the resultant embeddings are insufficient to model the potential social propagation effect. In our work, we propose to obtain embeddings by using the neighborhood propagation mechanism on two coupled graph neural networks, i.e., user-item interaction graph and social relation graph, which is capable of capturing the interplay between the item taste of user and user connection. In particular, to address the challenge that different factors on neighborhood propagation process make different contributions for the embedding, we develop a new social recommendation framework with hierarchical attention(i.e., neighbor-level and graph-level attention) Attentional Social Recommendation system (ASR). This allows much flexibility for adaptively acquiring relative importance for different factors. Extensive experiment on two real-world datasets not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the baselines, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of simultaneous neighborhood propagation on two graphs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9534075/,2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),18-22 July 2021,ieeexplore

While various approaches for the automated generation of Conceptual Enterprise Models exist, for example in requirements engineering, process mining or in the context of Digital Twins, the approaches mostly support only parts of the modeling process. Additionaly, the approaches lack a common base, such as standardized frameworks. Therefore, my further research aims at showing how conceptual modeling can be automated, developing a modeling standard for Digital Twins in enterprise context, showing its technical feasibility and evaluating the implementation in real-world use cases.

10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00084,Autonomous Graph Mining Algorithm Search with Best Speed/Accuracy Trade-off,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph data is ubiquitous in academia and industry, from social networks to bioinformatics. The pervasiveness of graphs today has raised the demand for algorithms that can answer various questions: Which products would a user like to purchase given her order list? Which users are buying fake followers to increase their public reputation? Myriads of new graph mining algorithms are proposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem formulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes it difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the most suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more severe for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques developed in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoGM, an automated system for graph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework UnifiedGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms, ranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks. Then UnifiedGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to determine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AutoGM explicitly optimizes for the optimal parameter set of UnifiedGM using Bayesian Optimization. AutoGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the optimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy trade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation problem. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AutoGM generates novel graph mining algorithms with the best speed/accuracy trade-off compared to existing models with heuristic parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9338289/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to `proof' that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data - or `Digital identities' - pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a `real' identity.This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual's digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a `real' identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques. Where identity sources are considered reliable, a secure and intelligent digital identification artefact will be created. This artefact will emulate a blockchain-inspired ledger and may subsequently be used to prove identity in place of traditional paper documentation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8585369/,2018 29th Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC),21-22 June 2018,ieeexplore

Consequently, there are two types of VR learners: Performers who acquire virtual learning experience through direct engagement in VR and observers who acquire such experience vicariously through observation. To explore the influence of learner type on VR learning, this study conducted a quasi-experiment with 53 elementary school students to examine the difference in VR learning experiences between the performers and the observers. The study results supported the observed VR learning experience as an adequate alternative to direct VR engagement as the observers demonstrated overall comparable learning patterns in reflection, emotion, engagement, and social interaction during the post-VR debriefing, except for the behaviors of recall and interpretation. The research findings can shed light on the issues of accessibility and equity in VR-based instruction and inform the design and implementation of large-scale VR educational programs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9459413/,2021 7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN),17 May-10 June 2021,ieeexplore

It has also disturbed economy, environment and social norms leading to many problems and giving birth to different rules and laws in order to ensure public safety. Wearing masks is one of the most important and primitive precautionary measures along with safe social distancing as advised by the World Health Organization. To manually monitor people not wearing face mask in order to ensure public safety is definitely a strenuous task. Therefore, this research work proposes a real time face mask detection system by applying computer vision and machine learning concepts like convolution neural networks and refined MobileNetV2 architecture to ease the deployment of proposed model in embedded devices with limited computational capacity. The dataset utilized here is available on Kaggle as Face mask detection dataset. The model is trained using Adam Optimizer algorithm which is best suited for deep learning models and is built using Keras, TensorFlow and OpenCV. The proposed model touches 99% accuracy under various training to testing ratios like 70% training and 30% testing,50% training and 50% testing etc. Precision, recall, f-score and support are calculated for all trials.

Computational solutions for automatic bias and sensationalism detection for news articles can have tremendous impact if used in the right way. Because news is an ever-shifting domain, concept drift is an issue that must be dealt with in any real-world computational news classification system that relies on features and trained machine learning models. Yet, an empirical study of concept drift in such systems, especially popular systems released recently as open-source and used within organizations, has been lacking thus far. This short paper reports results on an empirical study specifically designed to assess concept drift, using an open-source, popular computational news classification system, on real news data crawled from the Web.

Smart phones take on a heightened role in emergency situations, as they may suddenly be among their owner's only possessions and resources. The 2016 wildfire in Fort McMurray, Canada, intrigued us to study the functionality of the existing apps by analyzing social media information. We investigated a method to suggest features that are useful for emergency apps. Our proposed method called MAPFEAT, combines various machine learning techniques to analyze tweets in conjunction with crowdsourcing and guides an extended search in app stores to find currently missing features in emergency apps based on the needs stated in social media. MAPFEAT is evaluated by a real-world case study of the Fort McMurray wildfire, where we analyzed 69,680 unique tweets recorded over a period from May 2nd to May 7th, 2016. We found that (i) existing wildfire apps covered a range of 28 features with not all of them being considered helpful or essential, (ii) a large range of needs articulated in tweets can be mapped to features existing in non-emergency related apps, and (iii) MAPFEAT's suggested feature set is better aligned with the needs expressed by general public. Only six of the features existing in wildfire apps is among top 40 crowdsourced features explored by MAPFEAT, with the most important one just ranked 13th.

The proposed system is based on a fully convolutional neural network that maps the raw sensory data into a confidence map for path extraction. Additionally, a classification network is introduced to reduce the unnecessary re-plannings and ensures that the vehicle goes back to the global path when re-planning is not needed. The imitation learning based path planner is implemented on an autonomous wheelchair and tested in a new real-world dynamic pedestrian environment.

A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, antilockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information.

In this paper, we propose a real-time suicidal ideation detection system deployed over Weibo, using machine learning and known psychological techniques. Currently, we have identified 53 known suicidal cases who posted suicide notes on Weibo prior to their deaths. We explore linguistic features of these known cases using a psychological lexicon dictionary, and train an effective suicidal Weibo post detection model. 6714 tagged posts and several classifiers are used to verify the model. By combining both machine learning and psychological knowledge, SVM classifier has the best performance of different classifiers, yielding an F-measure of 68:3%, a Precision of 78:9%, and a Recall of 60:3%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7307052/,2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops,9-12 Dec. 2014,ieeexplore
10.1109/IROS.2018.8594335,Detection- Tracking for Efficient Person Analysis: The DetTA Pipeline,IEEE,Conferences,"In the past decade many robots were deployed in the wild, and people detection and tracking is an important component of such deployments. On top of that, one often needs to run modules which analyze persons and extract higher level attributes such as age and gender, or dynamic information like gaze and pose. The latter ones are especially necessary for building a reactive, social robot-person interaction. In this paper, we combine those components in a fully modular detection-tracking-analysis pipeline, called DetTA. We investigate the benefits of such an integration on the example of head and skeleton pose, by using the consistent track ID for a temporal filtering of the analysis modules' observations, showing a slight improvement in a challenging real-world scenario. We also study the potential of a so-called “free-flight” mode, where the analysis of a person attribute only relies on the filter's predictions for certain frames. Here, our study shows that this boosts the runtime dramatically, while the prediction quality remains stable. This insight is especially important for reducing power consumption and sharing precious (GPU-)memory when running many analysis components on a mobile platform, especially so in the era of expensive deep learning methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594335/,2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),1-5 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

This was achieved by the introduction of a set of proxemics, body posture and attention features relevant for human-human interaction. The features were extracted from RGB-D image data of a single Kinect and utilized to train two separate machine learning models. Multiple system configurations and feature combinations were tested, and their impact on the detection of user engagement evaluated. Combining all features, our perception system reaches an F1-score of 81% when estimating an observed person’s interaction intent through binary classification. Regression of a user’s level of availability deviates from the given ground truth values by 13.27% on average. Finally, a prototype was implemented which is able to simultaneously run both previous estimates in real-time using a shared feature vector.

However, due to the prohibition of public road tests in Japan, there are few examples of actual applications of robots. Therefore, considerations and problems in the practical application of robots are still unclear. In this paper, by focusing on the implementation of garbage collection technology, we have developed an autonomous garbage collection robot using deep learning. In addition, we have verified the usefulness of our garbage detection technology in outdoor environments by conducting actual demonstrations at HANEDA INNOVATION CITY, which is a large-scale commercial and business complex belonged private property, Utsunomiya University, and Nakanoshima Challenge 2019, which is a field of demonstration experiment in the outdoor environment.

Therefore, the search of such power agent can be validated through a machine learning approach that enables us to discover the agent dynamics in which drives the evolution of the social groups in a community. By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilistic model for the agent dynamics: the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters. Our approach is to identify the appropriate parameters in the model. To solve the problem, we develop heuristic expectation-maximization style algorithms for determining the micro-laws of a community based on either observed communication links between actors, or the observed evolution of social groups.

The properties of software agents like autonomy, reactivity, pro-activity and their social ability make them more center of focus for the real world problems. The accomplishment of any complex task is required to be done by the agents autonomously without any user intervention in order to achieve high reliability and adaptability. This paper mainly concentrates on the task allocation problem in multi-agent systems. Task Allocation is an important and challenging problem. This can be defined as the problem of allocating tasks among agents within a multi-agent system. Main objective of the task allocation problem is to maximize the number of successfully completed task and overall system utility without any conflict. To accomplish any complex task, agents negotiate, cooperate and coordinate with each other. Many researchers are working in the field of task allocation in multiagent systems. In this paper, various approaches of task allocation in multi-agent systems are discussed. The comparison of these approaches is also providing that lead to a discussion and motivation of the task allocation problem for multi-agent systems.

The Influence of Visual Embodiment and Social Behavior on the Perception of Intelligent Virtual Agents in AR,IEEE,Conferences,"Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are becoming part of our everyday life, thanks to artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things devices. For example, users can control their connected home appliances through natural voice commands to the IVA. However, most current-state commercial IVAs, such as Amazon Alexa, mainly focus on voice commands and voice feedback, and lack the ability to provide non-verbal cues which are an important part of social interaction. Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to overcome this challenge by providing a visual embodiment of the IVA. In this paper we investigate how visual embodiment and social behaviors influence the perception of the IVA. We hypothesize that a user's confidence in an IVA's ability to perform tasks is improved when imbuing the agent with a human body and social behaviors compared to the agent solely depending on voice feedback. In other words, an agent's embodied gesture and locomotion behavior exhibiting awareness of the surrounding real world or exerting influence over the environment can improve the perceived social presence with and confidence in the agent. We present a human-subject study, in which we evaluated the hypothesis and compared different forms of IVAs with speech, gesturing, and locomotion behaviors in an interactive AR scenario. The results show support for the hypothesis with measures of confidence, trust, and social presence.

However, such tags cannot offer the expressivity of ontologies, and the respective tags often lack context-independent and explicit semantic. In this paper, we describe a model to extract domain concept from social tags. The model mainly includes three modules: a) Detecting the noun terminology through mutual information, b) Applying semantic dictionary to disambiguate between tags, c) Filtering the domain concept via domain relevance and consensus. Finally, experimental results on real world data sets show that the model can effectively learn the domain concept from social tags, and the concept also has a high degree of generality and applicability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6127957/,2011 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference,12-15 Dec. 2011,ieeexplore

In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we first extract a set of features from the Android applications (apps) and represent them as binary feature vectors; with these inputs, we then explore the security of a generic learning-based classifier for Android malware detection in the presence of adversaries. To harden the evasion, we first present count featurization to transform the binary feature space into continuous probabilities encoding the distribution in each class (either benign or malicious). To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further introduce softmax function with adversarial parameter to find the best trade-off between security and accuracy for the classifier. Accordingly, we develop a system named DroidEye which integrates our proposed method for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DroidEye against adversarial Android malware attacks.

Meanwhile, it inevitably poses the risk of generating and disseminating false information by both benign and malicious users. Despite there has been considerable research on false information detection from both the opinion-based and fact-based perspectives, they mostly focus on tailored solutions for a particular domain and carry out limited work on leveraging multi-faceted clues such as textual cues, behavioral trails, and relational connection. We propose a novel dual-stream attentive random forest that is capable of selecting clues of discriminative information from individuals, collective information (e.g., texts), and correlations of entities (e.g., social interactions) adaptively. In particular, we use an interpretive attention model for learning textual contents. The model treats the important and unimportant content differently when constructing the textual representation and employs a multilayer perceptron to capture the hidden complex relationships among features of side information. We further propose a unified framework for leveraging the above clues, where we use attentive forests to provide probabilistic distribution as predictions over the two learned representations, which are then leveraged to make a better estimation. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets for fake news and fake review detection.

It is, however, difficult for us to realize such a learning mechanism in the real world because each agent is exposed only to local interactions with others. Therefore, each agent must acquire a capability, ""sociality"", which finds its own role or niche in the social environment, even if the individual's learning system is self-closed. In this paper, we emphasize that the emergence of ""sociality"" seems to depend on the dual capabilities of an agent's referencing; self-referential and social-referential abilities. In addition, we present a learning model of an agent having such dual referencing capabilities as a bi-referential model, in which each referencing capability is implemented by an evolutional computation method of classifier system.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology for hashtag recommendation for microblog posts, specifically Twitter. The methodology, EmTaggeR, is built upon a training-testing framework that builds on the top of the concept of word embedding. The training phase comprises of learning word vectors associated with each hashtag, and deriving a word embedding for each hashtag. We provide two training procedures, one in which each hashtag is trained with a separate word embedding model applicable in the context of that hashtag, and another in which each hashtag obtains its embedding from a global context. The testing phase constitutes computing the average word embedding of the test post, and finding the similarity of this embedding with the known embeddings of the hashtags. The tweets that contain the most-similar hashtag are extracted, and all the hashtags that appear in these tweets are ranked in terms of embedding similarity scores. The top-K hashtags that appear in this ranked list, are recommended for the given test post.

Although many spam filters have been created to help prevent these spam emails from entering a user's inbox, there is a lack or research focusing on text modifications. Currently, Naive Bayes is one of the most popular methods of spam classification because of its simplicity and efficiency.

However, while such human sensor data have been exploited for retrospective large-scale event detection such as hurricanes or earthquakes, there has been limited to no success in exploiting this rich resource for general physical event detection. Prior implementation approaches have suffered from the concept drift phenomenon, where real-world data exhibits continuous, unknown, and unbounded changes in its data distribution, making static machine learning models ineffective in the long term. We propose and implement an end-to-end collaborative drift adaptive system that integrates corroborative and probabilistic sources to deliver real-time predictions. Furthermore, our system is adaptive to concept drift and performs automated continuous learning to maintain high performance. We demonstrate our approach in a real-time demo available online for landslide disaster detection, with extensibility to other real-world physical events such as flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8998489/,2019 IEEE 5th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC),12-14 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Much work has been done in short message analysis such as trend analysis, short message classification, etc. However, to generate an accurate and concise conclusion/assertion from all the relevant information remains challenging. In this paper we propose a method to analyse microblog messages at both `word/term' level and `concept' level to generate assertions accurately and instantly. To analyse the concept level, we define a small seed ontology which is a semi-automatically generated extension of an existing ontology. By doing this we achieve both accurate assertions and avoid the costly overhead of defining the whole knowledgebase manually. We then use the proposed method to make traffic assertions from a microblog stream to demonstrate the advantages of the approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7727781/,2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),24-29 July 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852006,Evolutionary Community Detection in Dynamic Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evolutionary clustering is a way of detecting the evolving patterns of communities in dynamic social networks. In principle, the detection process seeks to simultaneously maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize the clustering drift between two successive time steps. Several evolutionary clustering methods have been developed in an attempt to find the best trade-off between clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, but the classic genetic operators in these methods do not make the best of the inter- and intra-connected relationships between nodes, which limits their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel migration operator to work in tandem with classic genetic operators to improve the discovery of evolving community structures. The operator is implemented within an existing genetic algorithm which relies on a genome representation under a decomposition framework that formulates evolutionary community detection as a multiobjective optimization problem. Moreover, we present a new method of calculating modularity directly from a genome matrix as the objective for measuring the snapshot quality, which results in a wider search space for finding the optimal solution. Experimental results over several synthetic networks and one real-world dynamic social network suggest that our method is superior to two other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and smoothness in discovering evolving community structures in dynamic social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8852006/,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 July 2019,ieeexplore

MDS-Ach is a middleware made for the Xitome Mobile Dexterous Social (MDS) Robot originally released in 2008. The robot is being actively used at multiple locations including the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (NRL-LASR). The MDS-Ach middleware gives the MDS Robot the software capabilities of modern robot systems using the x- Ach real-time processes based architecture. It controls the MDS Robot directly over the controller area network (CAN) bus via a dedicated real-time daemon. Each process communicates with the others over a network capable shared memory. The shared memory is a ""first-in-last-out"" (i.e. reads the newest data first) non-head-of-line blocking ring buffer which ensures readability of latest data first while retaining the ability to retrieve the older data. When running over a network, UDP or TCP protocol can be utilized depending on the timing and reliability requirements. SSH tunneling is used when secure connections between networked controllers are required. The MDS-Ach middleware is designed to allow for simple and easy development with modern robotic tools while adding accessibility and usability to our non-hardware-focused partners.

Therefore, we expect imitation-based tasks to have diagnostic value. In this paper, we introduce two novel elements of human-robot interaction in the context of autism diagnostics. Instead of pure motoric imitation, we propose imitation tasks involving real objects in the environment. The introduction of physical objects strongly emphasizes joint attention skills, another area that is typically impaired in children with ASD. Furthermore, we present simple object detection, manipulation, tracking and gesture recognition algorithms, suitable for real-time, onboard execution on the small-scale humanoid robot NAO. The proposed system paves the way for fully autonomous execution of diagnostic tasks, which would simplify the deployment of robotic assistants in clinical settings. The source code for all described functionalities has been made publicly available as open-source software. We present a preliminary evaluation of the proposed system with a control group of typically developing preschool children and a group of seven children diagnosed with ASD.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8172498/,2017 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN),28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00018,Group Recommendation with Latent Voting Mechanism,IEEE,Conferences,"Group Recommendation (GR) is the task of suggesting relevant items/events for a group of users in online systems, whose major challenge is to aggregate the preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group. Prior group recommendation methods applied predefined static strategies for preference aggregation. However, these static strategies are insufficient to model the complicated decision making process of a group, especially for occasional groups which are formed adhoc. Compared to conventional individual recommendation task, GR is rather dynamic and each group member may contribute differently to the final group decision. Recent works argue that group members should have non-uniform weights in forming the decision of a group, and try to utilize a standard attention mechanism to aggregate the preferences of group members, but they do not model the interaction behavior among group members, and the decision making process is largely unexplored.In this work, we study GR in a more general scenario, that is Occasional Group Recommendation (OGR), and focus on solving the preference aggregation problem and the data sparsity issue of group-item interactions. Instead of exploring new heuristic or vanilla attention-based mechanism, we propose a new social self-attention based aggregation strategy by directly modeling the interactions among group members, namely Group Self-Attention (GroupSA). In GroupSA, we treat the group decision making process as multiple voting processes, and develop a stacked social self-attention network to simulate how a group consensus is reached. To overcome the data sparsity issue, we resort to the relatively abundant user-item and user-user interaction data, and enhance the representation of users by two types of aggregation methods. In the training process, we further propose a joint training method to learn the user/item embeddings in the group-item recommendation task and the user-item recommendation task simultaneously. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GroupSA method compared to several state-of-the-art methods in terms of HR and NDCG.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101842/,2020 IEEE 36th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),20-24 April 2020,ieeexplore

Data from smartphone sensors, a smartshirt's electrocardiogram and weather information from a web API are processed through a machine learning algorithm to infer emotional states. When negative emotions are detected, the application timely suggests walking exercises, while providing real-time information regarding nearby points of interest. This information includes events, background music, attendance, agitation and general mood. In addition, the system also dynamically adapts privacy and networking configurations based on emotions.

10.1109/BigData.2018.8621926,Harnessing the Nature of Spam in Scalable Online Social Spam Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Disinformation in social networks has been a worldwide problem. Social users are surrounded by a huge volume of malicious links, biased comments, fake reviews, or fraudulent advertisements, etc. Traditional spam detection approaches propose a variety of statistical feature-based models to filter out social spam from a historical dataset. However, they omit the real word situation of social data, that is, social spam is fast changing with new topics or events. Therefore, traditional approaches cannot effectively achieve online detection of the ""drifting"" social spam with a fixed statistic feature set. In this paper, we present Sifter, a system which can detect online social spam in a scalable manner without the labor-intensive feature engineering. The Sifter system is two-fold: (1) a decentralized DHT-based overlay deployment for harnessing the group characteristics of social spam activities within a specific topic/event; (2) a social spam processing with the support of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to get rid of the traditional manual feature engineering.

Heterogeneous information network embedding is an effective HIN analysis method, it aims at projecting network elements into a lower-dimensional vector space for further machine learning related evaluations, such as node classification, node clustering, and so on. However, existing HIN embedding methods mainly focus on extracting the semantic-related information or close neighboring relations, while the high-level proximity of the network is also important but not preserved. To address the problem, in this paper we propose CGAT, a semi-supervised heterogeneous information network embedding method. We optimize the graph attention network by adding additional convolution layers, thereby we can extract multiple types of semantics and preserve high-level information in HIN embedding at the same time. Also, we utilize label information in HINs for semi-supervised training to better obtain the model parameters and HIN embeddings.

First, the upper body poses of standing persons are classified into seven categories of views. For each category, a mean template, variance template, and percentage template are generated. Then, the template region is divided into positive and negative regions, corresponding to the region of bodies and surrounding open space. A weak classifier is designed for each pixel in the template. A new EM-like Adaboost learning algorithm is designed to learn the Adaboost template. Different from existing Adaboost classifiers, we show that the Adaboost template can be used not only for recognition but also for adaptive top-down segmentation. By using Adaboost template, only a few positive samples for each category are required for learning. Comparison with conventional template matching techniques has been made. Experimental results show that significant improvements can be achieved in both cases.

The algorithm is computationally light and simple to implement. We study its efficiency and safety in presence of sensing uncertainty, and demonstrate its implementation on real robots.

Many of the challenges and ongoing (r)evolutions appear to produce as yet seemingly contradictory requirements and thus produce potentially very interesting research areas. We argue that linguistics, community-based real world “social” semantics and pragmatics, scalability, the tri-sortal nature of the communities involved, the balance between usability and reusability, and the methodological requirements for non-disruptive adoption by enterprises of the new technologies provide vectors for fundamental computer science research, for interesting new artefacts, and for new valorisations of enterprise interoperability.

Because this data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way at scale, social media has been adopted as a “passive sensor” to study human behavior. However, such research is impacted by the lack of homogeneity in the use of social media, and the engineering challenges in obtaining such data. This paper proposes a statistical framework to leverage the potential of social media in sensing studies of human behavior, while navigating the challenges associated with its sparsity. Our framework is situated in a large-scale in-situ study concerning the passive assessment of psychological constructs of 757 information workers wherein of four sensing streams was deployed - bluetooth beacons, wearable, smartphone, and social media. Our framework includes principled feature transformation and machine learning models that predict latent social media features from the other passive sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this imputation framework via a high correlation of 0.78 between actual and imputed social media features. With the imputed features we test and validate predictions on psychological constructs like personality traits and affect.

For the purpose of human-robot interaction, the robot should have the ability to perform a variety of actions including face recognition, path planning, etc. In this paper, face recognition has been implemented on the Sanbot robot. Since the Sanbot robot is intended to work in real environment, therefore indoor and outdoor environment is taken into account in proposing the corresponding face recognition algorithm. For each case a robust pre-processing algorithm should be designed and which can circumvent a challenging problem in face recognition, namely, different lighting conditions (light intensity, angle of radiation, etc.). In case of indoor environment, faces in an captured image by the robot HD camera are found using a Haar-cascade algorithm. Afterwards, a histogram equalization is applied to face images in order to standardize them. Then commonly practiced Deep convolutional neural network structures such as Inception and ResNet are used to design a model and trained end-to-end on a customized dataset with strong augmentation. Finally, by using a voting method, proper prediction is carried out on each face. In what concerns the outdoor environment, which has more challenges, upon applying histogram Equalization on the captured image, faces are found using a MultiTask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network. Then face images are aligned as head orientation are corrected. Finally, cropped face image is fed to Siamese Network in order to extract face features and verifying individuals. From several practical results it has been inferred that the accuracy of the indoor method is nearly 93% without voting and with voting 97%, and the outdoor method is about 95%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9260698/,2020 28th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE),4-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

Within these frameworks, smart buildings generate large amounts of data from networks of embedded sensors and metering devices which have to be efficiently exploited for real-time decision and control. Lately, increasing attention is being given to black-box models which serve as a suitable alternative to more conventional system identification methods. In this context data-driven methods to derive reliable predictive models are needed on benchmark datasets that enable implementation and validation. We present the application and evaluation of feed-forward auto-regressive neural networks to intelligent load forecasting of smart buildings.

As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for traffic light control in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data.

Drawing from the models of Baron-Cohen (1995) and Leslie (1994), a novel architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid robot. The implemented system determines visual saliency based on inherent object attributes, high-level task constraints, and the attentional states of others. Objects of interest are tracked in real-time to produce motion trajectories which are analyzed by a set of naive physical laws designed to discriminate animate from inanimate movement. Animate objects can be the source of attentional states (detected by finding faces and head orientation) as well as intentional states (determined by motion trajectories between objects). Individual components are evaluated by comparisons to human performance on similar tasks, and the complete system is evaluated in the context of a basic social learning mechanism that allows the robot to mimic observed movements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1223995/,"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.",20-24 July 2003,ieeexplore

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data.

The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation.

An alternate strategy is to learn information about video content using far less compute intensive metadata surrogates. This paper describes a video recommender tool implemented in GovCloud using a novel approach of using lightweight video metadata to learn and classify video content. In contrast to popular video recommender systems that use consumption models for classification, the new approach used in our tool is based solely on the video metadata along with domain expertise used to truth a relatively small subset of relevant video content. The tool is very user-friendly and captures practical knowledge of the user resulting in good learning model. The architecture and implementation specifics of the tool is outlined in this paper. The classifier performance using metadata from tens of thousands of real postings exceeds 90% for both recall and ROC metrics.

Its usefulness has been shown in many real-world application domains, such as social networks and web networks. Directed networks with text associated with each node, such as software package dependency networks, are commonplace.

In this paper, we propose PCTADW-1 and PCTADW-2, two algorithms based on neural networks that learn embeddings of directed networks with text associated with each node. We create two new node-labeled such networks: The package dependency networks in two popular GNU/Linux distributions, Debian and Fedora. We experimentally demonstrate that the embeddings produced by our algorithms resulted in node classification with better quality than those of various baselines on these two networks. We observe that there exist systematic presence of analogies (similar to those in word embeddings) in the network embeddings of software package dependency networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such systematic presence of analogies is observed in network and document embeddings.

10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0048,Learning User Embedding Representation for Gender Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Predicting the gender of users in social media has aroused great interests in recent years. Almost all existing studies rely on the the content features extracted from the main texts like tweets or reviews. It is sometimes difficult to extract content information since many users do not write any posts at all. In this paper, we present a novel framework which uses only the users' ids and their social contexts for gender prediction. The key idea is to represent users in the embedding connection space. A user often has the social context of family members, schoolmates, colleagues, and friends. This is similar to a word and its contexts in documents, which motivates our study. However, when modifying the word embedding technique for user embedding, there are two major challenges. First, unlike the syntax in language, no rule is responsible for the composition of the social contexts. Second, new users were not seen when learning the representations and thus they do not have embedding vectors. Two strategies circular ordering and incremental updating are proposed to solve these problems. We evaluate our methodology on two real data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is significantly better than the traditional graph representation and the state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines.

10.1109/ICDM.2015.10,Learning User Preferences across Multiple Aspects for Merchant Recommendation,IEEE,Conferences,"With the pervasive use of mobile devices, Location Based Social Networks(LBSNs) have emerged in past years. These LBSNs, allowing their users to share personal experiences and opinions on visited merchants, have very rich and useful information which enables a new breed of location-based services, namely, Merchant Recommendation. Existing techniques for merchant recommendation simply treat each merchant as an item and apply conventional recommendation algorithms, e.g., Collaborative Filtering, to recommend merchants to a target user. However, they do not differentiate the user's real preferences on various aspects, and thus can only achieve limited success. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by utilizing and analyzing user reviews to discover user preferences in different aspects. Following the intuition that a user rating represents a personalized rational choice, we propose a novel utility-based approach by combining collaborative and individual views to estimate user preference (i.e., rating). An optimization algorithm based on a Gaussian model is developed to train our merchant recommendation approach. Lastly we evaluate the proposed approach in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and cold-start using two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Log parsing serves as the the first step towards automated log analysis. However, the current log parsing methods are not adaptive. Without intra-service adaptiveness, log parsing cannot handle software/firmware upgrade because learned templates cannot match new type of logs. In addition, without cross-service adaptiveness, the logs of a new type of service cannot be accurately parsed when this service is newly deployed. We propose LogParse, an adaptive log parsing framework, to support intra-service and cross-service incremental template learning and update. LogParse turns the template generation problem into a word classification problem and learns the features of template words and variable words. We evaluate LogParse on four public production log datasets. The results demonstrate that LogParse supports accurate adaptive template update (increased from 0.559 to nearly 1.0 parsing accuracy), and a trained LogParse is adaptive for a brand new service's log parsing.

This can only occur with the applicant's permission. Then, this data is processed using a program that extracts the relevant information segments. Finally, these information segments are evaluated using crowdsourcing. We attempted to evaluate the information segments using social networks. To that end, we automatically posted requests on the social networks regarding certain information segments and evaluated the community response by counting “likes” and “shares”. For example, we posted the status, “Do you think that a person who has worked at ABC Company is more likely to repay a loan? Please “like” this post if you agree.” From the results, we were able to estimate public opinion. Once evaluated, each information segment was then given a weight factor that was optimized using available loan-repay test data provided to us by a company. We then tested the proposed system on a set of 400 applicants. Using a second crowdsourcing approach, we were able to confirm that the resulting solution provided a 92.5% correct assessment, with 6.45% false positives and 11.11% false negatives, with an assessment duration of 24 hours.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6888682/,"15th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)",30 June-2 July 2014,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICODSE.2018.8705834,Microtask Crowdsourcing Marketplace for Social Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Crowdsourcing is a powerful way to process and collect data that needs human's logic and perception. Crowdsourcing can take part in many hard to compute problems such as data entry, multimedia transcriptions and many case of artificial intelligence. While this is a powerful approach, crowdsourcing needs a relatively large marketplace to works optimum. In context of Indonesia, we hardly hear about task crowdsourcing even though there are some marketplace like poin-web.co.id. In this paper, we propose a social network for crowdsourcing marketplace to penetrate the market. People tends to waste most of their time on social network and game rather than other mobile application in case of mobile usage. The idea is to make crowdsourcing as a filler while people are using social networks like waiting for a chat or scrolling the timeline. And by applying microtask as the task, people will not have much burden on doing the task. On the other hand, he/she will get additional income. We implemented LINE as a basis of our social network marketplace. LINE does provide the most interactive way of provide message. Additionally, the user of LINE in Indonesia is growing in a fast pace. We conduct an experiment focused on worker's coverage and ease of use. By using usability testing as a basis of ease of use evaluation, we received good feedbacks as 90.9% of the users feel easier to answer through LINE and is excited to use the platform in case it goes with real money.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8705834/,2018 5th International Conference on Data and Software Engineering (ICoDSE),7-8 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

We can envision a future where a personal conversational agent could migrate across different form factors and environments to always accompany and assist its user to support a far more continuous, personalized and collaborative experience. This opens the question of what properties of a conversational AI agent migrates across forms, and how it would impact user perception. To explore this, we developed a Migratable AI system where a user's information and/or the agent's identity can be preserved as it migrates across form factors to help its user with a task. We validated the system by designing a 2x2 between-subjects study to explore the effects of information migration and identity migration on user perceptions of trust, competence, likeability and social presence. Our results suggest that identity migration had a positive effect on trust, competence and social presence, while information migration had a positive effect on trust, competence and likeability. Overall, users report highest trust, competence, likeability and social presence towards the conversational agent when both identity and information were migrated across embodiments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223436/,2020 29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN),31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

Previous studies have examined how to extract investors' sentiments captured on social media to enhance stock prediction. However, little work was done to leverage public's emotions captured on social media to predict corporate credit risks. Our research fills the current research gap by developing a new computational method to extract public's emotions embedded in social postings to supplement common financial indicators (e.g., return-on-assets) for predicting corporate credit ratings. Grounded in Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions, the proposed computational framework can automatically extract the distribution of eight basic emotions from textual postings on online social media. In particular, one main contribution of our work is the development of the new emotion latent dirichlet allocation (ELDA) model for textual emotion analysis. In addition, we develop an ensemble learning model with random forest (RF) as the basis classifier to improve the performance of corporate credit rating. Based on the real-world data crawled from Twitter, our experimental results confirm that the proposed ELDA model can effectively and efficiently extract public's emotions from social postings to enhance the prediction of corporate credit ratings. To our best knowledge, this is the first successful research of developing a new computational model of extracting public's emotions from social postings to enhance corporate credit risk prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8592626/,2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE),12-14 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

The outbreaks of cascades will often bring influential events, which leads to an open research problem: how to accurately predict the cascading outbreaks in social networks? Although there have been some existing works on cascading outbreak prediction, they ignore the structure information of cascades. In this paper, we propose to use subcascades as features for cascade outbreak prediction.

10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.242,Modeling Curiosity in Virtual Companions to Improve Human Learners' Learning Experience,IEEE,Conferences,"A key design aspect for virtual learning companions is their believability. A lot of attention has been paid to emotion modeling which is at the core of believability. However, most of the existing emotion models neglect the epistemology-based emotions, which are knowledge-related emotions that affect the human learning process. Studies have shown that curiosity is an important epistemology-based emotion that positively influences social learning. Hence, modeling curiosity in learning companions may improve human learners' learning experience in a virtual environment. However, existing curiosity models assume simplified cognitive processes and fail to capture multiple sources of curiosity stimuli. In this paper, we propose a novel model of curiosity for learning companions to capture salient curiosity stimuli through a psychologically inspired approach. Our model is built based on Berlyne's theory and considers three most salient appraisal variables in a virtual learning environment, including novelty, surprise, and uncertainty. The model is built on planbased knowledge representations augmented with planning. Two internal processes are modeled for learning companions to demonstrate curiosity: curiosity appraisal and learning. The proposed model of curiosity is implemented in a learning companion and evaluated through user studies. The evaluation results show that the learning companion's curiosity significantly improves human learners' learning experience from multiple aspects.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7397337/,2015 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT),6-9 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore

The simulation of this multi-agent model is done in NetLogo 4.0.4., which is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural and social phenomena. This environment is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. We will simulate fully and partly connected networks in random and circuit arrangements.

Many real life applications require iterative computations in general and in particular used in most of machine learning and data mining algorithms over large datasets, such as web link structures and social network graphs. MapReduce is a software framework for easily writing applications which process large amount of data (multi-terabyte) in parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware. However, because of batch oriented processing of MapReduce we are unable to utilize the benefits of MapReduce in iterative computations. Our proposed work is mainly focused on optimizing three factors resulting in performance improvement of iterative algorithms in MapReduce environment. In this paper, we address the key issues based on execution of tasks, the unnecessary creation of new task in each iteration and excessive shuffling of data in each iteration.

Organizations not only have to update their software to the latest versions, but do effective patch management and prioritize security-related patching as well. In addition to intelligence sources such as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) alerts, cybersecurity news, national vulnerability database (NBD), and commercial cybersecurity vendors, social media is another valuable source that facilitates early stage intelligence gathering. To early detect future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, we propose a dynamic vulnerability-threat assessment model to predict the tendency to be exploited for vulnerability entries listed in Common Vulnerability Exposures, and also to analyze social media contents such as Twitter to extract meaningful information. The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet. When applied to predict the vulnerabilities exploitation and analyzed the real-world social media discussion data, it showed promising prediction accuracy with purified social media intelligence.

The problem is alleviated by retraining the model with new instances (and applying weights) in order to reduce the effects of concept drift.

10.1109/RACSS.2012.6212691,MuGRAM: An approach for multi-labelled graph matching,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph mining has been a widely studied domain over the years. Graph representation of real world problems has enabled the development of simple solutions bringing in better clarity. Graph mining has various sub domains among which graph matching is a prominent one having a number of algorithms. With the rise of new applications involving large sets of networked data, the performance of these algorithms has become important. The graph based representations for social networks and communication networks have led to the evolution of multi-labelled large graphs which are still not completely handled by the existing algorithms. The requirement of a fast and efficient indexing process so as to accommodate dynamic graphs without having to opt for incremental indexing is another major challenge. In this paper, we propose MuGRAM - a multi-labelled graph matching approach aimed at addressing the above mentioned issues. This approach is capable of handling multiple labels for vertices as well as edges of reference graphs. An enhanced indexing method proposed in the paper ensures a fast indexing process. A breadth first search oriented spanning tree along with a novel technique for neighbourhood matching ensures fast query processing.

In addition, complex objects can be composed of multiple modalities, e.g. a post on social media may contain both texts and images. Previous approaches typically treat every modality as a whole, while it is not the case in real world, as every post may contain multiple images and texts with quite diverse semantic meanings. Therefore, Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label (M3) learning was proposed. Previous attempt at M3 learning argues that exploiting label correlations is crucial. In this paper, we find that we can handle M3 problems using graph convolutional network. Specifically, a graph is built over all labels and each label is initially represented by its word embedding. The main goal for GCN is to map those label embed dings into inter-correlated label classifiers. Moreover, multi-instance aggregation is based on attention mechanism, making it more interpretable because it naturally learns to discover which pattern triggers the labels.

It is widely used in topic discovery, information retrieval, and document modeling. In recent years, with the advancement of research about neural networks, topic models using neural networks, such as NVLDA and ProdLDA, have been presented. Since it is easy to use accelerators such as GPUs for training these, topic modeling for large corpora can be done efficiently. Topic models are also used for short texts such as social networking sites and product reviews, where the number of words in a document is often short. This means that the co-occurrence information of words is also extremely less, and it is difficult to infer latent topics for easy understanding by humans when training with only the target corpus. In this paper, we investigated whether trained word embedding vectors on other large corpora such as Wikipedia compensate for the lack of word information in short texts. While previous studies have been conducted on long texts such as newspaper articles, we specifically checked the effect on short texts. As a result, we confirmed that under many conditions, Topic Coherence evaluation using Wikipedia was improved by using word embedding.

IoT is among the latest ICT developments that is making the boundaries between reality and fiction vanish. According to Mark Weiser, “…The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it”<sup>i</sup>. And according to Gartner<sup>ii</sup>, 6.4 billion connected things were in use in 2016, up 3% from 2015, and will reach 20.8 billion by 2020. In the first initiative, we adopt storytelling principles to design and develop Process of Things (PoT). A PoT is specified as a story whose script indicates the characters that things will play as well as the scenes that will feature these things. A PoT also allows things to collaborate by offering value-added services to end-users. A system implementing PoT will be presented during the talk. In the second initiative, we shed the light on some obstacles that are slowing downIoTexpansion and adoption, for instance diversity of things' development technologies and communication standards, users' reluctance and sometimes rejection due to privacy invasion, lack of killer applications that would demonstrate their necessity, lack of an IoT-oriented software engineering discipline, and finally, the passive nature of things. Because of this nature, things are restricted to sending data to third parties or (basic) processing data prior to their transfer to third parties, too. We are examining how to empower things with additional capabilities that would make them proactive. This means that things can for instance, reach out to peers that expose collaborative attitude, form dynamic communities when necessary, avoid peers that expose malicious attitude, be accountable for their actions, etc. While we already see some encouraging signs of thing empowerment through initiatives like semantic things, Internet of social things, Internet of agents, and agents of things, we propose the agentification of things from a conceptual perspective exemplified with norms and an operational perspective exemplified with commitments. In conjunction with thing agentification, we present during the talk the third initiative that examines thing mutation in the sense that things will bind and/or unbind capabilities on the fly (and as they see fit). To ensure mutation success we consider first, the context in which things operate and second, policies that impact things' decisions to bind/unbind capabilities. We motivate mutation decisions with 3 factors: performance so that a thing remains competitive/attractive, adaptation so that a thing remains responsive, and survivability so that a thing remains in business.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8285967/,2017 International Conference on Infocom Technologies and Unmanned Systems (Trends and Future Directions) (ICTUS),18-20 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/AiDAS53897.2021.9574386,Online Shopping Preferences Visualization System Using Web Content Mining,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently, social media sites have been attracting people to start and operate online business. It has been gaining more attention especially during this COVID-19 pandemic, where most activities are conducted via online platform. For instance, Instagram is one of the social media platform where people share and post their pictures and videos on their account, but some people take this opportunity to promote their business and shop online via features provided by Instagram. Based on observation, there is no specific function that visualizes the information of Instagram's business accounts to help people in gaining information and making decisions during shopping process. Thus, a system that specifically visualizes Instagram's extracted data was developed using Web Content Mining technique with the assistance of hashtags as data-points and Phantombuster API. Tableau software integrated with JavaScript library is used as a visualization tool to display the users shopping activities. The result of the extracted data was visualized in the form of Bubble Chart, Bar Chart, and Multiple Bar Chart that were placed in different dashboards. The results from the obtained functional testing and users' feedbacks have indicated 64.3% of the respondents agreed that the proposed system helps users in making the right choice during online shopping. However, this system has some limitation that could be further enhanced such as updating the information automatically in real time without using any manpower and to increase the interactivity between system and user instead of using static visualization graphs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9574386/,2021 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences (AiDAS),8-9 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

In this context, online subspace learning algorithms that aim at retrieving low-rank representations of data constitute a mainstay in many applications. Working with incomplete (partially observed) data has recently become commonplace. Moreover, the knowledge of the real rank of the sought subspace is rarely at our disposal a priori. Herein, a novel low-rank subspace learning algorithm from incomplete data is presented. Its main premise is the online processing of incomplete data along with the imposition of low-rankness on the sought subspace via a sophisticated utilization of the group sparsity inducing ℓ<sub>2</sub>/ℓ<sub>1</sub> norm.

The study of the integration of these terms can be a significant step to avoid congestion and (Users') rejection in the network. Integration of Traffic Control Terms (TCT) between LinkedIn and other social networks is one of the best solutions to establish consequent traffic flow out of the network. Depending on the conditions, integration can be done in different ways. This article examines the direct pass and indirect pass methods. Node phase differences are key elements for integration of LinkedIn considered in this review. To calculate the optimal phasing and appropriate phase difference, first the status of a user in LinkedIn has been analyzed using software, and then the results have been simulated by charting. In this article, the Integration of TCT was done based on evaluation of the TCT performance through determining the appropriate phase differences and reference rule and calculating the measurement of Latency (LT) in the main network port. This latency was calculated as the difference of the expected time and real time of connection or login to the network in simulated conditions. The achieved results indicate that in unsaturated conditions using indirect pass method and in saturated conditions, due to rejection of user and inability of network TCT, using indirect pass method is the best choice for integration of the TCT for LinkedIn and other social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6836746/,8th International Conference on e-Commerce in Developing Countries: With Focus on e-Trust,24-25 April 2014,ieeexplore

10.23919/ICMU48249.2019.9006662,PBEM: A Pattern-Based Embedding Model for User Location Category Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rapid popularity of mobile devices, a vast amount of trajectory-based check-in data are shared in many social network applications, which is an important data source for user location prediction. The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of PBEM on two real-life trajectory-based check-in datasets.

And GCN has been gaining popularity due to its success in real-world applications such as recommendation, natural language processing, etc. Because neural network and graph propagation have high computation complexity, GPUs have been introduced to both neural network training and graph processing. However, it is notoriously difficult to perform efficient GCN computing on data parallel hardware like GPU due to the sparsity and irregularity in graphs. In this paper, we present PCGCN, a novel and general method to accelerate GCN computing by taking advantage of the locality in graphs. We experimentally demonstrate that real-world graphs usually have the clustering property that can be used to enhance the data locality in GCN computing. Then, PCGCN proposes to partition the whole graph into chunks according to locality and process subgraphs with a dual-mode computing strategy which includes a selective and a full processing methods for sparse and dense subgraphs, respectively.

More and more passenger enjoy the drop-off service. In practice, we find an interesting question: if a passenger has ever choice the drop-off service, whether they are willing to recommend this service to other traveler? Although the acknowledgment that social learning is related to travel decision is promoted, quantitative analysis about how social learning shape and impact the decision of passengers is still limited. We study and estimate a diffusion probability between different passengers by proposing a CCM (Co-travel Link Cascade Model) based on a modified EM iterative algorithm. Then, we segment passengers into three types (Influenced, Unchecked and Immune). The three types of passengers are predicated by approaches of IC-like model, Random Forest model and probabilistic model, respectively.

As opposed to using a multi-class counting approach, this paper aggregates CSI for the occupancies below and above a COVID-Safe limit. We show that this binary classification approach to the COVID safe decision problem has similar or better accuracy outcomes with much lower computational complexity, allowing for real-world implementation on IoT embedded devices.

Our initial focus is to analyze Twitter as it is one of the most popular social media services. Phishers on Twitter curate tweets that lead users to websites that download malware. This is a major issue as phishers can then gain access to the user's digital identity and perform malicious acts. Phishing attacks have the potential to be similar in different regions, perhaps at different times. We have developed a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, which we call Pelican, that detects potential phishing attacks in real-time on Twitter. Pelican can be used for early detection of potential phishing attacks and is able to detect potential new attacks without pre-existing assumptions about the type of data or understanding of the characteristics of the attacks. The technique uses ensembles and sampling methods to handle class imbalances in real-world applications. The technique continuously detects unusual behaviour or changes in Twitter. We have investigated changes in trends across Twitter to detect changes in online behaviour of potential phishing links. The technique uses a change detector that enables automatic retraining when there is unusual behaviour detected. Pelican is a novel technique that adapts to changes within phishing attacks in real-time.

Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic.

10.1109/eCrime.2012.6489521,PhishAri: Automatic realtime phishing detection on twitter,IEEE,Conferences,"With the advent of online social media, phishers have started using social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare to spread phishing scams. Twitter is an immensely popular micro-blogging network where people post short messages of 140 characters called tweets. It has over 100 million active users who post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started using Twitter as a medium to spread phishing because of this vast information dissemination. Further, it is difficult to detect phishing on Twitter unlike emails because of the quick spread of phishing links in the network, short size of the content, and use of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri, detects phishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific features along with URL features to detect whether a tweet posted with a URL is phishing or not. Some of the Twitter specific features we use are tweet content and its characteristics like length, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features used are the characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as age of the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee ratio. These twitter specific features coupled with URL based features prove to be a strong mechanism to detect phishing tweets. We use machine learning classification techniques and detect phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52%. We have deployed our system for end-users by providing an easy to use Chrome browser extension. The extension works in realtime and classifies a tweet as phishing or safe. In this research, we show that we are able to detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high accuracy which is much faster than public blacklists and as well as Twitter's own defense mechanism to detect malicious content. We also performed a quick user evaluation of PhishAri in a laboratory study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of PhishAri and showed that users like and find it convenient to use PhishAri in real-world.

While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details.

Existing prediction models have some shortages, such as simple process of influencing factors of trust and low prediction precision. To address these problems, a prediction model based on Soft-Voting ensemble learning was proposed. Firstly, features of influencing factors of information propagation in social commerce were constructed from user attributes, information text and user interaction. Secondly, XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost models were trained according to the above constructed features to predict trust propagation in social commerce. Finally, results of XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost models were integrated using Soft-Voting technique as the final prediction results. An experiment on a real dataset of Sina Weibo was carried out, which proved the higher precision of Soft-Voting ensemble learning compared to those of XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9403760/,2020 International Conference on Big Data & Artificial Intelligence & Software Engineering (ICBASE),30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

Psychologists and sociologists continue to probe downturns influence of economic crisis on mental health and propose social protection programs to promote recovery. The problem, however, is that more than having a social recovery program, it requires personal level efforts to realize and understand what may be coming ahead and rationally solving it, by being more in control of the situation. Considering this context, there are various aims of this paper to evaluate theoretical as well as conceptual illustrations on the reasons behind the negative associations of an economic downturn on population's mental stability, followed by closely examining critical mental distress factors as well as economic distress factors and establishing connection through literature analysis. The study proposes a framework to intelligently detect economic distress in real time and successfully link it with human distress factors to predict any anticipated alleviation in stress level.

10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0020,Preference-Like Score to Cope with Cold-Start User in Recommender Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, there has been an explosion of social recommender systems (SRS) research. However, the dominant trend of these studies has been towards designing new prediction models. The typical approach is to use social information to build those models for each new user. Due to the inherent complexity of this prediction process, for full cold-start user in particular, the performance of most SRS fall a great deal. We, rather, propose that new users are best served by models already built in system. Selecting a prediction model from a set of strong linked users might offer better results than building a personalized model for full cold-start users. We contribute to this line of work comparing several matrix factorization based SRS under full cold-start user scenario, and proposing a general model selection approach, called ToSocialRec, that leverages existing recommendation models to offer items for new users. Our framework is not only able to handle several social network connection weight metrics, but any metric that can be correlated with preference similarity among users, named here as Preference-like score. We perform experiments on real life datasets that show this technique is as efficient or more than current state-of-the-art techniques for cold-start user.

Real world environments are complex, dynamic, and uncertain. Human-Robot interactions can be unstructured and unanticipated. In addition, when the robot is intended to be a shared public resource, management issues such as user access and user privacy arise, leading to design choices that can impact on users' trust and the adoption of the designed system. In this paper we propose a user registration and login system for a social robot and report on people's preferences when registering their personal details with the robot to access services. This study is the first iteration of a larger body of work investigating potential use cases for the Pepper social robot at a government managed centre for startups and innovation. We prototyped and deployed a system for user registration with the robot, which gives users control over registering and accessing services with either face recognition technology or a QR code.

The contents can be requested from the proximity users via Device-to-device (D2D) communications while proactive caching the popular content to local users. However, the assumptions that content popularity is equal to user preference in several existing studies, which are invalid and not rigorous due to the fact that content popularity is calculated by the statistic of user requests within a certain period while user preference reflects the probability of a content requested by the individual user. Motivated by this, in this paper, we study the edge caching optimization of hierarchical wireless networks. Our aiming is to maximize the size of content offload by D2D communications. In particular, the edge caching policy with D2D sharing model based on the analysis of user mobility and social relationship is derived.

Though well trained clinicians, medical and psychological treatments are available for depression treatment, persons or families are reluctant to speak out/reach doctors about this disorder for various social reasons. Diagnosis of depression disorder includes numerous interviews with patient and family, clinical analysis, questionnaires which is time consuming and also demands well trained clinicians. In the present era of Machine learning, automation of depression detection is not complicated and can easily be deployed. However, the automation should use fewer resources, provide accurate results with more reachability.

Most of the efficient IPS methods utilize radio-based solutions to meet the accuracy requirement of indoor LBS. Typically fingerprinting localization is realized, which requires a site survey process where radio signatures of a localization area are annotated with their actual recorded locations. The site survey is time-consuming and labor-intensive that intensifies practical limits and challenges in realizing a reliable and scalable IPS.

In particular, we suggest combining access point (AP) proximity information and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to collect labeled data without any human intervention. The crowdsourced training data are fed to model a Gaussian process, which predicts the mean RSS and its corresponding variance across the testbed. To validate the proposed method, we compared the predicted data with the manually measured one and utilized the predicted data for localization using weighted k-nearest neighbor (Wk-NN) and maximum likelihood (ML) based fingerprinting localization.

Motivated by the great power of Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), many current researches adopt GNN-based detectors to reveal the anomalous users.

In this paper, we propose an innovate Relevance-aware Anomalous Users Detection model (RAU-GNN) to obtain a fine-grained detection result. RAU-GNN first extracts multiple relations of all types of users in social network, including both benign and anomalous users, and accordingly constructs the multiple user relation graph.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/AIID51893.2021.9456477,Research on Privacy Protection Technology in Face Identity Authentication System Based on Edge Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"In today's society, the rapid development of the Internet makes People's Daily life become more intelligent and diversified. Today's society has entered a multifaceted era where everything is interconnected. Artificial intelligence technology is gradually replacing some traditional human services, such as intelligent robot customer service instead of traditional human customer service, intelligent face scanning security check in railway stations instead of traditional manual ticket checking, unmanned supermarket automatic checkout has liberated some social labor costs. All these changes are the result of the development of artificial intelligence technology in today's society. In recent years, unicorn startups focused on biometrics have sprung up all around us, such as BTU and its MEG VII (Face ++). Thanks to the development of Internet and artificial intelligence technology, in many application fields, the traditional access control and identity authentication technology based on password verification is gradually transforming to the scheme based on biometric identification verification. Secure identity authentication is very important to the application of Internet. Face recognition is the most popular technology among all biometric identification technologies. In the field of biometric identification technology, it has become the most widely used technology in the field of identity authentication because of its unique non-invasive, support for infrared and visible light, no need for user cooperation and many other advantages. In the field of education, examinee identification, pedestrian identification detection at the entrance of railway stations, face electronic payment, intelligent video surveillance system, intelligent attendance and access control system, intelligent unmanned supermarkets and customs clearance ports become the pioneer fields of face recognition applications. It can be seen that the era of “national face brushing” has arrived, and the application of face recognition technology will only be more and more widespread in the current era and in the future. However, due to the sensitivity of biometric data and the heterogeneity and openness of network environment, the privacy leakage of biometric data is difficult to avoid. At present, fog computing and edge computing have been paid more and more attention in many fields. In the case that cloud service providers are unable to provide sufficient security, edge computing shows its advantages. In this paper, mobile edge computing is introduced for the first time into the face privacy protection identity authentication system based on cloud server outsourcing computing. It can not only greatly reduce the interaction frequency between users and cloud server, improve the availability and fault tolerance of the system, but also contribute to the implementation of privacy protection scheme. A deep constitutional neural network for face feature extraction is trained using deep learning framework Cafe. Cosine similarity is used to complete face verification. A privacy protection scheme based on the secure nearest neighbor algorithm is proposed, which can not only protect the security of the face feature data at the edge computing node, but also allow the edge computing node to complete the face recognition operation against the encrypted face feature data. In addition, the encryption scheme does not require large computing resources, and the accuracy of face recognition in cipher text is exactly the same as that in explain. At present, most of the solutions either have high computational complexity or poor security performance. How to reduce the computational complexity and improve the real-time performance of the system while ensuring the high security of the private data has important research significance and value. Therefore, in the cloud server outsourcing computing environment, how to complete biometric identification on the premise of protecting the privacy of biological data has become a research hot spot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9456477/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Design (AIID),28-30 May 2021,ieeexplore

For robots intended to be embedded in a social environment, the adaptability of behaviour is an important factor. Research of human decision behaviour shows, that emotions play a decisive role, even for learning and reversal learning. In this paper, improvements and further results of a previously presented framework for decision making based on an emotional memory are presented. The improvements include the reduction of the amount of previous knowledge that has to be implemented and an evaluation concerning reversal learning. For evaluation purposes, a typical reversal learning task, performed by real subjects, has been used.

While research on social navigation has focused mainly on the scalability with the number of pedestrians in open spaces, typical indoor environments present the additional challenge of constrained spaces such as corridors and doorways that limit maneuverability and influence patterns of pedestrian interaction. We present an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) to learn policies capable of dynamic adaptation to the presence of moving pedestrians while navigating between desired locations in constrained environments. The policy network receives guidance from a motion planner that provides waypoints to follow a globally planned trajectory, whereas RL handles the local interactions. We explore a compositional principle for multi-layout training and find that policies trained in a small set of geometrically simple layouts successfully generalize to more complex unseen layouts that exhibit composition of the structural elements available during training. Going beyond walls-world like domains, we show transfer of the learned policy to unseen 3D reconstructions of two real environments. These results support the applicability of the compositional principle to navigation in real-world buildings and indicate promising usage of multi-agent simulation within reconstructed environments for tasks that involve interaction. https://ai.stanford.edu/∼cdarpino/socialnavconstrained/",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560893/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),30 May-5 June 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/SNPD.2017.8022736,Routing algorithm based on ant colony optimization for mobile social network,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile social network (MSN) is a type of delay tolerant network explicitly considering social characteristics of the terminal nodes. The existing Ad Hoc routing protocols assume that there is at least one complete communication path between the source node and the target node. So they cannot be applied to MSN directly. The key to solve the problem of content distribution in mobile social network is how to transmit the data to the target node in the case of there is no complete communication path between the source node and the target node. As the routing algorithm based on ant colony optimization has great ability to adapt it, it is an effective method to deal with the dynamic topologies of MSN. Based on the social network characteristics of MSN, this paper proposes a new MSN routing algorithm ACOMSN based on ant colony optimization. The algorithm uses the method of processing the node information on the transmission path to get the information list between the node pairs, so as to select the appropriate relay node to provide effective information when forwarding data to other nodes. In addition, ACOMSN designs methodologies for pheromone updating and data forwarding.

Because of the sheer size and complexity of problem tickets, supervised learning algorithms have been the method of choice for problem ticket classification, relying on labeled (or pre-classified) tickets from one managed infrastructure to automatically create signatures for similar infrastructures. However, where there are insufficient preclassified data, leveraging human expertise to develop classification rules can be more efficient. In this paper, we describe a rule-based crowdsourcing approach, where experts can author classification rules and a social networking-based platform (called xPad) is used to socialize and execute these rules by large practitioner communities.

This will improve transportation efficiency and public safety. However, social networking exposes vehicles to different kinds of cyber-attacks. This concern can be addressed through an efficient and secure key management framework. This study presents a Secure and Transparent Public-key Management (ST-PKMS) based on blockchain and notary system, but it addresses security and privacy challenges specific to VSNs. ST-PKMS significantly enhances the efficiency and trustworthiness of mutual authentication. In ST-PKMS, each vehicle has multiple short-lived anonymous public-keys, which are recorded on the blockchain platform. However, public-keys get activated only when a notary system notarizes it, and clients accept only notarized public-keys during mutual authentication. Compromised vehicles can be effectively removed from the VSNs by blocking notarization of their public-keys; thus, the need to distribute Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is eliminated in the proposed scheme.

However, when it comes to purchasing, selling and renting processes of real estate, there are many factors that play a vital role in an individual's decision making. In this paper, we consider the social factors that affect the real estate investment and find the top significant attributes that have a major influence on investment market. We use Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs), Linear Regression(LR) and Weighted Sum Model (WSM) for this purpose, also providing hypothesis testing on the probability distributions of the obtained attributes. The designed algorithm provides an automated means for the study of behavioral economics towards real estate investment.

Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, leveraging the power of peer influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers.

This research aims at providing a way to increase user satisfaction at the events they attend from the event based social network. Two approaches are explained and used to determine the user's interests from the events they have attended and also through the sentiment analysis of the reviews they have given for these events. A profile specific to each user is developed to support event recommendations to users in the system based on a matching profile and a set of at least K friends on the social network. The paper uses content-based filtering by using the events details to make recommendations and collaborative filtering to find users who have similar interests. Lastly the sentiment of event reviews is determined to gain an understanding about how users feel about the events they attended. This sentiment data is integrated into the recommendation of events.

Current social recommendation methods commonly apply the Matrix Factorization (MF) model to incorporate social information into the recommendation process. As an alternative model to MF, we propose a novel social recommendation approach based on Euclidean Embedding (SREE) in this paper.

In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning.

During the testing process, the faults which causes failure are detected and removed. One common assumption of many traditional SRGMs is that the fault removal rate is constant. In practical, the fault removal rate increases with time as learning and maturity of software engineer increases. Hence, time variant fault removal rate has been considered in this study. A complex software system may contain different category of faults. Some of faults can be easily detected and removed and some of faults required more effort to be detected and removed. Therefore, in this article, a NHPP based SRGM has been proposed which incorporates mainly two type of faults, major and minor.

However, the solutions have largely exploited only information available in the mentions and employed a single matching technique. We show how to exploit information about data sources to significantly improve matching accuracy. In particular, we observe that different sources often vary substantially in their level of semantic ambiguity, thus requiring different matching techniques. In addition, it is often beneficial to group and match mentions in related sources first, before considering other sources. These observations lead to a large space of matching strategies, analogous to the space of query evaluation plans considered by a relational optimizer. We propose viewing entity matching as a composition of basic steps into a ""match execution plan"". We analyze formal properties of the plan space, and show how to find a good match plan. To do so, we employ ideas from social network analysis to infer the ambiguity and related-ness of data sources. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world data sets on the Web and in the domain of personal information management (PIM).

In order to provide Quality of Experience (QoE) support for mobile OSN services, in this paper we propose a socially-driven learning-based framework, namely Spice, for media content prefetching to reduce the access delay and enhance mobile user's satisfaction. Through a large-scale data-driven analysis over real-life mobile Twitter traces from over 17,000 users during a period of five months, we reveal that the social friendship has a great impact on user's media content click behavior. To capture this effect, we conduct social friendship clustering over the set of user's friends, and then develop a cluster-based Latent Bias Model for socially-driven learning-based prefetching prediction. We then propose a usage-adaptive prefetching scheduling scheme by taking into account that different users may possess heterogeneous patterns in the mobile OSN app usage. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of Spice framework using trace-driven emulations on smartphones. Evaluation results corroborate that the Spice can achieve superior performance, with an average 67.2% access delay reduction at the low cost of cellular data and energy consumption. Furthermore, by enabling users to offload their machine learning procedures to a cloud server, our design can achieve speed-up of a factor of 1000 over the local data training execution on smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7524568/,IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications,10-14 April 2016,ieeexplore

With important discoveries made by adversarial learning research, surprisingly little attention, however, has been paid to the real-world adversarial techniques deployed by the cybercriminal to evade image-based detection. Unlike the adversarial examples that induce misclassification using nearly imperceivable perturbation, real-world adversarial images tend to be less optimal yet equally effective. As a first step to understand the threat, we report in the paper a study on adversarial promotional porn images (APPIs) that are extensively used in underground advertising. We show that the adversary today's strategically constructs the APPIs to evade explicit content detection while still preserving their sexual appeal, even though the distortions and noise introduced are clearly observable to humans. To understand such real-world adversarial images and the underground business behind them, we develop a novel DP-based methodology called Male`na, which focuses on the regions of an image where sexual content is least obfuscated and therefore visible to the target audience of a promotion. Using this technique, we have discovered over 4,000 APPIs from 4,042,690 images crawled from popular social media, and further brought to light the unique techniques they use to evade popular explicit content detectors (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API, Yahoo Open NSFW model), and the reason that these techniques work. Also studied are the ecosystem of such illicit promotions, including the obfuscated contacts advertised through those images, compromised accounts used to disseminate them, and large APPI campaigns involving thousands of images. Another interesting finding is the apparent attempt made by cybercriminals to steal others' images for their advertising.

Online social networks (OSNs), due to their fat user base and open access nature are also prone to such attacks. Current state-of-art algorithms for sybil attack detection make use of the inherent social graph created among registered users of OSN service. They rely on the inherent trust relationship among these users. No effort is made to combine other characteristic behavior of sybil users with properties of social graph of OSNs to improve detection accuracy of sybil attacks. Sybil identities are also used as gateways for spreading spam content in OSNs. The proposed approach exploits this behavior of sybil users to improve detection accuracy of existing sybil detection algorithms. In the proposed approach, content generated/published by each user is used along with the topological properties of the social graph of registered users. A machine learning model is used for assigning a fractional value called ""trust value"" which denotes the amount of legitimate content generated by the user. A modification to sybil detection algorithm is proposed which makes use of the trust value of each user to improve the accuracy of detecting a sybil identity. Real dataset from Facebook is crawled and used for analysis and experiments. Analytical results show the superiority of proposed solution. Results are compared with SybilGuard and SybilShield which shows ~14% decrease in false positive rates with very minimal effect on acceptance rate or false negative rate of the sybil detection algorithms.

10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057066,SybilSCAR: Sybil detection in online social networks via local rule based propagation,IEEE,Conferences,"Detecting Sybils in online social networks (OSNs) is a fundamental security research problem as adversaries can leverage Sybils to perform various malicious activities. Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into two categories: Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and they cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a new structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in OSNs. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with a state-of-the-art RW-based method and a state-of-the-art LBP-based method, using both synthetic Sybils and large-scale social network datasets with real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that SybilSCAR is more accurate and more robust to label noise than the compared state-of-the-art RW-based method, and that SybilSCAR is orders of magnitude more scalable than the state-of-the-art LBP-based method and is guaranteed to converge.

State-of-the-art in the defense mechanisms includes Automated Turing Tests (ATTs such as CAPTCHAs) and graph-based Sybil detectors. Sybil detectors in social networks leverage the assumption that Sybils will find it hard to befriend real users which leads to Sybils being connected to each other forming strongly connected sub graphs that can be detected using graph theory.

In order to build and evaluate our classifier, we collect and manually label a dataset of twitter accounts, including human users, bots, and hybrid (i.e., Tweets are posted by both human and bots). We believe this Twitter Sybils corpus will help researchers in conducting sound measurement studies. We also develop a browser plug-in (that we call Twitter Sybils Detector or TSD for short) that utilizes our classifier and warns the user about possible Sybil accounts before accessing them, upon clicking on a Twitter account.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7033160/,2014 13th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications,3-6 Dec. 2014,ieeexplore

State-of-the-art TCF methods employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model such aspects. These methods deploy matrix-factorization-based (MF -based) approaches to learn the user and item representations. Recently, graph-neural-network-based (GNN-based) approaches have shown improved performance in providing accurate recommendations over traditional MF -based approaches in non-temporal CF settings. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TCF method that leverages GNNs to learn user and item representations, and RNNs to model their temporal dynamics. A challenge with this method lies in the increased data sparsity, which negatively impacts obtaining meaningful quality representations with GNNs. To overcome this challenge, we train a GNN model at each time step using a set of observed interactions accumulated time-wise. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data show the improved performance obtained by our method over several state-of-the-art temporal and non-temporal CF models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413200/,2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10-15 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207151,Temporal Fusion Pointer network-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Multi-Objective Workflow Scheduling in the cloud,IEEE,Conferences,"Cloud computing is emerging as a deployment promising environment for hosting exponentially increasing scientific and social media applications, but how to manage and execute these applications efficiently depends mainly on workflow scheduling. However, scheduling workflows in the cloud is an NP-hard problem and its existing solutions have certain limitations when applied to real-world scenarios. In this paper, a Temporal Fusion Pointer network-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for multi-objective workflow scheduling (TFP-RL) is proposed. Through adopting reinforcement learning, our algorithm can discover its heuristics over time by continuous learning according to the rewards resulting from good scheduling solutions. To make more comprehensive scheduling decisions as the influence of historical actions, a novel temporal fusion pointer network (TFP) is designed for the reinforcement learning agent, which can improve the quality of our resulting solutions and the ability of our algorithm in dealing with versatile workflow applications. To decrease convergence time, we train the proposed TFP-RL model independently by the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic method and use its resulting model for scheduling workflows. Finally, under a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, a Pareto dominance-oriented criterion for reasonable action selection is established for a multi-objective optimization scenario. We first train our TFP-RL model by taking randomly generated workflows as inputs to validate its effectiveness in scheduling, then compare our trained model with other existing scheduling approaches through practical compute- and data-intensive workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarking ones in terms of different metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207151/,2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),19-24 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICARSC.2015.19,Testing a Fully Autonomous Robotic Salesman in Real Scenarios,IEEE,Conferences,"Over the past decades, the number of robots deployed in museums, trade shows and exhibitions have grown steadily. This new application domain has become a key research topic in the robotics community. Therefore, new robots are designed to interact with people in these domains, using natural and intuitive channels. Visual perception and speech processing have to be considered for these robots, as they should be able to detect people in their environment, recognize their degree of accessibility and engage them in social conversations. They also need to safely navigate around dynamic, uncontrolled environments. They must be equipped with planning and learning components, that allow them to adapt to different scenarios. Finally, they must attract the attention of the people, be kind and safe to interact with. In this paper, we describe our experience with Gualzru, a salesman robot endowed with the cognitive architecture RoboCog. This architecture synchronizes all previous processes in a social robot, using a common inner representation as the core of the system.

To achieve the goal of supporting and realizing such object collaboration and adaptation in the object-oriented technology, especially in Java, a new adaptive role-based model Epsilon and a corresponding language EpsilonJ have been proposed. In this paper, we present the background of adaptive role-based models, and then focus on the design of this Epsilon model and its language. A program written in EpsilonJ must be translated into executable code to execute. We propose a translation scheme of mapping EpsilonJ syntax to the standard Java. With this translation scheme, we implemented a practical syntax translator as a preprocessor of EpsilonJ program, through lexical analysis and parsing. To utilize this translator, we also propose an interactive framework prototype for EpsilonJ program development and execution, and developed as a web-based application tool, by deploying this EpsilonJ translator as a core component. Evaluation shows that our translator can effectively perform transformation in high accuracy, and translated programs can be executed more efficiently than the existing implementation of EpsilonJ.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4617382/,"2008 Ninth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing",6-8 Aug. 2008,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109799,The power of cognitive computing: An example of cognitive dynamic regional development modeling,IEEE,Conferences,"This presentation concerns some idea of what could be done, in the author's view, to help make Wang's cognitive informatics a powerful and viable source of tools and techniques for solving various real life problems. First, we give a brief account of cognitive informatics meant as a multidisciplinary field within informatics, or computer science, that is based on results of cognitive and information sciences, and which deals with human information processing mechanisms and processes and their decision theoretic, engineering, etc. applications in broadly perceived computing. We focus on its purpose, i.e. to develop and implement technologies to facilitate and extend the information acquisition, comprehension and processing capacity of humans. Emphasis is on underlying processes in the brain. However, we advocate an extended approach in which though the very cognitive informatics is the foundation, as those processes in the brain are crucial, some sort of an “outer” cognitive informatics is needed which explicitly makes reference not what proceeds “internally” in the brain, because we do not “see” this, but “externally”, i.e. what people can see, judge, evaluate, etc., and what is clearly a result of cognitive information specific processes in the brain. This line of reasoning is in line with the very essence of comprehension, memorizing, learning, choice and decision making, satisfaction with partial truth, allowing for not perfect solutions, etc. dealt with using tools and techniques derived from many areas like psychology, behavioral science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroeconomics etc. In our case, we will concentrate on some cognitive informatics type elements that mostly have been inspired by psychology and behavioral sciences, as our problem is inherently related to human judgments and perceptions, but we will mentioned some inspirations from neuroscience, notably along the lines of neuroeconomics. Cognitive informatics constitutes a foundation of its related new field, cognitive computing, which is basically a new direction in broadly perceived intelligent computing and systems that synergistically combines results from many areas, e.g., information science, computational sciences, computer science, artificial and computational intelligence, cybernetics, systems science, cognitive science, (neuro)psychology, brain science, linguistics, etc. to just mention a few. We try to show on an example of a dynamic systems modeling, more specifically scenario based regional development planning, that cognitive computing can provide new conceptual and implementation vistas. Basically, we consider a region that is characterized by 7 life quality indicators related to economic, social, environmental, etc. qualities, which evolve over some planning horizon due to some investments, mostly by some regional or governmental agencies. There are some scenarios of investment levels over the planning horizon, meant for the development of the particular life quality indexes, and some desired levels of these indexes, both objective, i.e. set by authorities, and subjective, i.e. perceived by the inhabitant groups. As a result of a particular investment scenario, the life quality indexes evolve over the planning horizon, and their temporal evolution is evaluated by the authorities and inhabitants. This evaluation has both an objective, i.e. against the “officially” set thresholds, and subjective, i.e. as perceived by various humans and their groups. Basically, we employ Kacprzyk's fuzzy dynamic programming based approach to the modeling and planning/programming of sustainable regional development, with soft constraints and goals, but we advocated a more sophisticated assessment of variability, stability, balancedness of consecutive investments. In this process we try to develop evaluation measures, and then the optimization type model using concepts that can be effectively and efficiently handled by cognitive computing, notably the inclusion of the so called decision making and behavioral biases, biases in probability and belief, social biases, memory errors, etc. Moreover, we strongly reflect the so called status quo and minimal change biases. By using many results from social sciences, psychology, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, etc. on human judgments and human centric evaluations, we augment a traditional purely effectiveness and efficiency oriented analysis by a more sophisticated analysis of effects of variability of temporal evolution of some life quality indicators on the human perception of its goodness. The model presented, which has been employed for years as part of large mathematical modeling projects for sustainable regional development in many regions in Asia and Europe, is illustrated on an example with scenario analysis for a rural region plagued by social and economic difficulties in which subsidies should properly be distributed over time to obtain a best overall socioeconomic effect. In this talk we present the model in a different perspective, based first on the basic Wang's cognitive informatics and its Wang and Ruhe's decision making application, and then based on new, more comprehensive cognitive computing. We show that this provides a novel insight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8109799/,2017 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),26-28 July 2017,ieeexplore

In the previous literature, the dynamics of both network structure and user generated content are rarely considered. Our investigation of the available timing information from a real-world network demonstrates that time delay has significant impact on reciprocity formation. In particular, we find structural factors possess greater effect on short-term reciprocity while factors based on user generated content become more important for long-term reciprocity. Based on the empirical analysis, we redefine the reciprocity prediction problem as a learning task specific to each pair of users with different reciprocal delays. Evaluations show that our time-aware framework eventually outperforms the conventional classifiers that ignore the temporal information.

10.23919/FRUCT52173.2021.9435451,Towards Automatic Modelling of Thematic Domains of a National Literature: Technical Issues in the Case of Russian,IEEE,Conferences,"A significant part of modern technologies associated with the development of artificial intelligence systems and digital analytics of diverse data relies on methods of computer text processing (NLP, speech technologies). However, NLP methods are applied primarily to specialized texts, such as scientific literature, technical documentation, news, etc., or social media discourse. Fiction texts are usually left out of the focus of NLP practitioners as the fictional world seems to be of less significance or less “information value” from a practical point of view. Moreover, due to the poetic and metaphorical nature of literary texts, the use of some NLP methods (e.g., topic modelling) for fiction analysis turned out to be more complicated. At the same time, the influence of literature both on the consciousness of individuals and on the formation of social values can hardly be overestimated. Besides, making computers “understand” fiction in a similar way as humans do would be a real challenge for artificial intelligence. The article puts forward the idea of modelling thematic areas of literature on a national scale, which should reveal the main thematic domains of national literature as a whole. It will allow a better understanding of the cultural traits of the national consciousness in a given historical period and contribute to either literary studies or practical tasks. Methodological approaches to determining and modelling themes of literary works are considered, technical difficulties arising in the process are described, and the ways to solve them are suggested. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the design of the corpus of Russian short stories of 1900-1930s and can be applied in the development of artificial intelligence systems that process large volumes of literary texts in any language.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9435451/,2021 29th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),12-14 May 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/RO-MAN50785.2021.9515348,Towards Out-of-Sight Predictive Tracking for Long-Term Indoor Navigation of Non-Holonomic Person Following Robot<sup>*</sup>,IEEE,Conferences,"The ability to predict the movements of the target person allows a person following robot (PFR) to coexist with the person while still complying with the social norms. In human-robot collaboration, this is an essential requisite for long-term time-dependent navigation and not losing sight of the person during momentary occlusions that may arise from a crowd due to static or dynamic obstacles, other human beings, or intersections in the local surrounding. The PFR must not only traverse to the previously unknown goal position but also relocate the target person after the miss, and resume following. In this paper, we try to solve this as a coupled motion-planning and control problem by formulating a model predictive control (MPC) controller with non-linear constraints for a wheeled differential-drive robot. And, using a human motion prediction strategy based on the recorded pose and trajectory information of both the moving target person and the PFR, add additional constraints to the same MPC, to recompute the optimal controls to the wheels. We make comparisons with RNNs like LSTM and Early Relocation for learning the best-predicted reference path.MPC is best suited for complex constrained problems because it allows the PFR to periodically update the tracking information, as well as to adapt to the moving person’s stride. We show the results using a simulated indoor environment and lay the foundation for its implementation on a real robot. Our proposed method offers a robust person following behaviour without the explicit need for policy learning or offline computation, allowing us to design a generalized framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9515348/,2021 30th IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN),8-12 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

Hence, there is a need to call for software engineering perspective for BDI agent. Inline with the works on Software Engineering for AI application development, this paper introduces an alternative method to model BDI agent through a software engineering perspective. The requirement model, design and implementation of BDI based on software engineering approach are covered in this paper.

10.1109/CCGrid.2015.74,Towards a Realistic Scheduler for Mixed Workloads with Workflows,IEEE,Conferences,"Many fields of modern science require huge amounts of computation, and workflows are a very popular tool in e-Science since they allow to organize many small, simple tasks to solve big problems. They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhDresearch is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types. We are in the process of simulating policies, and we will validate our results by means of an implementation and real-world experiments with the KOALA-Workflow processing system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7152549/,"2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",4-7 May 2015,ieeexplore

The Internet is becoming a major part of everyone's daily life. Data representing trustful and suspicious activities is continuously generated and stored everywhere at an unprecedented scale. This extremely large data, which is known as Big Data, may contain critical and helpful information that can be used in detecting, and in many cases, preventing illegal activities, crimes and more importantly terror attacks. Unfortunately, the limitations on the communication between administrative zones, the huge amount of data and the intrinsically unstructured nature of such data makes leveraging its usefulness impractical.

These physical objects, generally referred to as the smart objects, when deployed in real-world aggregates useful information from their surrounding environment. As-of-late, this notion of IoT has been extended to incorporate the social networking facets which have led to the promising paradigm of the `Social Internet of Things' (SIoT). In SIoT, the devices operate as an autonomous agent and provide an exchange of information and services discovery in an intelligent manner by establishing social relationships among them with respect to their owners. Trust plays an important role in establishing trustworthy relationships among the physical objects and reduces probable risks in the decision making process. In this paper, a trust computational model is proposed to extract individual trust features in a SIoT environment. Furthermore, a machine learning-based heuristic is used to aggregate all the trust features in order to ascertain an aggregate trust score.

Nevertheless, one can be data-rich and knowledge-poor, and this is where the data analytics and the development and application of machine learning models become necessity for gaining insight of complex processes to prove scientific theories and discoveries, support decision making and enhance strategic planning in different areas of the economy, finance, industry, healthcare, etc. Recently, there is an influx of polymorphic, unstructured and multimodal data - social media, images, audio, video, etc., which is complicating further the data processing and knowledge extraction process. But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that. Then will briefly talk about supervised and unsupervised learning and the use of three supervised approaches: Neural Networks (NN); Random Forests (RF); and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for solving radar signal classification and source identification problem. Results from applying the NN, RF and SVM (using R and Matlab) on complete data subset (without missing data) and the full dataset with substituted (up to 60%) missing data with MI, KNN-I and BTl will be critically analysed and discussed. Finally, I'll talk about the opportunities and challenges in applying computational intelligence and machine learning techniques to Big Data and the available software for Big Data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7407137/,2015 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI),20-22 Nov. 2015,ieeexplore

As of 2017, Twitter's outreach is over 317M monthly active users generating more than 320M tweets every day, thus making it one of the fastest information deployment mediums of this era. In order to aid data distribution without causing a glut of information to the users, we develop a recommender system focusing on a vital aspect of social media - relationships among users, addressing a popular problem of users - who to follow/befriend? By choosing the right accounts and users to follow, the sources of information can be controlled as desired. The information collected from the most recent tweets of a user is used to find other users whose recent tweets contain similar information, ensuring there is at least one mutual friend among users. By making use of the continuous and real time updating of data on social networks, we develop a method to ensure our training sets consist of relevant information for classification, thus preserving accuracy while reducing training set sizes for probabilistic learning models. We use two algorithms to detect tweets of common topics, namely a Noun Phrase detector and a Naïve Bayes Text (Topic) Classifier and further compare their complexity and accuracy. The Naive Bayes Classifier, despite being probabilistic, functioned well with a relatively small training set. This is only with the exception of Twitter as it is a real-time updating framework. Exact matches were hard to obtain with the Noun phrase detector, as we are going only one level deep due to limited compute. However, when matches were found, it is upto 90% accurate. Experiments on tweets of random public users have found that Naive Bayes Classifier with a small but recent training data set can work as well as or better than a Collaborative filter without the assumptions of the Collaborative model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8272631/,2017 International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science(ICCIDS),2-3 June 2017,ieeexplore

Beside that, a parallel implementation of feature extraction is deployed to make the system work real time. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted on four real-life datasets. The experimental results show that we can obtain the detection rate up to 100% on some datasets. We also get real time performance with a speed of image stream of about 40 images per second.

This information is not always explicitly available for online systems. To identify the interests, existing studies merely focused on modeling the relationships between user generated contents and user interests. However, the interests of a user should not only be inferred by user generated contents, but also the relationships between users which might imply the user interests. In this paper, our goal is to unveil the true interests of users based on user generated contents as well as relationships between users. We built a probabilistic user interests model and proposed a user interests propagation algorithm (UIP) to tackle this problem. A factor graph-based approach is utilized to estimate the distribution of the interests of users. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, we integrated our UIP algorithm with the classical matrix factorization algorithm to deal with the rating prediction task.

10.1109/ICTAI.2017.00035,Using Deep Learning for Community Discovery in Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Community detection is an important task in social network analysis. Existing methods typically use the topological information alone, and ignore the rich information available in the content data. Recently, some researchers have noticed that user profiles can also benefit to community detection, and hence the combination of topology and node contents has become a new hot topic. Some methods using both topology and content have been proposed. However, they often suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they cannot extract a potential deep representation of the network; 2) they cannot automatically weight different information sources with adequate balance parameters. To overcome these issues, we propose a deep integration representation (DIR) algorithm via deep joint reconstruction, which is motivated by the similarity between deep feedforward auto-encoders and spectral clustering in terms of matrix reconstruction. Thanks to spectral clustering which is one of the best community detection methods, the proposed new method is also good at community discovery task. In addition, DIR has further benefit because it not only provides a nonlinear and deep representation of the network, but also learns the most suitable balance between different components automatically. We compare the proposed new approach with nine state-of-the-art community detection methods on eight real relatively large networks.

10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.52,Using Physical Stigmergy in Decentralized Optimization under Multiple Non-separable Constraints: Formal Methods and an Intelligent Lighting Example,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper, a distributed asynchronous algorithm for intelligent lighting is presented that minimizes collective power use while meeting multiple user lighting constraints simultaneously and requires very little communication among agents participating in the distributed computation. Consequently, the approach is arbitrarily scalable, adapts to exogenous disturbances, and is robust to failures of individual agents. This algorithm is an example of a decentralized primal-space algorithm for constrained non-linear optimization that achieves coordination between agents using stigmergic memory cues present in the physical system as opposed to explicit communication and synchronization. Not only does this work make of stigmergy, a property first used to describe decentralized decision making in eusocial insects, but details of the algorithm are inspired by classic social foraging theory and more recent results in eusocial-insect macronutrient regulation. This theoretical analysis in this paper guarantees that the decentralized stigmergically coupled system converges to within a finite neighborhood of the optimal resource allocation. These results are validated using a hardware implementation of the algorithm in a small-scale intelligent lighting scenario. There are other real-time distributed resource allocation applications that are amenable to these methods, like distributed power generation, in general, this paper means to provide proof of concept that physical variables in cyberphysical systems can be leveraged to reduce the communication burden of algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6969416/,2014 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops,19-23 May 2014,ieeexplore

Most existing hashing methods for social image retrieval are batch-based which may violate the nature of social images, i.e., social images are usually generated periodically or collected in a stream fashion. Although there exist many online hashing methods, they either adopt unsupervised learning which ignore the relevant tags, or are designed in the supervised manner which needs high-quality labels.

This experimentation contains 3 parts: a) data acquisitions and a learning step; b) classification; c) Kinematic analysis of the evolution of subjects to interact with the avatar. To successfully drive our study, all the using scripts are writing under Matlab and C/C++. Then the using equipments are: 1) Qualisys motion capture camera (qualisys system). The qualisys system is delivered with a desk computer with 8 GB, a processor Intel core i7-4770k (8 CPUs) at 3.5 GHz. The frequency of those cameras can varies from 100 to 500 Hz. A black glove equipped with infrared reflective markers, all those equipments are also provided by qualisys system. 2) A Matlab software (version R2014a) installed on a desk computer (qualisys system); the Qualisys system provide a specific driver that allow to couple all the Matlab scripts with their system. Thus, it is possible to command all the cameras directly from Matlab for real time analysis, see Fig. 1 .",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8756520/,2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2019),14-18 May 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICED.2016.7804679,Wide scope and fast websites phishing detection using URLs lexical features,IEEE,Conferences,"Phishing is a considerable problem differs from the other security threats such as intrusions and Malware which are based on the technical security holes of the network systems. The weakness point of any network system is its Users. Phishing attacks are targeting these users depending on the trikes of social engineering. Despite there are several ways to carry out these attacks, unfortunately the current phishing detection techniques cover some attack vectors like email and fake websites. Therefore, building a specific limited scope detection system will not provide complete protection from the wide phishing attack vectors. This paper develops detection system with a wide protection scope using URL features only which is relying on the fact that users directly deal with URLs to surf the internet and provides a good approach to detect malicious URLs as proved by previous studies. Additionally, Anti-phishing solutions can be positioned at different levels of attack flow where most researchers are focusing on client side solutions which turn to add more processing overhead at the client side and lead to losing the trust and satisfaction of the users. Nowadays many organizations make centralized protection of spam filtering. This paper proposes a system which can be integrated into such process in order to increase the detection performance in a real time. The simulation results of the proposed system showed a phishing URLs detection accuracy with 93% and provided online process of a single URL in average time of 0.12 second.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7804679/,2016 3rd International Conference on Electronic Design (ICED),11-12 Aug. 2016,ieeexplore

Events are regarded as happening in a certain place, during a particular interval of time which can be occurred planned or unplanned way. Social media is a platform where users share their attending events with others. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning based approach to identify events from social media, i.e., Twitter, by using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based word embedding technique. Events might be connected with each other which might have real life implications such as identifying causal-effect, investigating criminal activities, etc. We also demonstrate a mechanism which can organize relevant events into a cluster based on their spatiotemporal properties. Later, we develop an unsupervised connected event labeling technique by using BERT word embedding approach by exploiting its semantic strength from the content of tweets. Our model shows an outstanding performance which has an accuracy of 91%. We also compare our approach with two competitive baseline techniques (i.e., word2vec and tf-idf) to identify events and our model shows better performance (on an average 5% better accuracy) than that of those baseline models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9537046/,2021 International Conference on Software Engineering & Computer Systems and 4th International Conference on Computational Science and Information Management (ICSECS-ICOCSIM),24-26 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/CloudCom.2011.21,iHadoop: Asynchronous Iterations for MapReduce,IEEE,Conferences,"MapReduce is a distributed programming framework designed to ease the development of scalable data-intensive applications for large clusters of commodity machines. Most machine learning and data mining applications involve iterative computations over large datasets, such as the Web hyperlink structures and social network graphs. Yet, the MapReduce model does not efficiently support this important class of applications. The architecture of MapReduce, most critically its dataflow techniques and task scheduling, is completely unaware of the nature of iterative applications, tasks are scheduled according to a policy that optimizes the execution for a single iteration which wastes bandwidth, I/O, and CPU cycles when compared with an optimal execution for a consecutive set of iterations. This work presents iHadoop, a modified MapReduce model, and an associated implementation, optimized for iterative computations. The iHadoop model schedules iterations asynchronously. It connects the output of one iteration to the next, allowing both to process their data concurrently. iHadoop's task scheduler exploits inter-iteration data locality by scheduling tasks that exhibit a producer/consumer relation on the same physical machine allowing a fast local data transfer. For those iterative applications that require satisfying certain criteria before termination, iHadoop runs the check concurrently during the execution of the subsequent iteration to further reduce the application's latency. This paper also describes our implementation of the iHadoop model, and evaluates its performance against Hadoop, the widely used open source implementation of MapReduce. Experiments using different data analysis applications over real-world and synthetic datasets show that iHadoop performs better than Hadoop for iterative algorithms, reducing execution time of iterative applications by 25% on average. Furthermore, integrating iHadoop with HaLoop, a variant Hadoop implementation that caches invariant data between iterations, reduces execution time by 38% on average.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133130/,2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011,ieeexplore
10.1109/TAMD.2011.2112766,A Biologically Inspired Architecture for an Autonomous and Social Robot,IEEE,Journals,"Lately, lots of effort has been put into the construction of robots able to live among humans. This fact has favored the development of personal or social robots, which are expected to behave in a natural way. This implies that these robots could meet certain requirements, for example, to be able to decide their own actions (autonomy), to be able to make deliberative plans (reasoning), or to be able to have an emotional behavior in order to facilitate human-robot interaction. In this paper, the authors present a bioinspired control architecture for an autonomous and social robot, which tries to accomplish some of these features. In order to develop this new architecture, authors have used as a base a prior hybrid control architecture (AD) that is also biologically inspired. Nevertheless, in the later, the task to be accomplished at each moment is determined by a fix sequence processed by the Main Sequencer. Therefore, the main sequencer of the architecture coordinates the previously programmed sequence of skills that must be executed. In the new architecture, the main sequencer is substituted by a decision making system based on drives, motivations, emotions, and self-learning, which decides the proper action at every moment according to robot's state. Consequently, the robot improves its autonomy since the added decision making system will determine the goal and consequently the skills to be executed. A basic version of this new architecture has been implemented on a real robotic platform.

The system encapsulates the parallel distributed processing of real-world stimuli through different sensor modalities and encoding them into features vectors which in turn are processed via a number of dedicated processing units (DPUs) through hierarchical paths. DPUs are algorithmic realizations of the cell assemblies in neuroscience. A plausible and realistic perceptual system is presented via the integration of the outputs from these units by spiking neural networks.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007141,A Collaborative Method for Protecting Teens Against Online Predators Over Social Networks: A Behavioral Analysis,IEEE,Journals,"Online social networks have gained ubiquitous popularity in the last decade but despite the advantages, they have also raised privacy concerns for users. Many people have lost their jobs, relationships, and are stalked because of online privacy breaches. This situation is even more disturbing for young teens as they are in the process of learning emotional, social, and physical behaviors. Online predators take advantage of their immaturity and raise various threats to teens including aggression, rape, abduction, physical and emotional sadistic torture, and even human trafficking. Teens, on the other hand, do not have any mechanism to protect them against such threats. Therefore, this research addresses this overlooked need and proposes a trust model for the teen community, which can evaluate the trustworthiness of a stranger based on teens' psychological and social needs. This paper first identifies various factors of teen psychology from literature, and then proposes a trust model for teens based on those factors. The model ensures the trustworthiness of a stranger through a two-dimension matrix consists of his reputation in other teens and reliability. The proposed model was simulated through colored Petri nets and implemented as a real-time trust evaluation application over Facebook.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975877,A Content-Based Method for Sybil Detection in Online Social Networks via Deep Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Online social networks (OSNs) are generally susceptible to Sybil attack, which causes a series of cybersecurity problems and privacy violations. Malicious attackers can create massive Sybils and further utilize those fake identities to launch various Sybil attacks. Therefore, Sybil detection in OSNs has become an urgent security research problem for both academia and industries. The existing content-based methods to detect Sybils base on the combination of manual-design features and machine learning algorithms, which requires lots of professional experiences and human effort. These methods divide the Sybil detection problem into two piece-wise sub-problems, which prevents us from getting the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel content-based method to detect Sybils. The proposed method is an end-to-end classification model that extracts features directly from the input data, and then output the classification results in a unified framework. The proposed method includes three main parts: first, the self-normalizing convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to extract lower features from the multi-dimensional input data; second, the bidirectional self-normalizing LSTM network (bi-SN-LSTM) is developed to extract higher features from the compressed feature map sequence; third, the dense layer and softmax classifier are stacked to output the classification results. Unlike the traditional bidirectional long short-term memory network (bi-LSTM), the proposed bi-SN-LSTM network utilizes SELU as the activation function of its recurrent step, which provides unbounded changes to the state value. Through the case study of the real-world dataset, the comparison experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007376/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TII.2020.2995766,A Directed Edge Weight Prediction Model Using Decision Tree Ensembles in Industrial Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"As the application of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) becomes more widespread, the IIoT is being combined with social networks. Nodes in the network can be users, machines, and so on. Using the sensing detection technology of the IIoT, industrial machines can realize real-time informatization, which is convenient for users to perform remote management. Nodes can communicate with each other and make ratings. These ratings can be modeled as directed weighted edges between nodes and form directed weighted networks (DWNs). The edge weight represents the “strength” of relationship and the direction of edge points from the edge generator to the edge receiver. Predicting edge weights in DWNs is critical to predicting unknown ratings or recovering lost data. In this article, we propose a directed edge weight prediction model (DEWP) using decision tree ensembles. It extends the local similarity indices to DWNs and extracts a series of similarity indices between nodes as features of each edge. These features are used to construct a blended regression model of random forest, gradient boost decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient boosting machine. The proposed algorithm was evaluated experimentally with the Bitcoin OTC and Bitcoin Alpha datasets by removing 10% to 90% of edges in the original network.

10.1109/TCSS.2018.2861775,A Hybrid Privacy Protection Scheme in Cyber-Physical Social Networks,IEEE,Journals,"The rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices has significantly enhanced the popularization of the cyber-physical social network, where users actively publish data with sensitive information. Adversaries can easily obtain these data and launch continuous attacks to breach privacy. However, existing works only focus on either location privacy or identity privacy with a static adversary. This results in privacy leakage and possible further damage. Motivated by this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving scheme, which considers both location and identity privacy against a dynamic adversary. We study the privacy protection problem as the tradeoff between the users aiming at maximizing data utility with high-level privacy protection while adversaries possessing the opposite goal. We first establish a game-based Markov decision process model, in which the user and the adversary are regarded as two players in a dynamic multistage zero-sum game. To acquire the best strategy for users, we employ a modified state-action-reward-state-action reinforcement learning algorithm. Iteration times decrease because of cardinality reduction from n to 2, which accelerates the convergence process. Our extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the propose method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8444976/,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/TWC.2020.3033822,A Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Game-Based Analysis for Incentive Mechanisms in Socially-Aware Mobile Crowdsensing,IEEE,Journals,"The mobile crowdsensing paradigm facilitates a broad range of emerging sensing applications by leveraging ubiquitous mobile users to cooperatively perform certain sensing tasks with their smart devices. As this paradigm involves data collection from users, the issue of designing rewards to incentivize users is fundamentally important to ensure participation in crowdsensing. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in healthcare-based crowdsensing services, the fun of tracking daily nutrition information for a certain user can be promoted by comparing her nutritional information with that contributed and shared by her socially-connected friends. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive mechanisms in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users. Understanding the behaviors of users and service providers in socially-aware crowdsensing is of paramount importance for incentive mechanisms. With this focus, we propose a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game approach to model the strategic interactions among service providers and users, where the social influence of users and the strategic interconnections of service providers are jointly and formally integrated into the game modeling. Through backward induction methods, we theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. We conduct extensive simulations to investigate game equilibrium properties, and the real-world dataset is applied to evaluate and demonstrate the performance effectiveness of the proposed game model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9247464/,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,March 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957779,A Multidimensional Trust Evaluation Framework for Online Social Networks Based on Machine Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Due to the openness of online social networks (OSNs), they have become the most popular platforms for people to communicate with others in the expectation of sharing their opinions in a trustworthy environment. However, individuals are often exposed to a wide range of risks posed by malicious users who spread various fake information to achieve their vicious goals, which makes the concept of trust a vital issue. Most of the existing research attempts to construct a trust network among users, whereas only a few studies pay attention to analyzing their features. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation framework based on machine learning to facilitate human decision making by extensively considering multiple trust-related user features and criteria. We first divide user features into four groups according to the empirical analysis, including profile-based features, behavior-based features, feedback-based features, and link-based features. Then, we design a lightweight feature selection approach to evaluate the effectiveness of every single feature and find out the optimal combination of features from users' online records. We formalize trust analysis as a classification problem to simplify the verification process.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124386,A Multiple Pheromone Communication System for Swarm Intelligence,IEEE,Journals,"Pheromones are chemical substances essential for communication among social insects. In the application of swarm intelligence to real micro mobile robots, the deployment of a single virtual pheromone has emerged recently as a powerful real-time method for indirect communication. However, these studies usually exploit only one kind of pheromones in their task, neglecting the crucial fact that in the world of real insects, multiple pheromones play important roles in shaping stigmergic behaviors such as foraging or nest building. To explore the multiple pheromones mechanism which enable robots to solve complex collective tasks efficiently, we introduce an artificial multiple pheromone system (ColCOS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Phi $ </tex-math></inline-formula>) to support swarm intelligence research by enabling multiple robots to deploy and react to multiple pheromones simultaneously. The proposed system ColCOS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Phi $ </tex-math></inline-formula> uses optical signals to emulate different evaporating chemical substances i.e. pheromones. These emulated pheromones are represented by trails displayed on a wide LCD display screen positioned horizontally, on which multiple miniature robots can move freely. The color sensors beneath the robots can detect and identify lingering “pheromones” on the screen. Meanwhile, the release of any pheromone from each robot is enabled by monitoring its positional information over time with an overhead camera. No other communication methods apart from virtual pheromones are employed in this system. Two case studies have been carried out which have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving complex swarm tasks as empowered by multiple pheromones. This novel platform is a timely and powerful tool for research into swarm intelligence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9594791/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056079,A Novel Stacking Approach for Accurate Detection of Fake News,IEEE,Journals,"With the increasing popularity of social media, people has changed the way they access news. News online has become the major source of information for people. However, much information appearing on the Internet is dubious and even intended to mislead. Some fake news are so similar to the real ones that it is difficult for human to identify them. Therefore, automated fake news detection tools like machine learning and deep learning models have become an essential requirement. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five machine learning models and three deep learning models on two fake and real news datasets of different size with hold out cross validation. We also used term frequency, term frequency-inverse document frequency and embedding techniques to obtain text representation for machine learning and deep learning models respectively. To evaluate models' performance, we used accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as the evaluation metrics and a corrected version of McNemar's test to determine if models' performance is significantly different. Then, we proposed our novel stacking model which achieved testing accuracy of 99.94% and 96.05 % respectively on the ISOT dataset and KDnugget dataset. Furthermore, the performance of our proposed method is high as compared to baseline methods.

Since the number and size of the networks modeled by graphs grow larger and larger, some level of parallelism needs to be used, to reduce the computational costs of such massive applications. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (referred to as lists on Facebook and Twitter), while users, based on their interests, place themselves into groups of interest. However, the community detection and is a very effortful procedure, and in addition, these communities need to be updated very often, resulting in more effort. In this paper, we combine parallel processing techniques with a typical data structure like threaded binary trees to detect communities in an efficient manner. Our strategy is implemented over weighted networks with irregular topologies and it is based on a stepwise path detection strategy, where each step finds a link that increases the overall strength of the path being detected.

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification.

For example, in the field of open-source software development, most software developments require multiple developers to collaborate with each other. With the increase in the number and variety of social-collaboration tasks, it is difficult for individuals to discover social-collaboration tasks that they can participate. If we can help match the social-collaboration tasks with appropriate users, the quality and speed of these tasks will be improved, thus social organizations (e.g., companies, teams, and research institutions) and individuals can improve productivity, which is very significant. However, most related work in recommending individuals to participate in social-collaboration tasks mainly focus on individual's data features/characteristics (e.g., personal behaviors and attributes), and little work is based on the social collaborative data features/characteristics within the individual's participation in the social-collaboration tasks, such as the types of social-collaboration tasks that individuals participate, collaborative content, collaborative behavior, collaborative intensity, and so on. This paper proposes a universal recommendation method based on personal social-collaboration preferences, which is used to recommend the social-collaboration tasks that individuals can participate. The characteristics of social-collaboration data contain a large number of individuals' preferences for social-collaboration, which helps improve recommendation performance. We perform a large number of experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, based on our collected real-world data sets in the open source software development services (Bugzilla and Github).

In this paper, we propose an attention-based network embedding model that exploits the social structures for user alignment. In particular, two main components are contained in our model framework: a masked graph attention mechanism which tries to learn the alignment task driven attention weights by the supervision of pre-aligned user pairs, and an embedding algorithm tries to learn a common vector space by explicitly modeling the weighted contribution probabilities between follower-ships and followee-ships. With the learned weights and embeddings transferring between these two components, we construct a unified model for user embedding and alignment.

While a growing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POI recommendation, they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographical regions, i.e., users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions, which discounts the recommendation quality of existing methods, especially for out-of-town users. In this paper, we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-Temporal LDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents of their checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-town regions are extremely sparse, ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by considering the public's visiting behaviors at the target region. To further alleviate the issue of data sparsity, a social-spatial collective inference framework is built on ST-LDA to enhance the inference of region-dependent personal interests by effectively exploiting the social and spatial correlation information. Besides, based on ST-LDA, we design an effective attribute pruning (AP) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality and support fast online recommendation for large-scale POI data. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our ST-LDA model on two real-world and large-scale datasets.

We propose a novel deep learning-based method for this problem and design an attention-based neural network with semantic-based regularization, which can mimic users' reading and annotation behavior to formulate better document representation, leveraging the semantic relations among labels. The network separately models the title and the content of each document and injects an explicit, title-guided attention mechanism into each sentence. To exploit the correlation among labels, we propose two semantic-based loss regularizers, i.e., similarity and subsumption, which enforce the output of the network to conform to label semantics. The model with the semantic-based loss regularizers is referred to as the joint multilabel attention network (JMAN).

Ransomware is a kind of malware that is the main threat to digital extortion and has caused many organizations to lose huge revenue by paying much bigger ransom demands to the cybercriminals in recent years. The explosive growth of ransomware is due to the existing large infection vector such as social engineering, email attachment, zip file download, browsing malicious site, infected search engine which are boosted dramatically by easily available cryptographic tools, Ransomware As a Service (RaaS), increased cloud storage and off-the-self ransomware toolkits. The large infection vector and available toolkits not only grew ransomware extremely, but also made them more obfuscated, encrypted and varying patterns in the new variants. This, in turn, caused the conventional supervised analysis and detection engine to fail to detect the new variants of ransomware. This paper addresses the limitations of conventional supervised detection engine and proposes semi-supervised framework to compute the inherent latent sources of the varying patterns in the new variants in an unsupervised way using deep learning approaches. The proposed framework extracts the inherent characteristics in the varying patterns from the unlabelled ransomware obtained from the wild which is scalable to accommodate upcoming malicious executables. Then the unsupervised learned model is combined with supervised classification, thus constructing an adaptive detection model.

It expresses more beyond plaintexts and makes the content more vivid. Using appropriate emojis in messages and microblog posts makes you lovely and friendly. Recently, emoji recommendation becomes a significant task since it is hard to choose the appropriate one from thousands of emoji candidates. In this paper, we propose a Context-Aware Personalized Emoji Recommendation (CAPER) model fusing the contextual information and the personal information. It is to learn latent factors of contextual and personal information through a score-ranking matrix factorization framework. The personal factors such as user preference, user gender, and the current time can make the recommended emojis meet users' individual needs. Moreover, we consider the co-occurrence factors of the emojis which could improve the recommendation accuracy. We conduct a series of experiments on the real-world datasets, and experiment results show better performance of our model than existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the considering contextual and personal factors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8960434/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This operation is common in many real-life applications such as GIS, data mining and recommender systems. However, the k-CP problem has not been well studied in Dynamic Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (D-CPSS), where temporal information and multiple attributes are associated with each edge. In D-CPSS, people would like to specify multiple constraints on these attributes within a time interval to illustrate their requirements.

10.1109/TCSS.2021.3052231,Cognitive Analytics of Social Media Services for Edge Resource Pre-Allocation in Industrial Manufacturing,IEEE,Journals,"With the development of industrial intelligence, the resource requests of various social media services in smart cities are expanding rapidly. For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests. Then based on the analysis results, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) scheme is designed with multiobjective optimization.

10.1109/JIOT.2020.3018304,Collaborative Social Internet of Things in Mobile Edge Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Artificial intelligence (AI) on chips has recently driven the expansion of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), where a group of SIoT devices with social relations can collaboratively identify and handle local events without the help of remote servers. On the other hand, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a favorable way to locally process SIoT data for reducing data transmission and computation among SIoT devices and backhaul networks. Nevertheless, the load sharing among SIoT devices, MEC, and remote servers brings about new challenges for the communication and computation tradeoff, cross-layer design in SIoT, and forwarding and aggregation tradeoff. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, SIoT collaborative group and device selection problem (SCGDSP), and prove the NP-hardness. We first explore the intrinsic properties of a fundamental SCGDSP case by finding the optimal collaborative group for each user request. Then, we design an approximation algorithm for the general SCGDSP that first evaluates candidate collaborative groups under different social relations, and then selects the collaborative groups and SIoT devices properly. For scalability, the proposed algorithm also supports dynamic user requests and can be distributionally deployed in massive networks enabling collaborative MEC. Moreover, it also sustains local SIoT services, where the computation only involves SIoT devices and MEC servers. Simulation results demonstrate that effective SIoT and collaborative group selection (ESCGS) can reduce by more than 50% of the total communication and computation costs compared with baseline schemes in the real networks from topology zoo. Moreover, the distributed ESCGS reduces by 87% of the running time with total 16.5-MB message overhead, requiring no more than 0.05-ms transmission delay in a 100-Gb/s backbone network with eight MEC servers, 1000 SIoTs, and 800 monitored locations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9171854/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Existing approaches focus mainly on arrangement strategies that include users and events on an EBSN platform under an offline scenario, where all information is known in advance. However, these strategies ignore the importance of the organizer, and the offline scenarios can be impractical since all elements appear dynamically in reality. Therefore, we consider not only the user and event in the EBSN platform under the online scenario but also the importance of the organizer. In this paper, we study the complex dynamic event participant in an EBSN that considers three elements: users, events and organizers. We first formalize the event arrangement problem in the online scenario through event arrangement through three-dimensional matching (EATDM). Then, we propose a straightforward solution of the EATDM problem, a greedy algorithm with a competitive ratio, and further develop a basis solution, a random algorithm. We also propose a threshold-based algorithm and a weighted-threshold algorithm with a tighter competitive ratio. Finally, we verify the validity and practicability of the proposed algorithms on synthetic and real datasets, and we find that the weighted-threshold algorithm performs better than the random algorithm, the greedy algorithm and the threshold-based algorithm in terms of the total utility value.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8859303/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Spam detection methods can be broadly divided into expert-based and machine learning-based detection methods. When experts participate in spam detection, the detection accuracy is fairly high. However, this method is highly time-consuming and expensive. Conversely, methods using machine learning have the advantage of automation, but their accuracy is relatively low. This paper proposes a spam-detection framework that combines and fully exploits the advantages of both methods. To reduce the workload of the experts, all messages are first analyzed via a primary machine learning filter, and those that are determined to be normal messages are allowed through, whereas suspicious messages are flagged. The flagged messages are subsequently analyzed by an expert to enhance the overall system accuracy. In the filtering process, cost-based machine learning is used to prevent the fatal error of misidentifying a spam message as a normal message. In addition, to obviate the continuously evolving spam trends, a module that periodically updates the expert-diagnosis results on the training dataset is incorporated into the framework. The results of experiments conducted, on an imbalanced dataset of spam tweets and normal tweets in a ratio similar to the actual situation in real life, indicate that the proposed framework has a spam-detection rate of almost 92.8%, which is higher than that of the conventional machine learning technique. Furthermore, the proposed framework delivered stable high performance even in an environment where social network messages changed continuously, unlike the conventional technique, which exhibited large performance deviations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9492082/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, we study the problem from a completely new perspective by modeling users' historical job records as a dynamic bipartite graph. Specifically, we propose a bipartite graph embedding method with temporal information called dynamic bipartite graph embedding (DBGE) to learn the vector representation of employees and companies. Our approach not only considers the relations between employees and companies but also incorporates temporal information embedded in consecutive work records. We first define the Horary Random Walk on a bipartite graph to generate a sequence for each vertex in chronological order. Then, we employ the skip-gram model to obtain a temporal low-dimensional vector representation for each vertex and apply machine learning methods to predict employee turnover behavior by combining embedded features with employees' basic information. Experiments on a real-world dataset collected from one of China's largest online professional social networks show that the features learned through DBGE can significantly improve turnover prediction performance.

The providers of OSNs typically leverage demographic attributes of users in OSNs to perform business behaviors like personalized commodity recommendation, advertisement delivery, etc. Thus, understanding demographic attributes of users in OSNs is of great importance. However, some users refuse to reveal their demographic information due to privacy concerns. Therefore, inferring demographic attributes of users in OSNs with public information is an attractive topic for researchers. Most existing methods mainly focus on individual attribute inference without taking the relationship among attributes into account, which results in low precisions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called DeepAttr, to infer users' multiple attributes simultaneously. DeepAttr leverages existing network embedding algorithm to learn the social embedding for each user. Meanwhile, it encodes multiple attributes into structured attribute vectors which are treated as class labels. The core component of DeepAttr is a multi-layer fully connected deep neural network which captures complex nonlinear mapping between the users' social embeddings and the structured attribute vectors. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DeepAttr outperforms existing models in both single-attribute inference and multiple-attribute inference as to macro-Precision, macro-Recall, and macro-F1.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835029/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Second, by exploring hierarchies over the extracted factors and displaying these factors in an interactive, hierarchical visualization interface, we shed light on how to effectively communicate the interpreted model to end users. Specially, the interpretation separates the predictables from the unpredictables for stock prediction through the use of intercept model parameters and a risk visualization design. Third, we evaluate the integrated visualization system through two case studies in predicting the stock price with financial news and company-related tweets from social media. Quantitative experiments comparing the proposed neural network architecture with state-of-the-art models and the human baseline are conducted and reported.

Conversational data from social media contain a considerable amount of useful information, and such data are the foundation for researching dynamic and artificial emotion. At present, most human–machine interaction systems focus on the complexity and accuracy of the dialog but neglect the emotional characteristics of the speaker. When generating a dialog considering the emotional personality of the interlocutor, controlling, and guiding the dialog to a specified direction are essential. This article presents a system for studying dynamic emotions in human-computer interaction from the perspective of emotional transfer and guidance. Based on the emotional state of the interlocutor and the distribution of emotional transfer, the process of emotional transfer is simulated and sampled, and the sequence of emotional guidance is generated. In this system, two algorithms are proposed. A generative Markov chain Monte Carlo (GEN-MCMC) algorithm is proposed to generate a variety of emotional transfer sequences that fit the talke’s personality dynamically based on the real-world dialog. Further, a guiding MCMC (GUI-MCMC) algorithm-based GEN-MCMC is proposed to generate the emotional guiding sequences. The generated emotional sequences by GEN-MCMC were evaluated in two aspects: 1) consistency and 2) diversity. The experimental results show that the GEN-MCMC algorithm performs better than the general sequence generation algorithm in terms of consistency and diversity in generating emotional states. The GUI-MCMC was able to generate a proper stimulus sequence when given the first and target emotions. An emotional stimulus sequence can simulate the emotional transfer of the interlocutor in the process of dialogue, and give the observer appropriate reference to guide and control the emotions of dialogue. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively model the dynamic emotion in emotional transfer and guidance, which can be further used to build chat robots, intelligent assistants, and human–machine interaction systems.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information.

The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy.

In addition, most of the designed mechanisms do not provide any guarantees that the Nash equilibrium (NE) will be reached asymptotically. Whenever such results are provided, they refer to convergence of specific predesigned learning dynamics and it is assumed that agents will follow such prescription. Both assumptions are an impediment in practical application of mechanism design in real-life allocation problems. In this article, we consider two common resource allocation problems: sharing K infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an infinitely divisible public good with P features, that is shared between strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set of agents who communicate through a given network. In a distributed mechanism, agents' messages are not broadcasted to all other agents as in the standard mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE, they fully implement the social welfare maximizing allocation, and are budget-balanced at NE. Subsequently, it is shown that the mechanisms induce a game with contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning dynamics within the adaptive best-response dynamics class, including dynamics such as Cournot best-response, k-period best-response, and Fictitious Play. While the abovementioned mechanisms have message dimensionality that grows quadratically with the number of agents, we show that if one is willing to forgo the strong convergence guarantees, it is possible to design a distributed mechanism with total message space dimensionality growing only linearly with the number of agents.

In this paper, we identify the problem of dynamic topical community detection and propose a dynamic topical community detection (DTCD) method to detect communities and their topical meanings in dynamic networks. The DTCD is a generative model integrating network structure, text, and time. The DTCD considers a community as a mixture of topics and generates the neighbors and documents of the node and their time stamps at the same time via the community. The latent variables are learned by collapsed Gibbs sampling. The DTCD not only can find communities and their topics, but also capture the temporal variations of communities and topics. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DTCD.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8733810/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage, limiting the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential of social influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade ago, researchers started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The challenge is to find the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to maximise the influence spread in networks. In typical approach we will activate all seeds in single stage, at the beginning of the process, while in this work we introduce and evaluate a new approach for seeds activation in temporal networks based on sequential seeding. Instead of activating all nodes at the same time, this method distributes the activations of seeds, leading to higher ranges of influence spread. The results of experiments performed using real and randomised networks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms single stage seeding in 71% of cases by nearly 6% on average. Knowing that temporal networks are an adequate choice for modelling dynamic processes, the results of this work can be interpreted as encouraging to apply temporal sequential seeding for real world cases, especially knowing that more sophisticated seed selection strategies can be implemented by using the seed activation strategy introduced in this work.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169627/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Their application in fire detection systems will substantially improve detection accuracy, which will eventually minimize fire disasters and reduce the ecological and social ramifications. However, the major concern with CNN-based fire detection systems is their implementation in real-world surveillance networks, due to their high memory and computational requirements for inference. In this paper, we propose an original, energy-friendly, and computationally efficient CNN architecture, inspired by the SqueezeNet architecture for fire detection, localization, and semantic understanding of the scene of the fire. It uses smaller convolutional kernels and contains no dense, fully connected layers, which helps keep the computational requirements to a minimum. Despite its low computational needs, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution achieves accuracies that are comparable to other, more complex models, mainly due to its increased depth.

Altruistic tendencies, intended to benefit others with no apparent rewards, are also very useful for social robots that are designed to be used in our households. Yet, to make robots capable of learning how to help others as infants do, it is important to understand the mechanisms and motives responsible for the development of altruistic behavior. Further, understanding the mechanisms behind the early development of pro-social behavior would be a great contribution to the field of developmental psychology. To these ends, we hypothesize that infants from 14 months of age help others to minimize the differences between predicted actions and observations, that is, to minimize prediction errors. To evaluate our hypothesis, we created a computational model based on psychological studies and implemented it in real and simulated robots. Our system first acquires its own sensory-motor representation by interacting with its environment. Then, using its experience, the system recognizes and predicts others' actions and uses this prediction to estimate a prediction error.

Specifically, open-source software (OSS) development requires developers to collaborate with each other to conduct their work. Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the OSS projects (e.g., bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, and so on) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on OSS projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: social network analysis, DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting overtime. DSNs over time are considered a small-world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55% diversity with 75% of evenness between the developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972481/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,July 2020,ieeexplore

They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship. More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks. However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation. Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation). In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification. We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network. As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training. Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC. Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329517/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

Personalized POI recommendation is a significant task in location-based social networks(LBSNs) because it helps target users explore their surrounding environment and greatly benefits the business in real life. Although a personalized POI recommendation system can significantly facilitate users' outdoor activities, it faces many challenging problems, such as the hardness to model human mobility and the difficulty to address data sparsity. Moreover, geographical influence on users should be personalized, but current studies only model the geographical influence on all users' check-in behaviors in a universal way.

Secondly, our system takes into account three features of the human mobility pattern: spatial, temporal, and sequential properties.

Unfortunately, the hidden information is likely to be predicted by various powerful inference attacks with the rapid advances in machine learning. Then, what is the risk that a user's private information could be disclosed? What countermeasures can be taken to fight against the privacy violation for the user? To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk.

Fake news detection has become an increasingly challenging task. Although many current works focus on constructing models extracting abstract features from the content of each post, they neglect the intrinsic semantic architecture such as latent topics, etc. These models only learn patterns in content coupled with certain specific latent topics on the training set to distinguish real and fake posts, which will suffer generalization and discriminating ability decline, especially when posts are associated with rare or new topics. Moreover, most existing works using deep schemes to extract and integrate textual and visual representation in post have not effectively modeled and sufficiently utilized the complementary and noisy multi-modal information containing semantic concepts and entities to complement and enhance each modal. In this paper, to deal with the above problems, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-modal Topic Memory Network (MTMN), which obtains and combines post representations shared across latent topics together with global features of latent topics while modeling intra-modality and inter-modality information in a unified framework. (1) To tackle real scenarios where newly arriving posts with different topic distribution from the training data, our method incorporates a topic memory module to explicitly characterize final representation as post feature shared across topics and global features of latent topics. These two kinds of features are jointly learned and then combined to generate robust representation.

Video data is a rich source of information and considered the most demanding in terms of storage space. With the huge development of digital video production, video management becomes a challenging task. Video content analysis (VCA) aims to provide big data solutions by automating the video management. To this end, shot boundary detection (SBD) is considered an essential step in VCA. It aims to partition the video sequence into shots by detecting shot transitions. High computational cost in transition detection is considered a bottleneck for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, a balance between detection accuracy and speed for SBD is addressed by presenting a new method for fast video processing. The proposed SBD framework is based on the concept of candidate segment selection with frame active area and separable moments. First, for each frame, the active area is selected such that only the informative content is considered. This leads to a reduction in the computational cost and disturbance factors. Second, for each active area, the moments are computed using orthogonal polynomials. Then, an adaptive threshold and inequality criteria are used to eliminate most of the non-transition frames and preserve candidate segments. For further elimination, two rounds of bisection comparisons are applied. As a result, the computational cost is reduced in the subsequent stages. Finally, machine learning statistics based on the support vector machine is implemented to detect the cut transitions. The enhancement of the proposed fast video processing method over existing methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy is verified. The average improvements in terms of frame percentage and transition accuracy percentage are 1.63% and 2.05%, respectively. Moreover, for the proposed SBD algorithm, a comparative study is performed with state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparison results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm in computation time with improvement of over 38%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9496657/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Consequently, the study of personalized project recommendation for developers has important theoretical and practical significance. However, existing recommendation approaches have clear limitations, such as ignoring developers' operating behavior, social relationships and practical skills, and are very inefficient for large amounts of data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes FunkR-pDAE (Funk singular value decomposition Recommendation using pearson correlation coefficient and Deep Auto-Encoders), a novel personalized project recommendation approach using a deep learning model. FunkR-pDAE first extracts data related to developers and open source projects from open source communities, which build a developer-open source project relevance matrix and a developer-developer relevance matrix. Meanwhile, Pearson Correlation Coefficient is utilized to calculate developer similarity using the developer-developer relevance matrix. Second, deep auto-encoders are used to learn the factor vectors that represent developers and open source projects. Finally, a sorting method is defined to provide personalized project recommendations.

In conventional GDM models, a group of experts express their individual preferences on a finite set of alternatives, then preferences are aggregated and the best alternative, satisfying the majority of experts, is selected. Nevertheless, in real situations, experts form their opinions in a complex interpersonal environment where preferences are liable to change due to social influence. In order to take into account the effects of social influence during the GDM process, we propose a new influence-guided GDM model based on the following assumptions: experts influence each other and the more an expert trusts in another expert, the more his opinion is influenced by that expert. The effects of social influence are especially relevant to cases when, due to domain complexity, limited expertise or pressure to make a decision, an expert is unable to express preferences on some alternatives, i.e., in presence of incomplete information. The proposed model adopts fuzzy rankings to collect both experts' preferences on available alternatives and trust statements on other experts. Starting from collected information, possibly incomplete, the configuration and the strengths of interpersonal influences are evaluated and represented through a social influence network (SIN). The SIN, in its turn, is used to estimate missing preferences and evolve them by simulating the effects of experts' interpersonal influence before aggregating them for the selection of the best alternative.

Modern VR/AR systems typically use head-mounted devices (i.e., headsets) to interact with users, and often store private user data, e.g., social network accounts, online transactions or even payment information. This poses significant security threats, since in practice the headset can be potentially obtained and accessed by unauthenticated parties, e.g., identity thieves, and thus cause catastrophic breach. In this paper, we propose a novel GaitLock system, which can reliably authenticate users using their gait signatures. Our system doesn't require extra hardware, e.g., fingerprint sensors or retina scanners, but only uses the on-board inertial measurement units (IMUs) equipped in almost all mainstream VR/AR headsets to authenticate the legitimate users from intruders, by simply asking them to walk a few steps. To achieve that, we propose a new gait recognition model Dynamic-SRC, which combines the strength of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), to extract unique gait patterns from the inertial signals during walking. We implement GaitLock on Google Glass (a typical AR headset), and extensive experiments show that GaitLock outperforms the state-of-the-art systems significantly in recognition accuracy (&gt; 98 percent success in 5 steps), and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained VR/AR headsets without incurring high energy cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8276563/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 May-June 2019,ieeexplore

It consists of the following two modules: (1) an anomaly detection module that leverages improved restricted Boltzmann machine and gradient descent-based support vector machine to detect the abnormal activities, and (2) an end-to-end data delivery module to satisfy strict QoS requirements of the SDN, that is, high bandwidth and low latency. Finally, the proposed scheme has been experimentally evaluated on both real-time and benchmark datasets to prove its effectiveness and efficiency in terms of anomaly detection and data delivery essential for social multimedia. Further, a large-scale analysis over a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)-based insider threat dataset has been conducted to identify its performance in terms of detecting malicious events such as-Identity theft, profile cloning, confidential data collection, etc.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8613868/,IEEE Transactions on Multimedia,March 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939403,Image Recommendation With Reciprocal Social Influence,IEEE,Journals,"Image recommendation plays an important role for exploring user potential interests in large-scale image sharing websites (e.g., Flickr and Instagram). Social relationships have been exploited to learn user preference, and shown their effectiveness. We argue that their performance improvement tends to be limited, as most existing approaches only consider the side of social influence from friends to a user. However, social influence is reciprocal per se as the preference of friends will be also influenced by the user herself. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for image recommendation (dubbed RSIM) by leveraging reciprocal social influence, and optimize the preferences of users and friends simultaneously. Specifically, we split images into three types: positive image by an active user, social image by her social friends, and negative image by neither of them. We contend that a user prefers positive image to social image, which is in turn better than negative image for relative preference learning. Two neural networks are designed to capture user and image representations by tags and visual features, respectively. The proposed model is evaluated on a real dataset crawled from Flickr. The experimental results show that better performance can be reached than the state-of-the-art social image recommendation models in terms of precision.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8824080/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Assigning proper tags to the visual content is key to the success of many applications such as image retrieval and content mining. Although recent years have witnessed many advances in image tagging, these methods have limitations when applied to high-quality and large-scale training data that are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic neighbor learning method based on user-contributed social image datasets that can be acquired from the Web's inexhaustible social image content. In contrast to existing image tagging approaches that rely on high-quality image-tag supervision, we acquire weak supervision of our neighbor learning method by progressive neighborhood retrieval from noisy and diverse user-contributed image collections. The retrieved neighbor images are not only visually alike and partially correlated but also semantically related. We offer a step-by-step and easy-to-use implementation for the proposed method.

To some extent, danmaku video provides emotional timing information and an innovative method to analyze video data. In the age of big data, studying the characteristics of danmaku and its emotional tendencies can not only help us understand the psychological characteristics of users but also feedback the effective information of users to video platforms, which can help the platforms optimize related short video recommendations so that it can provide a more accurate solution for the selection of audiences during video production. However, danmaku is different from traditional comments. Current emotion classification methods are only suitable for two-dimensional classification which are not suitable for danmaku emotion analysis. Aiming at the problems such as the colloquialism, diversity, spelling errors, structural non-linearity informal language on the Internet, diversity of social topics, and context dependency of emotion analysis of the danmaku data, this paper proposes an improved emotion analysis model based on Bi-LSTM model to classify the further four-dimensional emotions of Pleasure, Anger, Sorrow and Joy. Furthermore, we add tags such as comment time and user name to the danmaku information. Experimental results show that the improved model has higher Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score under the same conditions compared with the CNN and SVM.

However, the existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force model was improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments.

Among LBS technologies, we used the Bluetooth low energy beacon in our system, which consumes less energy and is embedded in many current smartphones and tablets. In particular, the fingerprinting method has become a prime choice in the design of IPS owing to its good location estimation and the fact that a line-of-sight from access points is not required. We propose an improved two-step fingerprinting localization using multiple fingerprint features to enhance the localization accuracy. The proposed system uses a propagation model to convert RSS of beacons to distance and estimate the weighted centroid (WC) of nearby beacons. The estimated WCs along with signal strength and rank of the nearby beacons are stored in the server database for localization instead of RSS from all the deployed beacons. First, the proposed system makes use of diverse fingerprinting features to increase localization accuracy that also reduces both the physical size of the database and the amount of data communication with the server in the execution phase; second, affinity propagation clustering minimizes the searching space of RPs and reduces the computational cost; third, exponential averaging is introduced to smooth the noisy RSS.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918810,Influence Maximization in Signed Social Networks With Opinion Formation,IEEE,Journals,"Influence maximization (IM) has been widely studied in recent years. Given fixed number of seed users and certain diffusion models, the IM problem aims to select proper seed users in a social networks such that they can achieve the maximal spread of influence. Most previous work assumes that there are only positive relationships between users, and thus users spread influence positively. However, negative relationships also universally exist in various social networks and are complementary to positive relationships in information diffusion. In this paper, the influence maximization problem is addressed in signed social networks that contain both positive and negative relationships. We propose a novel diffusion model called LT-S and two influence spread functions. The proposed LT-S model extends the classical linear threshold model with opinion formation that incorporates both positive and negative opinions and simulates information diffusion in real-world social networks. The influence spread functions under the LT-S model are neither monotone nor submodular which bring challenges to maximization. The RLP algorithm is proposed to tackle the issue, which is improved from R-Greedy algorithm by incorporating two proposed accelerating techniques, the live-edge based and propagation-path based techniques.

We consider the case when respondents may not always be truthful and some cost is taken for each query. Our goal is to quantify the necessary and sufficient budgets to achieve the detection probability 1- δ for any given 0 &lt;; δ &lt;; 1.

This theoretical analysis not only quantifies the budgets needed by practical estimation algorithms achieving a given target detection accuracy in finding the diffusion source, but also enables us to quantitatively characterize the amount of extra budget required in non-adaptive type of estimation, referred to as adaptivity gap.

Concretely, for a target user, we first search for his/her opposite users (together referred to as “enemy” hereafter); afterward, we infer the possible friends of the target user indirectly according to Social Balance Theory; finally, optimal services are recommended to the target user based on the derived possible friends of the target user.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979163,Joint Learning of Embedding-Based Parent Components and Information Diffusion for Social Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Diffusion on social networks refers to the phenomena that opinions are spread via connected nodes. Given a set of observed cascades, the underlying diffusion process can be inferred for social network analysis. Earlier studies for modeling the diffusion process often assume that the activation of a node depends independently on the activations of its neighbors (or called parent nodes). Nevertheless, the activation of a node also depends on the connectivity of its neighbors. For instance, the opinions from the neighbors of the same closely connected social group are often similar, and thus those neighbors exhibit similar influence. Some recent studies incorporate the structural dependency of neighbors as connected components, which allow more accurate diffusion models to be inferred. However, the effectiveness of such component-based models often depends on how the components are identified. Existing methods are not designed to directly preserve the local connectivity of neighbors. In this paper, we propose to incorporate network embedding to enhance the performance of component-based diffusion models in social networks. In particular, we embed nodes in a social network in a latent vector space with local connectivity of the nodes preserved. Parent component identification then becomes a clustering task in the embedding space. A united probabilistic framework is proposed so that the parent components and the component-based diffusion models can be inferred simultaneously using a two-level EM algorithm based on observed information cascades. For performance evaluation, we apply the proposed model to both synthetic and real world data sets with promising results obtained. The empirical results also show how the use of the embedding-based framework can enhance both the component identification and the diffusion model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9027935/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

The largest challenge of the IM problem is its NP-hardness, and most of the existing approaches are with polynomial time complexity, making themselves unscalable to very large networks. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose LAIM: a linear time iterative approach for efficient IM on large-scale networks. Our framework has two steps: 1) influence approximation and 2) seed set selection. In the first step, we propose an iterative algorithm to compute the local influence of a node based on a recursive formula and use the local influence to approximate its global influence. In the second step, the k influential seed nodes are mined based on the approximated influence in the first step. Based on our model, we theoretically prove that the proposed approach has linear time and space complexity. We further accelerate our algorithm with simple modifications and propose its fast version.

Existing studies on landmark retrieval focus on exploiting the geometries of landmarks for visual similarity matches. However, the visual content of social images is of large diversity in many landmarks, and also some images share common patterns over different landmarks. On the other side, it has been observed that social images usually contain multimodal contents, i.e., visual content and text tags, and each landmark has the unique characteristic of both visual content and text content. Therefore, the approaches based on similarity matching may not be effective in this environment. In this paper, we investigate whether the geographical correlation among the visual content and the text content could be exploited for landmark retrieval. In particular, we propose an effective multimodal landmark classification paradigm to leverage the multimodal contents of social image for landmark retrieval, which integrates feature refinement and landmark classifier with multimodal contents by a joint model. The geo-tagged images are automatically labeled for classifier learning. Visual features are refined based on low rank matrix recovery, and multimodal classification combined with group sparse is learned from the automatically labeled images.

This trend has contributed to foster various location based services deployed on social media, the success of which heavily depends on the availability and accuracy of users' location information. However, only a very small fraction of tweets in Twitter are geo-tagged. Therefore, it is necessary to infer locations for tweets in order to attain the purpose of those location based services. In this paper, we tackle this problem by scrutinizing Twitter user timelines in a novel fashion. First of all, we split each user's tweet timeline temporally into a number of clusters, each tending to imply a distinct location. Subsequently, we adapt two machine learning models to our setting and design classifiers that classify each tweet cluster into one of the pre-defined location classes at the city level. The Bayes based model focuses on the information gain of words with location implications in the user-generated contents. The convolutional LSTM model treats user-generated contents and their associated locations as sequences and employs bidirectional LSTM and convolution operation to make location inferences.

JPEG is the most popular image format, primarily due to its lossy compression. It is used by almost everyone, from individuals to large organizations, and can be found on almost every device (on digital cameras and smartphones, websites, social media, etc.).

Unfortunately, the fixed-price models which are commonly used by most clouds have several shortcomings, such as requesting users to specify and monitor their resources as well as being difficult to set prices. These shortcomings limit the usage of fixed-price models for service clouds and, thus, service providers with finite resource urgently need effective approaches to schedule and price user’s jobs, with the goal of social welfare maximization. In response to the need of service providers, this paper designs new auction mechanisms for service clouds, with unique features of job-oriented users, pleasingly parallel jobs, and soft deadline constraints. However, several challenges should be addressed when designing mechanisms, such as the NP-hardness of finding the optimal job scheduling and possible misreports of selfish users for private information. To deal with these challenges, we first propose a new randomized scheduling mechanism for optimally scheduling and pricing pleasingly parallel jobs in service clouds. This mechanism is truthful in expectation, while achieving <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-approximation to the social welfare. However, potential collusion among cloud users which may result in significant effects has been ignored by this mechanism. To handle the collusion problem, we further propose a collusion-resistant mechanism which achieves <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$(t,P)$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-truthful while scheduling and pricing jobs. Both of these two mechanisms are computationally efficient and individually rational, and they can schedule jobs in a way without preemption.

This situation brings very dangerous problems in social networks. One of these problems is hate speech detection (HSD) problem which is covering issues such as insults, swearing, humiliation, discrimination, exclusion, detest, abhor, blast, damn, and intolerance. These can be reactions to a person, a group, an organization, an order, or an event. Although few machine learning methods have been used in the literature to solve this important problem in online social media, the performance of the HSD models in terms of many metrics needs to be increased. In this study, an automatic HSD system based on metaheuristic methodology was proposed for better results in this new and important problem. In the proposed optimization approach, Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) algorithm and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm were designed for the HSD problem. This is the first attempt to use optimization algorithms as solution search strategies for automatic HSD. An efficient representation scheme and flexible fitness function were designed for this purpose. Many metrics can easily be embedded into the designed fitness function in order to be simultaneously optimized. Firstly, the basic natural language processing (NLP) steps were carried out. Feature extraction was performed using Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency (TF), and document vector (Word2Vec). Then, the performances of the proposed novel approaches were analyzed in detail on the three different real-world data. The obtained results were also checked against eight popular supervised machine learning algorithms, Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm, and state-of-the-art Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA). Considering the evaluation criteria for three sets of experiments, it was observed that the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and f-score results of the ALO and MFO algorithms were superior to machine learning methods. As a result of the experimental studies, the highest accuracy value was 92.1% for ALO, while this value was 90.7% for MFO. Other numerical values obtained in the study were given in the experiments and results section with tables and graphics in detail.

A specific problem that has recently spurred research interest is the so-called Social Circle Inference from Mobility data (SCIM), aiming at inferring relationships among users based on mobility data and without any explicit structured network information. The existing methods either require partial social ties or fail to model the implicit correlations between user links, thereby suffering from critical inference bias. We present a novel SCIM framework, called SCIM via self-Attention and Contextualized-embedding (SCIMAC) - a methodology capturing multiple aspects of users' check-in behavior and complex motion patterns of different users. Instead of directly applying the recurrent model on training user trajectories, the proposed method introduces a new module for context-aware check-in representation learning by adaptively incorporating the internal states of the recurrent layers, which is more effective than the context-independent check-in embedding used in existing social circle inference approaches. To model the underlying correlations between labels, SCIMAC leverages a more sophisticated label embedding technique to adjust the penalties for correlated users, enabling a better understanding of the user's hierarchy in the label space, and alleviating the inference bias. We empirically demonstrate that our SCIMAC model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8709700/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In general, before network data is published, sensitive relationships should be anonymized to prevent the compromise of individual privacy. To quantify the guarantee level of privacy-preserving mechanisms and mitigate users' privacy concerns, numerous studies concerning network data de-anonymization have been carried out. However, most existing studies focus on single-view data, and privacy protection for multi-view data that is ubiquitous in the era of big data has not been yet extensively explored. In this study, we are interested in answering the following question: Are the traditional privacy protection methods still valid for the anonymization of multi-view data? In this study, we propose a Multi-View Low-Rank Coding (MVLRC) based network data de-anonymization framework to assess the vulnerability of privacy protection techniques by accurately reconstructing a large portion of the original data. Specifically, the framework assumes that in principle, the target and auxiliary networks have common structural patterns, and they can be modeled together to infer the hidden structure of the target network. The essential components of our work include the following: (1) a robust network representation model for structural pattern learning; (2) the network representation based multi-view modeling of target network and auxiliary network; (3) the inference of the anonymized links via target network reconstruction. Experimental results on synthetic networks and three real-world networks demonstrate that auxiliary networks can be utilized by malicious adversaries for privacy inference attacks.

Recent efforts sidestep this limitation through retrieving users' locations by alternatively unifying user generated contents (e.g., texts and public profiles) and online social relations. Though achieving some progress, previous methods rely on the similarity of texts and/or neighboring nodes for user geolocation, which suffers the problems of: (1) location-agnostic problem of network representation learning, which largely impedes the performance of their prediction accuracy; and (2) lack of interpretability w.r.t. the predicted results that is crucial for understanding model behavior and further improving prediction performance. To cope with such issues, we proposed a Multiple-aspect Attentional Graph Neural Networks (MAGNN) - a novel GNN model unifying the textual contents and interaction network for user geolocation prediction. The attention mechanism of MAGNN has the ability to capture multi-aspect information from multiple sources of data, which makes MAGNN inductive and easily adapt to few label scenarios. In addition, our model is able to provide meaningful explanations on the UG results, which is crucial for practical applications and subsequent decision makings.

Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time. Learning-based prediction is attempted by training four classifiers: naïve Bayes, $k$ -nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine. Two independent set of experiments were conducted with oversights of bandwidth and destination prediction. Both the discrete and continuous valued predictors were involved in the training. Performance evaluation of the generated hypothesis in both the cases was conducted using tenfold cross validation. Combined analysis using the assorted combinations of attributes was conducted, and thereafter, the effect of each feature was evaluated through singular attribute portioning. This paper presents observations, which exhibit deviations from the conventional machine learning paradigms. An attempt to increase the prediction accuracy of the classifiers was made through the boosting ensemble methodology. However, miniscule addition in performance was achieved.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection.

Analyzing those data effectively and efficiently can help to promote the development and improve the service quality of CPSS applications.

Unfortunately, most existing co-clustering methods that mainly focus on dealing with static data become infeasible to fuse huge volume of multi-modal data in dynamic CPSS environments. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a parameter-free incremental co-clustering method to deal with multi-modal data dynamically. In the proposed method, the single-modality similarity measure is extended to multiple modalities and three operations, namely, cluster creating, cluster merging, and instance partitioning, are defined to incrementally integrate new arriving objects to current clustering patterns without introducing additive parameters. Moreover, an adaptive weight scheme is designed to measure the importance of feature modalities based on the intra-cluster scatters.

Methods: The risk scoring system is based on the idea of sequential hypothesis testing under an uncertain time horizon. The system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype.

Given the huge amount of sensitive data available in social network platforms, user privacy protection on social networks has become one of the most urgent research issues. As a traditional information stealing technique, phishing attacks still work in their way to cause a lot of privacy violation incidents. In a Web-based phishing attack, an attacker sets up scam Web pages (pretending to be an important Website such as a social network portal) to lure users to input their private information, such as passwords, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and so on. In fact, the appearance of Web pages is among the most important factors in deceiving users, and thus, the similarity among Web pages is a critical metric for detecting phishing Websites. In this paper, we present a new solution, called Phishing-Alarm, to detect phishing attacks using features that are hard to evade by attackers. In particular, we present an algorithm to quantify the suspiciousness ratings of Web pages based on the similarity of visual appearance between the Web pages. Since cascading style sheet (CSS) is the technique to specify page layout across browser implementations, our approach uses CSS as the basis to accurately quantify the visual similarity of each page element. As page elements do not have the same influence to pages, we base our rating method on weighted page-component similarity. We prototyped our approach in the Google Chrome browser.

A common approach in phishing is through the use of e-mail communication with an embedded hyperlink. The detection and mitigation of phishing attacks are a grand challenge due to the complexity of current phishing attacks. Existing techniques are often too time consuming to be used in the real world in terms of detection and mitigation time. Likewise, they employ static detection rules that are not effective in the real world due to the dynamics of phishing attacks.

The proposed DPI approach consists of two components: phishing signature classification and real-time DPI. Based on the programmability of SDN, we develop the store and forward mode and the forward and inspect mode to the direct network traffic by using an artificial neural network model to classify phishing attack signatures and design the real-time DPI so that PhishLimiter can flexibly address the dynamics of phishing attacks in the real world. PhishLimiter also provides better network traffic management for containing phishing attacks since it has the global view of a network through SDN.

Partial shading, nevertheless, is an essential problem which affects the productivity and life of PV plants. PV reconfiguration is known as a powerful technique to resolve this effect. It is achieved by rearranging the PV modules according to their temperature and levels of shade. Therefore, in this paper, we have utilized three simple population-based optimization algorithms that are known as the flow regime algorithm (FRA), the social mimic optimization algorithm (SMO), and the Rao optimization algorithm to dynamically restructure the PV array. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using several metrics such as fill factor, mismatch losses, percentage of power loss, and percentage of power enhancement. Besides, the results obtained are compared with a regular total-cross-tied (TCT) connection and recently published techniques such as the competence square (CS) and genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, to demonstrate the suitability of proposed approaches in real-time implementation, real-time irradiation data of a particular location are considered and fed into the proposed algorithms for effective shade dispersion. After successful shade dispersion, the total energy generated using the three proposed algorithms is calculated and compared with the TCT reconfigured system for one year. The presented energy calculations and revenue generation confirm that the power produced by the proposed FRA technique is 13% higher than that generated by the TCT configuration. Furthermore, the presented PV characteristics show a reduced number of multiple peaks in the system.

WS-MDL learns convolutional neural networks iteratively and selectively from “weak” emoticon labels, which are cheaply available and noise containing. In particular, to filter out the label noise and to capture the modality dependency, a probabilistic graphical model is introduced to simultaneously learn discriminative multimodal descriptors and infer the confidence of label noise.

By using accurate and valuable predicted information, we can create effective environments, provide suitable materials to perform activities better, and facilitate more efficient operations. In this study, we apply the long short-term memory, a variant of the recurrent neural network, to predict the enterprise social networks that are formed through information regarding a business system's operation. More precisely, we apply the multivariate multi-step long short-term memory model to predict not only the next activity and next performer, but also all the variants of a process-aware enterprise social network based on the next performer predictions using a probability threshold. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental evaluation on the real-life event logs and compare our results with some related researches. The results indicate that our approach creates a useful model to predict an enterprise social network and provides metrics to improve the operation of an information system based on the predicted information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9399143/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892949,Psychological Gender Express via Mobile Social Network Activities: An Experimental Study on a Gay Network Data,IEEE,Journals,"It is well known that the social network users' behavior can reflect their personal mental profiles. Therefore, in this paper, we conducted an experiment to study users' gender identity through a mobile social network. Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth, that is, one's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither. In general, a person's psychological gender cannot be observed from the external characteristics of people. And even if some user's attributes such as physical gender and age can be found in social networks, it is difficult to find out the psychological gender of users. Apart from the fact that it will be hidden as the user's privacy, the main reason is that users' behaviors in social networks have no direct relationship with psychological gender. In this paper, we choose a special mobile social network to get around these limitations. Specifically, this paper is based on a real-world large gay social network of more than 10 000 000 users. In this mobile social network, we can indirectly mark the psychological gender of users by their sexual orientation. We collect 1000 users, including their characters, followers, followees and the same data for their followers and followees. Then, we examine an extensive set of features that can be extracted from the data set and train some classifiers to automatically identify the user's psychological gender. In the special mobile social network, a user's psychological gender is related to his characteristics, which include his personal characteristics, dating preference, and so on. This paper mainly analyzes users' personal characteristics, triads, and triadic evolution to infer their psychological gender. The experiments show that all these features are indeed effective in the classification, and even the features considered in previous studies have different implications with gender identity on other social networks. And it turns out that psychological gender as a kind of privacy can be leaked by these unintentional behaviors, and so we give some practical suggestions at the end of this paper to protect users' privacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8611321/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In this paper, we investigate the problem of real-time spatio-temporal data publishing in social networks with privacy preservation. Specifically, we consider continuous publication of population statistics and design RescueDP-an online aggregate monitoring framework over infinite streams with w-event privacy guarantee. Its key components including adaptive sampling, adaptive budget allocation, dynamic grouping, perturbation and filtering, are seamlessly integrated as a whole to provide privacy-preserving statistics publishing on infinite time stamps. Moreover, we further propose an enhanced RescueDP with neural networks to accurately predict the values of statistics and improve the utility of released data. Both RescueDP and the enhanced RescueDP are proved satisfying w-event privacy.

Diverse kinds of trajectories from the sensor networks provide an unprecedented opportunity for intelligence analysis. The geographic co-movement pattern has rarely been used by the police force to infer social connections, although it has been prevalent in other fields. The previous studies have mainly focused on a singular form of trajectories with exact co-locations, and the spread of the co-locations is over-looked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting co-occurrence patterns over multiplex trajectories. Firstly, We constructed the foundation for the discovery of co-occurrence events, namely space-time resonance honeycomb. It consists of multiple polygonal zones over sensor networks. Secondly, we transform all trajectories into a series of space-time prisms, and co-location activities are recorded using a sliding window approach. Thirdly, we propose a novel feature: Geo-Spread, which captures the extent of the co-location spread. In the end, we combine multiple features and employ Random Forest to predict social connections. We conduct extensive experiments on both the public dataset and the real-world surveillance dataset.

In this paper, we aim at evaluating the latent influence of scholars to find academic rising stars, which refer to scholars that may have few papers and little impact currently, but he or she will become influential scholars in the future. Most of the current works focus on the assessment of rising stars. However, there exists a growth period for each scholar. It is unfair for young scholars with limited resources, who will make acquaintance at conferences and recommendations and who will learn from senior scholars. In this paper, we primarily propose StarRank, which is an improved PageRank method to calculate the initial values of rising stars, construct the social network via explicit and implicit links, and apply the neural network to predict scholars' rankings in the future.

The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm which combines the multimodel detections in mean-shift tracking. First, a likelihood probability which integrates detections and similarity to local appearance is defined. Then, an expectation-maximization (EM)-like mean-shift algorithm is derived under the ML framework. In each iteration, the E-step estimates the associations to the detections, and the M-step locates the new position according to the ML criterion. To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for multiperson tracking, an improved sequential strategy to perform the mean-shift tracking is proposed. Under this strategy, human objects are tracked sequentially according to their priority order. To balance the efficiency and robustness for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is selected. The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social robots. The vision system integrates stereo-based and histograms-of-oriented-gradients-based human detections, occlusion reasoning, and sequential mean-shift tracking. Various examples to show the advantages and robustness of the proposed system for multiperson tracking from mobile robots are presented. Quantitative evaluations on the performance of multiperson tracking are also performed.

Although the link prediction problem is not new, the challenge of how to exploit various existing network information, such as network structure data and node attribute data, to enable AI-style knowledge inference for large social networks still remains unsolved. In this paper, we design and implement a scalable framework that treats link prediction as knowledge reasoning using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). Differing from other probabilistic graphical models, MLNs allow undirected relationships with cycles and long-range (non-adjacent) dependency, which are essential and abound in social networks. In our framework, the prior knowledge is captured as the structure dependency (such as friendship) and the attribute dependency (such as social communities) in terms of inference rules, associated with uncertainty represented as probabilities. Next, we employ the random walk to discover the inference subgraph, on which probabilistic inference is performed, so that the required computation and storage cost can be significantly reduced without much sacrifice of the inference accuracy. Our extensive experiments with real-world datasets verify the superiority of our proposed approaches over two baseline methods and show that our approaches are able to provide a tunable tradeoff between inference accuracy and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7736107/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Feb. 2017,ieeexplore

However, the increased attack surface offered by the growing number of connected vulnerable devices and separation of SDN control and data planes could overturn the huge benefits of such a system. This article addresses the vulnerability of the trust relationship between the control and data planes. To meet this aim, we propose an edge computing-based Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), enabled by an external BaaS provider. The proposed solution provides verification of inserted flows through an efficient, edge-distributed, blockchain solution. We study two scenarios for the blockchain reward purpose: 1) information symmetry, in which the SDN operator has direct knowledge of the real effort spent by the BaaS provider and 2) information asymmetry, in which the BaaS provider controls the exposure of information regarding spent effort. The latter yields the so-called “moral hazard,” where the BaaS may claim higher than actual effort. We develop a novel mathematical model of the edge BaaS solution and propose an innovative algorithm of a fair reward scheme based on game theory that takes into account moral hazard. We evaluate the viability of our solution through analytical simulations. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to maximize the joint profits of the BaaS and SDN operator, i.e., maximizing the social welfare.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9170542/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"15 Feb.15, 2021",ieeexplore

As the most common format related to items in online social networks, short texts have always been disregarded by previous research on item recommendation. The sparse features and insufficient information in short texts render the extraction of features from short texts difficult. To address the problems of short text feature extraction and item recommendation, we introduce a sense-based word embedding method to enrich word features and aid in item topic extraction. The sense is used to demonstrate the semantic meaning of a word since each word contains different senses, and each sense can be used to describe various words. Thus, the sense is befitting to enrich the information of short texts and address the problem of polysemy. By combining topic distribution, social relationships, and users' interests and interactions, we propose a time-aware probabilistic model to profile a user's preference score on items. By predicting the user preference score at a future time interval, the items with top scores can be regarded as the recommended items. Different experiments on real-world datasets are deployed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of sense-based short text topic assignment and item recommendation in multiple languages. The prediction results also demonstrate that the model substantially outperforms the compared methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682139/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

It brings the real challenge to distinguish that what particular information is credible. Especially when user authenticity is hidden, due to the microblog’s anonymity feature. Low credibility content creates an imbalance in society. Therefore many research studies are conducted to assess automatic microblog’s credibility but the majority of them offer different concepts of credibility and the problem seems unresolved. Credibility is multi-disciplinary, hence there is no generalized or accepted credibility concept with all its necessary and detailed constructs/components. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the complete anatomy of information credibility from different disciplines. It is accomplished here through an in-depth and organized study of all the problem dimensions for the identification of comprehensive and necessary credibility constructs. The framework is also proposed based on the identified constructs. It adheres to these constructs and presents their inter-relationships. It is believed that the framework would provide the necessary building blocks for implementing an effective automatic credibility assessment system. The framework is generic to social media and specifically implemented for microblogs. It is completely transformed up to features level, in the context of microblogs. Regarding automatic credibility assessment, it is proposed after detailed analysis that the attempt should be made for hybrid models combining feature-based and graph-based approaches. It is observed that quite a few surveys in the literature focus on some limited aspects of microblogs credibility but no literature survey and fundamental study exists that consolidates the work done. To understand the broader domain of credibility and consolidate the work in this area that can lead us to a suitable framework, we explored the existing literature from different disciplines for the said objectives.

In recently proposed approaches, the sampling of nodes of a network is done by simulating random walk. The generated node samples are used to train a neural network to learn the contextual information through an embedding vector. This method has gained popularity as the embedding vector is produced from the primitive node adjacency information and has achieved an outstanding performance. In this article, a naive and scalable approach for generating the node samples based on the principle of goal-oriented greedy searching has been proposed. The generated node samples have low noisy structures, which can represent the relation of edges of the network in a better way, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, better representation of feature embedding of nodes of the network is generated from the samples.

Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort.

The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices.

We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8011466/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/TDSC.2020.3047399,"Towards Learning-Based, Content-Agnostic Detection of Social Bot Traffic",IEEE,Journals,"With the fast-growing popularity of online social networks (OSNs), the security and privacy of OSN ecosystems becomes essential for the public. Among threats OSNs face, malicious social bots have become the most common and detrimental. They are often employed to violate users' privacy, distribute spam, and disturb the financial market, posing a compelling need for effective social bot detection solutions. Unlike traditional social bot detection approaches that have strict requirements on data sources (e.g., private payload information, social relationships, or activity histories), this article proposes a method called BotFlowMon that relies only on content-agnostic flow-level data as input to identify OSN bot traffic. BotFlowMon introduces several new algorithms and techniques to classify social bot traffic from real OSN user traffic, including aggregating network flow records to obtain OSN transaction data, fusing transaction data to extract features and visualize flows, and an innovative density-valley-based clustering algorithm to subdivide each transaction into individual actions. The evaluation shows BotFlowMon can identify the traffic from social bots with a 96.1 percent accuracy, which, based on the worst case study on a testing machine, only takes no more than 0.71 seconds on average after it sees the traffic.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308962/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 Sept.-Oct. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIP.2019.2923051,Two-Level Approach for No-Reference Consumer Video Quality Assessment,IEEE,Journals,"Smartphones and other consumer devices capable of capturing video content and sharing it on social media in nearly real time are widely available at a reasonable cost. Thus, there is a growing need for no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) of consumer produced video content, typically characterized by capture impairments that are qualitatively different from those observed in professionally produced video content. To date, most of the NR-VQA models in prior art have been developed for assessing coding and transmission distortions, rather than capture impairments. In addition, the most accurate NR-VQA methods known in prior art are often computationally complex, and therefore impractical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose a new approach for learning-based video quality assessment, based on the idea of computing features in two levels so that low complexity features are computed for the full sequence first, and then high complexity features are extracted from a subset of representative video frames, selected by using the low complexity features. We have compared the proposed method against several relevant benchmark methods using three recently published annotated public video quality databases, and our results show that the proposed method can predict subjective video quality more accurately than the benchmark methods. The best performing prior method achieves nearly similar accuracy, but at substantially higher computational cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8742797/,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

However, very few of them are labeled (as fake or true news) by professionals in near real time. In order to achieve timely detection of fake news in social media, a novel framework of two-path deep semisupervised learning (SSL) is proposed where one path is for supervised learning and the other is for unsupervised learning. The supervised learning path learns on the limited amount of labeled data, while the unsupervised learning path is able to learn on a huge amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, these two paths implemented with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are jointly optimized to complete SSL. In addition, we build a shared CNN to extract the low-level features on both labeled data and unlabeled data to feed them into these two paths. To verify this framework, we implement a Word CNN-based SSL model and test it on two data sets: LIAR and PHEME. Experimental results demonstrate that the model built on the proposed framework can recognize fake news effectively with very few labeled data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9235489/,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2556724,Understanding Social Causalities Behind Human Action Sequences,IEEE,Journals,"Social causality study on human action sequences is useful and important to improve our understandings to human behaviors on online social networks. The redundant indirect causalities and unobserved confounding factors, such as homophily and simultaneity phenomena, contribute to the huge challenges on accurate causal discovery on such human actions. A causal relationship exists between two persons, if the actions of one person are significantly affected by the actions of the other person, while fairly independent of her/his own prior actions. In this paper, we design a systematic approach based on conditional independence testing to detect such asymmetric relations, even when there are latent confounders underneath the observational action sequences. Technically, a group of asymmetric independence tests are conducted to infer the loose causal directions between action sequence pairs, followed by another group of tests to distinguish different types of relationships, e.g., homophily and simultaneity. Finally, a causal structure learning method is employed to output pairwise causalities with redundant indirect causalities eliminated. Empirical evaluations on simulated data verify the effectiveness and scalability of our proposals. We also present four interesting patterns of causal relations found by our algorithm, on real Sina Weibo feeds, including two new patterns never reported in previous studies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7463496/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Aug. 2017,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845339,Using Social Media for Attendees Density Estimation in City-Scale Events,IEEE,Journals,"City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374412/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

Furthermore, we take advantages of the network representation learning technique on the vehicular ad hoc network for learning driver vectors. Finally, potential friends are recommended based on the similarity of driver vectors.

Easy and quick information proliferation is one of the reasons for its popularity. An extensive number of users with different age groups, gender, and societal beliefs are engaged in social media websites. Despite these favorable aspects, a significant disadvantage comes in the form of fake news, as people usually read and share information without caring about its genuineness. Therefore, it is imperative to research methods for the authentication of news. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-phase benchmark model named WELFake based on word embedding (WE) over linguistic features for fake news detection using machine learning classification. The first phase preprocesses the data set and validates the veracity of news content by using linguistic features. The second phase merges the linguistic feature sets with WE and applies voting classification. To validate its approach, this article also carefully designs a novel WELFake data set with approximately 72 000 articles, which incorporates different data sets to generate an unbiased classification output. Experimental results show that the WELFake model categorizes the news in real and fake with a 96.73% which improves the overall accuracy by 1.31% compared to bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) and 4.25% compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) models.

Predicting player performance fosters opportunities to cultivate heightened educational experiences and outcomes. However, predicting player's performance utilising player-generated MMD during their interactions with educational Motion-Based Touchless Games (MBTG) is challenging. To bridge this gap, we implemented an in-situ study where 26 users, age 11, played 2 maths MBTGs in a single 20-30 minute session. We collected player's MMD (i.e., gaze data from eye-tracking glasses, physiological data from wristbands, and skeleton data from Kinect) produced during game-play. To investigate the potential of MMD for predicting player's academic performance, we used machine learning techniques and MMD derived from player's game-play. This allowed us to identify the MMD features that drive rapid highly accurate predictions of players' academic performance in educational MBTGs. This might allow us to provide real-time proactive feedback to the player to support them through their educational gaming experience. Our analysis compared two data lengths corresponding to half and full duration of the player's question solving time. We showed that all combinations of extracted features associated with gaze, physiological, and skeleton data, predicted student performance more accurately than the majority baseline. Additionally, the most accurate prediction of player's performance derived from the combination of gaze and physiological data for both full and half data lengths.

The goal of image reconstruction based ECT is to locate the distribution of permittivity for the dielectric substances along the cross-section based on the collected capacitance data. In the ECT-based image reconstruction process: (1) the relationship between capacitance measurements and permittivity distribution is nonlinear, (2) the capacitance measurements collected during image reconstruction are inadequate due to the limited number of electrodes, and (3) the reconstruction process is subject to noise leading to an ill-posed problem. Thence, constructing an accurate algorithm for real images is critical to overcoming such restrictions. This paper presents novel image reconstruction methods using Deep Learning for solving the forward and inverse problems of the ECT system for generating high-quality images of conductive materials in the Lost Foam Casting (LFC) process. Here, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) models were implemented to predict the distribution of metal filling for the LFC process-based ECT. The recurrent connection and the gating mechanism of the LSTM is capable of extracting the contextual information that is repeatedly passing through the neural network while filtering out the noise caused by adverse factors.

Most spoof detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Consequently, the performance of any such spoof detector significantly degrades when encountering spoofs fabricated using novel materials not found in the training set. In real-world applications, the problem of fingerprint spoof detection must be treated as an open set recognition problem where incomplete knowledge of the fabrication materials used to generate spoofs is present at training time, and novel materials may be encountered during system deployment. To mitigate the security risk posed by novel spoofs, this paper introduces: 1) the use of the Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM), which is relatively robust for open set recognition, as a novel-material detector and a spoof detector and 2) a scheme for the automatic adaptation of the W-SVM-based spoof detector to new spoof materials that leverages interoperability across classifiers.

If those students do not learn how to model real systems using AI, they will be losing the opportunity of applying this powerful tool for solving several real problems in their professional life. Since the AI model can be a representation for forecasting the performance of the real model, this model can help the design process and provide information during its operation. This paper proposes an engineering project to teach artificial intelligence algorithms using real systems that are non-linear.

Moreover, this source could be classified as a renewable energy source. The basic generation of electrical energy is based on changing the magnetic field. Although the operation principle is basic, the electrical source has a non-liner description that is extremely complex so AI could be applied to create a model that represents those non-linear relationships in a precise manner.

Initially triggered by the need to handle dangerous and remote distance tasks such as nuclear materials manipulation and space exploration, bilateral teleoperation has found its way into other applications as a result of development of control theory, robotic technology (both hardware and software) and latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Consequently, bilateral teleoperation is found facing new challenges brought by these new applications. One major and obvious change is the working environment for the slave manipulator: different from rigid or solid contact environments which are reasonably assumed in early applications in industrial, nuclear and aerospace applications, the slave environment is now more complex and often the objects in contact are much softer in term of stiffness and can not be described by simple elastic model if good teleoperation performance (accurate and transparent) is expected. In this paper, the research of bilateral teleoperation system considering soft environment in recent 20 years has been surveyed for the first time in literature, to the knowledge of the authors. Following the difference in real applications, in this review the definition of soft environment covers linear elastic environment with much lower stiffness than conventional industrial environment and nonlinear complex soft environment with/out time-varying characteristics.

In this paper, we propose a solution: a low-cost and effective Smart Recycling Bin that utilizes the power of cloud to assist with waste classification. A centralized Information System (IS) collects measurements from smart bins that are deployed all around the city and classifies the waste of each bin using Artificial Intelligence and neural networks. Our implementation is capable of classifying different types of waste with an accuracy of 93.4% while keeping deployment cost and power consumption very low.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200283/,2020 9th International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST),7-9 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

We describe the development of a multi-ton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside human personnel, handling palletized materials within existing, busy, semi-structured outdoor storage facilities. The system has three principal novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal tablet that enables human supervisors to use speech and pen-based gestures to assign tasks to the forklift, including manipulation, transport, and placement of palletized cargo. Second, the robot operates in minimally-prepared, semi-structured environments, in which the forklift handles variable palletized cargo using only local sensing (and no reliance on GPS), and transports it while interacting with other moving vehicles. Third, the robot operates in close proximity to people, including its human supervisor, other pedestrians who may cross or block its path, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot and operate it manually.

A lookup table and k-nearest neighbors techniques are used to classify the surface material based on a database of previously known materials. This technique is low-cost and efficient in computation.

Specifically here, a complex problem in inbound logistics is considered as real-time scheduling in a stochastic shop floor problem. Recently, in order to comply with real-time decisions, autonomous logistic objects have been suggested as an alternative. Since pallets are common used objects in carrying materials (finished or semi-finished), so they have the possibility to undertake the responsibility of real time dispatching jobs to machines in a shop-floor problem. By insisting on the role of pallets for this task, their sustainment's advantage in manufacturing systems motivated the idea of developing learning pallets. These pallets may deal with uncertainties and sudden changes in the assembly system. Here, among some intelligent techniques artificial neural network is selected to transmit the ability of decision making as well as learning to the pallets, as distributed objects. Besides, pallets make decisions based on their own experiences about the entire system and local situations. Consequently, the considered scheduling problem resembles an open shop problem with three alternative finished products.

The requirement to control an increasing number of continuously changing processes is the cause of a transition from centralized to distributed and cooperative organizations. The consequence is a computer systems design integrated in the process of define/improve system models with a progressive approach too. To reach the described research objective we have developed a new approach to design a computer system.

CAS collects data from sensors that are at the specific coordinates of cells and it is the substrata for energy, materials and information flow representation. Events and Actions in a CAS are described using Event Calculus and the flow of fluents is interpreted on the basis of Collision-based computing paradigm. Trajectories approaching a collision site represent input values, and trajectories of localizations traveling away from a collision site represent output values. At this point we have a model of a real system as dynamic networks of fluents. This is represented using the language of flow pattern, inspired by F.

10.1109/ITherm51669.2021.9503247,Deep Learning to Enhance Transient Thermal Performance and Real-Time Control of an Energy Storage (TES) Platform,IEEE,Conferences,"Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are used for thermal energy storage (TES) due to their high latent heat capacity. While inorganic PCMs have the ability to store large amounts of thermal energy (as they possess higher values of latent heat capacity) they need significant supercooling to initiate solidification - which compromises their operational reliability (compared to organic PCMs). `Cold Finger Technique'/ CFT (wherein a portion of the PCM is maintained in the solid-state as the un-melted PCM serves to initiate nucleation for subsequent solidification of the rest of the PCM) enables higher operational reliability at the expense of a marginal loss of storage capacity (from the portion of the PCM that remains un-melted). In order to apply CFT, one possible approach is to target a desired melt fraction in the early stages of operation for avoiding catastrophic failure (i.e., avoiding 100% melting). The objective is to reach as close to 100% melting as possible - without completely melting the whole mass of PCM - using a reliable and predictable method. Hence, at any instant, a reliable way is desired to predict the time remaining to reach a particular melt fraction of the PCM (during the melting cycle).In this study we determine the efficacy of employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques, especially Deep Learning, for predicting the time remaining to reach a target melt fraction at any instant during the melting cycle. The time history of the PCM melt fraction and temperature transients at multiple locations within the TES platform can thus be correlated by employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to achieve this goal. The aim of this study is to develop and deploy ANN based prediction tools that can enable real-time predictions (e.g., when the melt cycle should be stopped and freezing cycle should be initiated) apriori based on instantaneous values of temperature measured during operation of a TES platform. The data for training and evaluating the efficacy of the ANN model predictions is obtained from PCM melting experiments performed in this study using PureTemp29. Initially a solid mass of PCM is melted (using a nichrome wire heater mounted at the bottom) in a graduated cylinder with three thermocouples recording the temperatures at distinct locations along the height of the cylinder. An automated digital data acquisition (DAQ) system is used to record the transient temperature profiles from these thermocouples. The height of the liquid meniscus (melted PCM) is recorded using a digital image acquisition apparatus (and also monitored periodically from the measuring cylinder containing the PCM) until the PCM is completely melted. The results show that the predictions of the ANN model are most accurate in the later stages of the melting cycle. The error decreases as the melt fraction approaches the target melt. For a target melt of 90%, the error in predictions in the last 1800 seconds of the melting cycle is in the range 150-350 seconds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9503247/,2021 20th IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (iTherm),1-4 June 2021,ieeexplore

Even for experienced drivers, manoeuvres with trailers, especially reversing can be complex and stressful. Thus driver assistance systems are very useful in these scenarios. They are typically achieved by a single rear-view fisheye camera perception algorithms. There is no public dataset for this problem and hence there is very little academic literature on this topic. This motivated us to present all the trailer assist use cases in detail and propose a deep learning based solution for trailer perception problems. Using our proprietary dataset comprising of 11 different trailer types, we achieve a reasonable detection accuracy using a lightweight real-time network running at 30 fps on a low power embedded system.

The teachers feel a lot of obstacles in implementing the curriculum 2013 which are related to the learning approach, learning methods, the creation of learning tools, the use of instructional materials, implementation of assessment, and other aspects. In addition, the constraints stemming from the students is the lack of student motivation in implementing the learning process, especially mathematics. This causes the level of student understanding becomes not meet the standards expected. To overcome this problem, the authors design and develop learning activities that focus on student activity, can motivate students to learn math and give them gradual understanding in math and reduce the workload of the teacher. Learning activity consists of playing educational games that are integrated with field activities and daily activities at home. The design of game content is based on a theme that developed into a mission or objective games.

However, classifying what VOC exists in the environment still remains as a complex task. Knowing what VOCs are in the air can help us remove the main cause that vents VOC materials in order to maintain clean air quality. In this work, we present VOCkit, an IoT sensor kit for non-chemical experts to easily detect and classify different types of VOCs. VOCkit combines miniature chemically-designed fluorometric sensors for recognizing VOCs with an embedded imaging system for classification. Exposing the fluorometric sensors with various VOCs, result in photophysical property change of each fluorescent compound, which composes the sensors, and the synergistic combination of the changes create unique individual fluorescent color patterns respectively to the VOC material. The fluorescent color change pattern is captured using a camera and the images are processed with machine learning algorithms on the embedded platform for VOC classification. Using 500 fluorometric sensor images collected for five different commonly contactable VOCs, we show the feasibility of performing VOC classification on small-sized IoT devices.

However, capturing the specialized needs of customers accurately is a difficult task because their needs depend on time, context, situation, and meaning. Recently, physical computational environments have been developing rapidly, thereby allowing easy implementation to sense a customer's action and deal with it sequentially. In this paper, we propose a personalized method to predict individual interests and demands appropriately. In particular, the system learns the customers' situation, meaning, and action from their action history, and reflects a feedback of the result to predict the next action. To realize this method, we utilize the following two methodologies: the mathematical model of meaning (MMM), which is a semantic associative search technology; and the local variational inference (LVI), which is an approximation of the Bayesian inference.

Errors during the manufacturing or the plies' overlapping, in fact, can cause particular flaws in the resulting material, so compromising its same integrity. Within this framework, ultrasonic tests could be useful to characterize the presence of defect, depending on its dimensions. On the contrary, the requirement of a perfect state for used materials is unavoidable in order to assure both transport reliability and passenger safety. Therefore, a real-time approach able to recognize and classify the defect starting from the finite element simulated ultrasonic echoes could be very useful in industrial applications. The ill-posedness of the so defined process induces a regularization method. In this paper, a finite element and a heuristic approach are proposed.

In order to implement predictive control for the HVAC system and natural ventilation, the model needs to have the capability to predict building thermal responses under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which would capture the effects of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. However, a deep neural network comes with a high demand for training data. In real-world applications, the target building may not have the necessary amount of operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could solve this dilemma. By freezing partial weights of a deep neural network model that is pretrained on multi-year data from a base case building, it can be quickly deployed to different buildings in other climates. With much fewer trainable parameters, the model can then be well-trained on only 15 days of data from the new target building. The base case and target case can have entirely different floor areas, building materials, and window sizes. This transfer learning model performs significantly better than a comparable model that is only trained on source data or target data, achieving high predicting accuracy on both indoor air temperature and relative humidity in the time horizon from 10 minutes to two hours. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building.

It is the ability of biometric system to distinguish between spoof and real biometric sample of person.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921432,From information revolution to intelligence revolution: Big data science vs. intelligence science,IEEE,Conferences,"The hierarchy of human knowledge is categorized at the levels of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence. For instance, given an AND-gate with 1,000-input pins, it may be described very much differently at various levels of perceptions in the knowledge hierarchy. At the data level on the bottom, it represents a 2<sup>1,000</sup> state space, known as `big data' in recent terms, which appears to be a big issue in engineering. However, at the information level, it just represents 1,000 bit information that is equivalent to the numbers of inputs. Further, at the knowledge level, it expresses only two rules that if all inputs are one, the output is one; and if any input is zero, the output is zero. Ultimately, at the intelligence level, it is simply an instance of the logical model of an AND-gate with arbitrary inputs. This problem reveals that human intelligence and wisdom are an extremely efficient and a fast convergent induction mechanism for knowledge and wisdom elicitation and abstraction where data are merely factual materials and arbitrary instances in the almost infinite state space of the real world. Although data and information processing have been relatively well studied, the nature, theories, and suitable mathematics underpinning knowledge and intelligence are yet to be systematically studied in cognitive informatics and cognitive computing. This will leads to a new era of human intelligence revolution following the industrial, computational, and information revolutions. This is also in accordance with the driving force of the hierarchical human needs from low-level material requirements to high-level ones such as knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence. The trend to the emerging intelligent revolution is to meet the ultimate human needs. The basic approach to intelligent revolution is to invent and embody cognitive computers, cognitive robots, and cognitive systems that extend human memory capacity, learning ability, wisdom, and creativity. Via intelligence revolution, an interconnected cognitive intelligent Internet will enable ordinary people to access highly intelligent systems created based on the latest development of human knowledge and wisdom.

Heretic hears, recognizes, and organizes unseen musical material from a human improviser into a fluid, coherent, and expressive musical language.

Beyond the real-time status update, utilizing vast IoT data and creating machine learning and optimization models provide us with intelligent business recommendations. Those are used by the site engineers and managers to make real-time decisions in a situation with multiple conflicting operational and business goals.

10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561878,MFPN-6D : Real-time One-stage Pose Estimation of Objects on RGB Images,IEEE,Conferences,"6D pose estimation of objects is an important part of robot grasping. The latest research trend on 6D pose estimation is to train a deep neural network to directly predict the 2D projection position of the 3D key points from the image, establish the corresponding relationship, and finally use Pespective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm performs pose estimation. The current challenge of pose estimation is that when the object texture-less, occluded and scene clutter, the detection accuracy will be reduced, and most of the existing algorithm models are large and cannot take the real-time requirements. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-directional Feature Pyramid Network, MFPN, which can efficiently integrate and utilize features. We combined the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with MFPN to design a new network for 6D pose estimation, MFPN-6D. At the same time, we propose a new confidence calculation method for object pose estimation, which can fully consider spatial information and plane information. At last, we tested our method on the LINEMOD and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust to textureless materials and occlusion, while running more efficiently compared to other methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561878/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),30 May-5 June 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00087,Mining the Critical Conditions for New Hypotheses of Materials from Historical Reaction Data,IEEE,Conferences,"The new findings in material science often require a high research cost for the following two aspects. First is that the chemical reaction craft needs continuous optimization and may consume lots of valuable reactants and apparatus during daily experiments. Second, the success of a designed experiment relies heavily on researchers' experience. With the starting of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, researchers are beginning to record historical reaction data, and seek new solutions via computer techniques, such as data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we study the reaction data of inorganic-organic hybrid materials from the Dark Reaction Project from Haverford College with simple machine learning algorithms (i.e., Bayes Net, SVM and C4.5), ensemble learning models (i.e., Random Forest, Stacking, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and XGBoost), and deep neural network models. Besides accuracy of the prediction models, we also analyze the reaction conditions that have important reflecting in chemistry with different ranking algorithms. With a series of evaluation, we find that the welldesigned stacking-based ensemble learning model can reach the highest prediction accuracy of 61% (8% higher than GBDT and 5% higher than XGBoost) on the top50 subsets based on 'symmetrical uncertainty ranking' on the standalone data set which was not used in the Dark Reaction Project before.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8560065/,"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)",8-12 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598612,Multiscale superpixel-based fusion framework for hyperspectral image classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Since it is usually difficult and time-consuming to obtain sufficient labeled samples in practice, the samll number of sample is one of the challenging issue for hyperspectral image classifiction. Fortunately, due to the spatial correlation of the surface of the materials, it is feasible to improve classification performance from the perspective of superpixel. In this paper, a multiscale superpixel-based fusion (MSSF) framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. First, several superpixel maps of different scales are generated from the hyperspectral images. Then, calculate the spectral mean of superpixels and each class of training sample, the label of the superpixel is determined by the label of the training sample which distance is closest to the superpixel. Finally, we use majority voting strategy to determine the final label of each pixel. The experimental results on two real HSI data sets show that the performance of the proposed framework is better than support vector machine(SVM), K nearest neighbor(KNN), sparse representation-based classifier(SRC).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8598612/,2018 Fifth International Workshop on Earth Observation and Remote Sensing Applications (EORSA),18-20 June 2018,ieeexplore
10.23919/SCSE.2019.8842762,Novel machine learning ensemble approach for landslide prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Haphazard development activities on mountain slopes and inadequate attention to construction aspects have led to the increase of landslides and consequently sustaining damage to lives and infrastructure. Nearly 3275 sq.km of area spread over the Ratnapura District, seems to be highly prone to landslides and mass wastage of 2178 sq.km. Landslides occur in many regions of Ratnapura district and nearly 90 deaths have been reported according to National Research Building Organization (NBRO) in 2017. Most landslides or potential failures could be predicted fairly accurately if proper investigations were performed in time. The primary objective of this study is landslide-hazard mapping and risk evaluation to determine the real extent, timing, and severity of landslide processes in Ratnapura district. Such knowledge will provide the most significant benefit to government officials, consulting engineering firms, and the general public in avoiding the landslide hazard or in mitigating the losses. Hybrid Machine Learning techniques can be used to develop prediction models using existing data. Ensemble approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes model were combined and implemented for the final prediction. This study possesses a strong capability to predict landslides by causative factors, slope, land use, elevation, geology, soil materials and triggering factor; rainfall was extracted and applied to the machine learning algorithms. This research introduces a novel architecture to produce a more relevant and accurate prediction of the landslide vulnerability within the study area.

This led us to the development of the EDNA drone, an aerial robotics solution designed to equip first responders in high-risk settings with lifesaving-edge tools for situational awareness and non-lethal conflict resolution. The EDNA is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that delivers the patent-pending “Predictive Probable Cause” technology. The EDNA drone is designed to provide automated real-time analysis to assist teams entering high-risk situations where gun violence may occur. By leveraging machine learning, biometric sensors, and advanced materials in the field and routing feedback to an intuitive augmented-reality interface, the EDNA will provide autonomous threat detection and bullet-stopping capabilities wherever those features are needed--to groups such as Police and Sheriff's Departments, Fire Departments, and EMT and emergency rescue teams. Data from the EDNA drone's sensors is fed to machine learning algorithms running on the drone in real-time. Through a neural network trained on past data, the EDNA is able to detect the presence and location of firearms and explosives, even through walls or other obstacles. Through the use of advanced metal foams and composite materials, the armored drone can even stop bullets-functionality which has obvious benefits for humanitarian deployment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8601597/,2018 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC),18-21 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

The problem appears in many engineering applications including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing systems where the governing equation for tension is nonlinear. Currently known methods for the nonlinear output regulation problem either require the solution of a constrained partial differential equation or the preview information of the signal to be tracked. In this paper, we consider the problem of regulating web tension while rejecting periodic disturbances and use a novel approach to synthesize feedforward control as the solution of a system of differential-algebraic equations, which is considerably less complex and suitable for practical implementation. We assume that the disturbance signal is the output of a known exogenous system with unknown initial conditions. A parameter identification scheme to estimate the unknown initial conditions is developed. The proposed technique is successfully applied to web tension regulation in a large R2R machine which contains real-time hardware and software that is used in industrial practice. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed scheme under various experimental conditions, including different web speeds and materials.

This is a principle of the recent most advanced texture representation, the bidirectional texture function (BTF). Multispectral BTF is a seven-dimensional function that depends on view and illumination directions as well as on planar texture coordinates. BTF is typically obtained by measurement of thousands of images covering many combinations of illumination and viewing angles. However, the large size of such measurements has prohibited their practical exploitation in any sensible application until recently.

The stencil cleaning operation is necessary to reduce printing defects. The proper control of the cleaning profiles selection process determines the quality and efficiency of the SPP. The wet profile provides high-quality cleaning but requires more time and materials. Dry cleaning is more efficient but cannot provide adequate cleaning quality with high levels of residue. This research aims to develop an intelligent model to guide the stencil cleaning profiles’ decision-making and improve the SPP performance. Stencil cleaning is considered a sequential detection problem. Based on the historical printed boards’ quality measures, a novel feature space is proposed by encoding the time-series printing data into images to better understand the abnormal and trend patterns. The resultant images are classified into the proper cleaning profile through a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model, denoted as cleaning profile classification (CPC) model. Transfer learning is adopted to overcome the limited data problem and enhance the model’s generalization capabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed CNN architecture outperforms other complex state-of-the-art CNN structures in accurately classifying the cleaning profiles, which enhances the overall SPP quality and productivity.

The goal of image reconstruction based ECT is to locate the distribution of permittivity for the dielectric substances along the cross-section based on the collected capacitance data. In the ECT-based image reconstruction process: (1) the relationship between capacitance measurements and permittivity distribution is nonlinear, (2) the capacitance measurements collected during image reconstruction are inadequate due to the limited number of electrodes, and (3) the reconstruction process is subject to noise leading to an ill-posed problem. Thence, constructing an accurate algorithm for real images is critical to overcoming such restrictions. This paper presents novel image reconstruction methods using Deep Learning for solving the forward and inverse problems of the ECT system for generating high-quality images of conductive materials in the Lost Foam Casting (LFC) process. Here, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) models were implemented to predict the distribution of metal filling for the LFC process-based ECT.

In this paper, we present a novel, fast probabilistic model-based algorithm for realistic BTF modeling allowing an extreme compression with the possibility of a fast hardware implementation. Its ultimate aim is to create a visual impression of the same material without a pixelwise correspondence to the original measurements. The analytical step of the algorithm starts with a BTF space segmentation and a range map estimation by photometric stereo of the BTF surface, followed by the spectral and spatial factorization of selected subspace color texture images. Single mono-spectral band-limited factors are independently modeled by their dedicated spatial probabilistic model. During rendering, the subspace images of arbitrary size are synthesized and both color (possibly multispectral) and range information is combined in a bump-mapping filter according to the view and illumination directions.

Participating media has a translucent aspect that comes from light being scattered inside the material. For materials with a small mean-free-path (mfp), multiple scattering effects dominate. Simulating these effects is computationally intensive, as it requires tracking a large number of scattering events inside the material. Existing approaches precompute multiple scattering events inside the material and store the results in a table. During rendering time, this table is used to compute the scattering effects. While these methods are faster than explicit scattering computation, they incur higher storage costs. In this paper, we present a new representation for double and multiple scattering effects that uses a neural network model. The scattering response from all homogeneous participating media is encoded into a neural network in a preprocessing step. At run time, the neural network is then used to predict the double and multiple scattering effects.

To mitigate the security risk posed by novel spoofs, this paper introduces: 1) the use of the Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM), which is relatively robust for open set recognition, as a novel-material detector and a spoof detector and 2) a scheme for the automatic adaptation of the W-SVM-based spoof detector to new spoof materials that leverages interoperability across classifiers. Experiments conducted on new partitions of the LivDet 2011 database designed for open set evaluation suggest: 1) a 97% increase in the error rate of the existing spoof detectors when tested using new spoof materials and 2) up to 44% improvement in spoof detection performance across spoof materials when the proposed adaptive approach is used.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180344/,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,Nov. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/TMECH.2014.2366033,Output Regulation of Nonlinear Systems With Application to Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems,IEEE,Journals,"This paper deals with the problem of synthesizing feedforward control to aid the regulation of output of a nonlinear system in the presence of partially known exogenous inputs. The problem appears in many engineering applications including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing systems. Currently known methods for this problem either require the solution of a constrained partial differential equation or the preview information of the signal to be tracked. The novelty of this paper lies in synthesizing feedforward control as the solution of a system of differential-algebraic equations, which is considerably less complex and suitable for practical implementation. In this paper, we consider the problem of regulating the output while rejecting the disturbances and apply it to R2R manufacturing systems. The problem of tracking reference signals can also be handled with the suggested technique. We assume that the disturbance signal is the output of a known exogenous system with unknown initial conditions. A parameter identification scheme to estimate the unknown initial conditions is developed. The proposed technique is successfully applied to control of web tension in a large R2R machine which mimics most of the features of industrial R2R machines and contains real-time hardware and software that is used in industrial practice. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed scheme for web tension control under various experimental conditions, including different web speeds and materials. We will present and discuss the representative experimental results with the proposed technique and provide a comparison with an industrial PI control scheme to highlight the benefits of using the proposed scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6963413/,IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,June 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3090300,Particle Filter Reinforcement via Context-Sensing for Smartphone-Based Pedestrian Dead Reckoning,IEEE,Journals,"Pedestrian dead reckoning based on particle filter is commonly used for enabling seamless smartphone-based indoor positioning. However, compass directions indoor are heavily distorted due to the presence of ferromagnetic materials. Conventional particle filters convert the raw compass direction to a distribution adding a constant variance noise and leveraging a particle swarm to simulate the distribution. Finally, the selection of eligible directions is performed applying external constraints mainly imposed from the indoor map. However, the choice of a constant parameter decreases the positioning performances because the variance of nearby context, including topography, ferromagnetic materials, and particle distribution, is not represented. Therefore, we propose the particle filter reinforcement able to adaptively learn and adjust the variance of the direction observing the context in real-time. Experiments in real-world scenarios show that the proposed method improves the positioning accuracy by more than 20% at the 80% probability compared with state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9458270/,IEEE Communications Letters,Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

By discovering process models and analyzing social network metrics created throughout the operation of the information system, we can better understand the roles of performers and characteristics of activities, and more easily predict what will occur in the next operation of a system. By using accurate and valuable predicted information, we can create effective environments, provide suitable materials to perform activities better, and facilitate more efficient operations. In this study, we apply the long short-term memory, a variant of the recurrent neural network, to predict the enterprise social networks that are formed through information regarding a business system's operation. More precisely, we apply the multivariate multi-step long short-term memory model to predict not only the next activity and next performer, but also all the variants of a process-aware enterprise social network based on the next performer predictions using a probability threshold. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental evaluation on the real-life event logs and compare our results with some related researches.

EHT has two critical challenges when applied to deep-seated tissue heating, i.e., the temperature might not be accurately measured and the magnetic field intensity decreases with increasing depth. The finite-element method (FEM) is suitable for coupled analysis with electromagnetic fields and heat transfer, which can be used to predict temperature profiles in deep tissue implanted with magnetic materials. To improve the accuracy of the FEM model, an adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is implemented on the basis of measured data and simulated data, which were generated by the FEM model.

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data. HMAA is believed to have allowed individuals to visualize and conceptualize abstract ideas that would have been otherwise challenging using static models.

Deep learning, as one viable way to carry out big-data-driven modeling and analysis, could be integrated in IIoT systems to aid the automation and intelligence of IIoT systems. As deep learning requires large computation power, it is commonly deployed in cloud servers. Thus, the data collected by IoT devices must be transmitted to the cloud for training process, contributing to network congestion and affecting the IoT network performance as well as the supported applications. To address this issue, in this article, we leverage the fog/edge computing paradigm and propose an edge computing-based deep learning model, which utilizes edge computing to migrate the deep learning process from cloud servers to edge nodes, reducing data transmission demands in the IIoT network and mitigating network congestion. Since edge nodes have limited computation ability compared to servers, we design a mechanism to optimize the deep learning model so that its requirements for computational power can be reduced. To evaluate our proposed solution, we design a testbed implemented in the Google cloud and deploy the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model, utilizing a real-world IIoT data set to evaluate our approach.<sup>1</sup> Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, which cannot only reduce the network traffic overhead for IIoT but also maintain the classification accuracy in comparison with several baseline schemes.<sup>1</sup>Certain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this article in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately.

Despite the large body of research works already reported, current key technological challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD robotic learning is introduced in this paper, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) (and especially the Deep Learning (DL)) field, by establishing a Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes (implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled learning methodologies for modelling the multi-level inter-dependencies among the robotic tasks.

10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00134,A Reinforcement Learning Scheduling Strategy for Parallel Cloud-Based Workflows,IEEE,Conferences,"Scientific experiments can be modeled as Workflows. Such Workflows are usually computing-and data-intensive, demanding the use of High-Performance Computing environments such as clusters, grids, and clouds. This latter offers the advantage of elasticity, which allows for increasing and/or decreasing the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand. Workflows are typically managed using Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS). Many existing SWfMSs offer support for cloud-based execution. Each SWfMS has its own scheduler that follows a well-defined cost function. However, such cost functions must consider the characteristics of a dynamic environment, such as live migrations and/or performance fluctuations, which are far from trivial to model. This paper proposes a novel scheduling strategy, named ReASSIgN, based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). By relying on an RL technique, one may assume that there is an optimal (or sub-optimal) solution for the scheduling problem, and aims at learning the best scheduling based on previous executions in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. For this, an extension of a well-known workflow simulator WorkflowSim is proposed to implement an RL strategy for scheduling workflows. Once the scheduling plan is generated, the workflow is executed in the cloud using SciCumulus SWfMS. We conducted a thorough evaluation of the proposed scheduling strategy using a real astronomy workflow.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8778368/,2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW),20-24 May 2019,ieeexplore

Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.

One of the most effective ways to analyze the dusts is via their interaction and interference on some background light. The observable extinction curves and spectral features carry the information about the size and composition of the dusts. Among the features, the broad 2175 Å absorption bump is one of the most significant spectroscopic interstellar extinction features. Traditionally, astronomers apply conventional statistical and signal processing techniques to detect the existence of absorption bumps. These approaches require labor-intensive preprocessing and the co-existence of some other reference features to alleviate the influence from the noises. Conventional approaches not only involve substantial labor cost in complicated workflows, but also demand well-trained expertise to make subtle and error-prone conditional decisions. In this paper, we propose to leverage deep learning to automate the detection workflow without minute feature engineering. We design and analyze deep convolutional neural networks for detecting absorption bumps. We further propose the framework of deep learning mechanisms and models (collectively called DeepSky) for scientific discovery in astronomy.

Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhDresearch is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types.

We tested the algorithms against simulated images with known ground truth and real images from three different domains (medical ultrasound, scanning electron microscope, and astronomy). For the real images, we employed experts to delineate the ground truth for each domain. Techniques borrowed from machine learning robustly assessed the performance of the methods (area under curve and cross validation). As a practical application, we used the proposed method to label a set of 5000 ultrasound images.

Two different approaches are presented based on SMOS brightness temperature and SMOS neural network soil moisture data assimilation, respectively. For the first approach, SMOS brightness temperature data assimilation relies on forward modelling. Long term results, spanning the SMOS period, of SMOS forward modelling, monitoring and data assimilation are presented. They emphasize the relevance of SMOS data for monitoring and to support NWP model developments. For the second approach, a SMOS soil moisture product has been produced based on a Neural Network (NN) trained on ECMWF soil moisture. So, the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product captures the SMOS signal variability in time and space, while by design its climatology is consistent with that of the ECMWF soil moisture, which makes it suitable for data assimilation purpose. This approach, initially tested for 2012 in a global scale stand alone approach, shows that SMOS NN data assimilation slightly improves the two-metre air temperature forecast in the short range at regional scale. For NWP applications this approach has been further developed with a near real time production of the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product, with the implementation of the SMOS NN data assimilation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and with high resolution (9km) global scale testing compatible with the current ECMWF NWP system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8519369/,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,22-27 July 2018,ieeexplore
