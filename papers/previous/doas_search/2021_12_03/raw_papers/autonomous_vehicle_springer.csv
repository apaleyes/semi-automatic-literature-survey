Rule-based autonomous driving systems may suffer from increased complexity with large-scale intercoupled rules, so many researchers are exploring learning-based approaches. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied in designing autonomous driving systems because of its outstanding performance on a wide variety of sequential control problems. However, poor initial performance is a major challenge to the practical implementation of an RL-based autonomous driving system. RL training requires extensive training data before the model achieves reasonable performance, making an RL-based model inapplicable in a real-world setting, particularly when data are expensive. We propose an asynchronous supervised learning (ASL) method for the RL-based end-to-end autonomous driving model to address the problem of poor initial performance before training this RL-based model in real-world settings. Specifically, prior knowledge is introduced in the ASL pre-training stage by asynchronously executing multiple supervised learning processes in parallel, on multiple driving demonstration data sets. After pre-training, the model is deployed on a real vehicle to be further trained by RL to adapt to the real environment and continuously break the performance limit. The presented pre-training method is evaluated on the race car simulator, TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator), to verify that it can be sufficiently reliable in improving the initial performance and convergence speed of an end-to-end autonomous driving model in the RL training stage. In addition, a real-vehicle verification system is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed pre-training method in a real-vehicle deployment. Simulations results show that using some demonstrations during a supervised pre-training stage allows significant improvements in initial performance and convergence speed in the RL training stage.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1631/FITEE.1900637,springer

The bulk of research today seems to focus on setting up the required software and hardware systems, alongside policies and transportation infrastructure. A gap is seen to exist within the realm where the passengers and vehicle AI interface. This calls for research in developing capabilities for the AI in AVs a form of social transactions that are more familiar to human beings, taking cues from natural conversations and body language signals. The reason for this is that autonomous vehicles not only need to perform navigational duties, but also need to communicate, respond, and reciprocate in a social manner. This would give the AI the dignity they deserve when performing their functions, as performing these activities accords with the capabilities of a self-aware, intelligent being.

To this end, we propose two complementary to each other approaches: (i) identify in real time, with minimal computational cost, traffic conditions, (ii) localize, classify vehicles and approximate traffic variables (volume, speed, density) on a road segment from video captured by UAVs. Both problems are formulated as classification problems and tackled using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The use of pre-trained CNNs is also investigated. Both approaches are, then, analysed based on their accuracy and feasibility in implementation. Findings indicate that all models developed achieve a detection accuracy of 89% and higher. The CNN with the best performance can classify traffic conditions between constrained and unconstrained traffic with 91% accuracy higher than what a pretrained model achieved and with significantly faster training times. Furthermore, findings indicated that pretrained neural network for traffic localization was able to predict the position and type of vehicles with a precision of 0.91. Based on the fundamental traffic diagram, it was shown that the two approaches provide compatible results and a feasible representation of traffic on the study area.

Yet, full autonomous vehicles are not on public roads. Elon Musk Elon Musk , speaking at an event during the first half of 2020, stated that his firm will be able to present a fully autonomous vehicle technology by the end of the year. This statement is met with skepticism, especially because several of the challenges that existed have not been solved. Road traffic laws have not been adjusted to face the reality of driving by an autonomous machine. The only way that full autonomous vehicles can hit public roads is through test procedures. There also exists quite some uncertainty on who should be liable for accidents with autonomous vehicles. Accidents may occur, and this is something that adversarial machine learning Adversarial machine learning is showing. Even with the best set of sensors, the interpretation of the sensed environment may be misinterpreted.

Firstly, we obtain the cell partition by K-means algorithm. Then, we find the optimal 3D position for each UAV in each cluster to provide low delay service. Finally, when users are roaming, the UAVs are still able to track the real-time users.

Over 33,000 Americans are killed in car accidents every year and lots of those accidents are often avoided by implementing the autonomous vehicle detection. Different ways are developed to manage and detect the road obstacles with the help of the techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence. To resolve the issues associated with the existing vehicle detection like vehicle type recognition, low detection accuracy, and slow speed, many algorithms like the fast and faster region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) are implemented but those were not supportive in real time because of the speed at which they compute and its two-step architecture with the faster RCNN, which is the enhanced version of RCNNs that runs at a speed of 7 frames per second. As it is observed that the CNN family has two steps (object detection and classification), which can reduce the response time in real time with good accuracy and high image resolution. So, the vehicle detection model like YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 is taken into consideration in this paper as they are very useful in real-time detection with a comparatively higher frame rate. As YOLO family of algorithms will mostly use the single step detection and classification. YOLO has an FPS rate of 45 which is pretty good in the real-time scenarios.

Due to limited intelligence, these UAVs can only operate at high altitudes, leading to the use of expensive and heavy sensors for obtaining important health information of the plants. To fly at low altitudes, these UAVs must possess the capability of obstacle avoidance to prevent crashes. However, most current obstacle avoidance systems with active sensors are not applicable to small aerial vehicles due to the cost, weight, and power consumption constraints. To this end, this paper presents a novel approach to the autonomous navigation of a small UAV in tree plantations only using a single camera. As the monocular vision does not provide depth information, a machine learning model, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), was trained for the tree trunk detection. A control strategy was implemented to avoid the collision with trees. The detection model uses image heights of detected trees to indicate their distances from the UAV and image widths between trees to find the widest obstacle-free space. The control strategy allows the UAV to navigate until any approaching obstacle is detected and to turn to the safest area before continuing its flight. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithms by carrying out 11 flight tests in real tree plantation environments at two different locations, one of which is a new place. All the successful results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and robust for autonomous navigation in tree plantations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10846-020-01284-z,springer

By focusing on reducing complexity and accelerating the replanning problem under strict dynamical constraints, we employ the b-spline theory with local support property for defining the high dimensional agile flight trajectories. We utilize the differential flatness model of an aerial vehicle, allowing us to directly map the desired output trajectory into input states to track a high dimensional trajectory. Dynamically feasible replanning problem is addressed through regenerating the local b-splines with control point reallocation. As the geometric form of the trajectory based on the location of the control points and the knot intervals, the control point reallocation for fast replanning with dynamical constraints is turned into a constrained optimization problem and solved through deep reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology enables generating dynamically feasible local trajectory segments, which are continuous to the existing, hence provides fast local replanning for collision avoidance. The DRL agent is trained with different environmental complexities, and through the batch simulations, it is shown that the proposed methodology allows to solve fast trajectory replanning problem under given or hard dynamical constraints and provide real-time applicability for such collision avoidance applications in agile unmanned aerial vehicles.

A realistic scenario is considered where the UAV commutes between stations at high-speeds, experiences a single motor failure while surveying an area, and thus requires to land safely at a designated secure location. The proposed challenge is viewed solely as a control problem. A hybrid control architecture – an artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted proportional-derivative controller – is able to learn the system dynamics online and compensate for the error generated during different phases of the considered scenario: fast and agile flight, motor failure, and safe landing. Firstly, it deals with unmodelled dynamics and operational uncertainties and demonstrates superior performance compared to a conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller during fast and agile flight. Secondly, it behaves as a fault-tolerant controller for a single motor failure case in a coaxial hexacopter thanks to its proposed sliding mode control theory-based learning architecture. Lastly, it yields reliable performance for a safe landing at a secure location in case of an emergency condition. The tuning of weights is not required as the structure of the ANN controller starts to learn online, each time it is initialised, even when the scenario changes – thus, making it completely model-free. Moreover, the simplicity of the neural network-based controller allows for the implementation on a low-cost low-power onboard computer.
