A steadily increasing trend of obesity is not only limited to developed countries, but to developing nations as well. As smartphones have rapidly gained mainstream popularity, mobile applications (apps) are used in public health as intervention to keep track of diets, activity as well as weight, which is deemed more accurate than relying on user's self-report measure, for the sake of weight management. A solution called “Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System” (SWITCHes) is developed to facilitate objective data reception and transmission in a real-time manner. Based on the user data acquired from SWITCHes app and the auxiliary data from medical instruments, not only SWITCHes app can engage user with tailored feedback in an interactive way, in terms of artificial intelligence-powered health chatbot, but the healthcare professional can provide the more accurate medical advice to user also.

Automation and digitalization of marine vessels involve smart digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect ships' health data and send it over to a central processing location where this data is analyzed. However, it is difficult to apply this to the shipping industry due to offshore data transmission bandwidth challenges.

IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations.

10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset have been performed and the results show improvements of our proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8531143/,"2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)",17-20 Sept. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/AERO.2005.1559665,Health monitoring: new techniques based on vibrations measurements and identification algorithms,IEEE,Conferences,"Purpose of the paper is to present an innovative application inside the nondestructive testing field based on vibrations measurements, developed, at the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" (Italy), by the authors during the last three years, and already tested for analysing damages of many structural elements. The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system. These techniques promise to bring a step forward for the implementation of an automatic ""health monitoring"" system which will be able to identify a structural damage in real time, improving the safety and reducing maintenance costs",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1559665/,2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference,5-12 March 2005,ieeexplore

To provide this demand, HealthMate system is proposed as a solution for real-time health monitoring system that is based on Smart Wearable System for Health Monitoring (SWSHM). This paper is aimed at providing a health monitoring system for patients to measure their body parameters through e-Health sensors via smart phone and enabling doctors to check the health status of their patients remotely.

The face is automatically detected and tracked, then the raw signal is calculated from each frame over a 10-seconds sliding window.

Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem.

10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2010.8851,Improving activity classification for health applications on mobile devices using active and semi-supervised learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile phones' increasing ubiquity has created many opportunities for personal context sensing. Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction. Thus, democratic co-learning would be the best choice for most applications, since it would significantly increase the accuracy for initial classifiers that performed poorly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5482296/,2010 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,22-25 March 2010,ieeexplore

Acceptable performance of such infrastructures, and hence the availability of online services, rely on a very large number of parameters such as per-process resources and configurable system/application parameters. These parameters are available for collection as performance counters distributed across various machines, but services have had a hard time determining which performance counters to monitor and what thresholds to use for performance alarms in a production environment. In this paper, we present a novel framework called PerfAnalyzer, a storage-efficient and pro-active performance monitoring framework for correlating service health with performance counters. PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment.

In this paper we report on our efforts to develop a real-time, real-world pain detection system from human facial expressions. Although many studies addressed this challenge, most of them use the same dataset for training and testing. There is no cross-check with other datasets or implementation in real-time to check performance on new data. This is problematic, as evidenced in this paper, because the classifiers overtrain on dataset-specific features. This limits realtime, real-world usage. In this paper, we investigate different methods of real-time pain detection. The training data uses a combination of pain and emotion datasets, unlike other papers. The best model shows an accuracy of 88.4% on a dataset including pain and 7 non-pain emotional expressions. Results suggest that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are not the best methods in some cases as they easily overtrain if the dataset is biased.

10.1109/INDIANCC.2016.7441102,Sensor health monitoring using simple data driven approaches,IEEE,Conferences,"Present day high end vehicles contain as many as 100 microprocessors and have more than 100 million lines of code [3]. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7441102/,2016 Indian Control Conference (ICC),4-6 Jan. 2016,ieeexplore

We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets.

Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements.

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data.

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results.

These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS.

Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to assess the health statuses of hard drives based on the gradually changing sequential SMART attributes. Compared to a simple failure prediction method, a health status assessment is more valuable in practice because it enables technicians to schedule the recovery of different hard drives according to the level of urgency.

The proposed quality-aware ECG monitoring system consists of three modules: 1) ECG signal sensing module; 2) automated signal quality assessment (SQA) module; and 3) signal-quality aware (SQAw) ECG analysis and transmission module. The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices. The proposed quality-aware IoT paradigm has great potential for assessing clinical acceptability of ECG signals in improvement of accuracy and reliability of unsupervised diagnosis system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7857776/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,June 2017,ieeexplore

Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the industrial revolution that mainly focuses on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of components in the industrial process is one of the crucial and important component of Industry 4.0. SHM of components exposed to high-temperature (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim 650^{\circ }\text{C}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) is becoming increasingly important nowadays. However, harsh and high temperature environments impose a great challenge towards their implementation. This review is an attempt to demonstrate the development, application, limitations and recent advancement of the existing sensors used for SHM. Some sensors such as eddy current (EC) sensors and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have been discussed in detail. A phenomenological study of the electromagnetic sensor for the SHM of engineering components that are exposed to high temperature has been addressed. State-of-the-art fabrication methodologies such as low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology for such type of sensors for high temperature SHM applications have been elucidated.

In conjunction with researchers from civil engineering and computer science, this article studied a fundamental problem motivated from practical IoT-based BSHM: how to effectively prolong network lifetime while guaranteeing desired coverage. Integrating a promising reinforcement learning model named learning automata (LA) with confident information coverage (CIC) model, this article presented an energy-efficient sensor scheduling strategy for partial CIC coverage in IoT-based BSHM system to guarantee network coverage and prolong network lifetime. The proposed scheme fully exploits cooperation among deployed nodes and alternatively schedules the wake/sleep status of nodes while satisfying network connectivity and partial coverage ratio. Especially, the proposed scheme takes full advantage of the LA model to adaptively learn the optimal sensor scheduling strategy and significantly extend network lifetime. A series of comparison simulations using real data sets collected by a practical BSHM system strongly verify the effectiveness and energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

10.1109/JBHI.2016.2525006,Resource-Aware Mobile-Based Health Monitoring,IEEE,Journals,"Monitoring heart diseases often requires frequent measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at different periods of the day, and at different situations (e.g., traveling, and exercising). This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth. Compared to several greedy but nonoptimal solutions, the execution time of our approach was at least 10 times faster and consumed 90% less energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7397814/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,March 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,IEEE,Journals,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682194,1-D Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Processing Applications,IEEE,Conferences,"1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become the state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications such as patient-specific ECG classification, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the ""Big Data"" scale in order to prevent the well-known ""overfitting"" problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical background.

The non-invasive nature of peripheral physiological signal measurement via wearables enables ecologically valid long-term monitoring. These peripheral signal measurements can be used in real-time in many ways including health and emotion classification. This paper investigates the utility of peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition using the publicly available DEAP database. Using this database (which contains electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and peripheral signals), this paper compares eight machine learning models in the classification of valence and arousal emotion dimensions. These were applied to the peripheral physiological signals only. These models operate on three groupings of the peripheral data: (i) the raw peripheral physiological signals; (ii) individual feature sets extracted from each peripheral signal; and (iii) a fusion data set made of the combined features from the individual peripheral signals. The results indicate that support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression give the best recognition results on all three data groups considered. The feature fusion data set, which is made up by fusing all the features from the peripheral signals, gives the best recognition accuracy on both valence and arousal dimensions. In addition, subject dependency for emotion classification from peripheral signals is examined and significant individual variability is observed.

Vestibular disorders and their complications have become one of the most common health problems worldwide. Patients with vestibular disorders not only feel uncomfortable in daily living but also have higher risk of stroke. Because of the popularity of vestibular disorders, a good screening method can significantly save resources for hospitals and society. Currently, there are three vestibular disorder diagnostic methods including hearing tests, eye movement tests, and balance tests. The first two methods are sensitive and accurate. However, they require complicated and costly equipment. Among balance test methods, observing the body sway in several postures is a good choice when the testing time needs to be shortened; nonetheless, diagnostic results strongly depend on subjective evaluations of doctors. This paper contributes a solution by introducing a computer-aided method for quantitatively measure the degree of swaying. The proposed algorithm can process real time video captured by a camera, detect two colored stickers attached on the shirt, and calculate the inclination of the patient body. Many sub-processes have been utilized to enhance the measurement accuracy and method applicability. Experiments were performed with a mannequin and human bodies. Results show that angles measured by the proposed method and the reference data are almost equal. The plotted results show remarkably differences between healthy volunteers and patients. This means that the proposed system could provide a useful basis for screening and contribute an important step towards applying machine learning in vestibular disorders diagnosis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9352088/,2020 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Communications and Electronics (ICCE),13-15 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore

Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display. The Service-Terminal was completed by the mixed programming of Myeclipse and Matlab software, and Tomcat was used as the Server. It mainly implements the functions of image receiving, image preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier modeling. The MySQL was used to establish two databases: the “Disease Characteristics Database” and the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base”. Finally, through samples testing and validating, the Android-based mobile terminal can real-time collect the image of Fusarium head blight and upload the server. After the target image was processed and compared by the “Disease Characteristics Database”, the appropriate diagnostic knowledge was selected from the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base” and feedbacked to the client. In summary, the results of this study showed that it was helpful for the rapid and non-destructive investigation of infected FHB in the field, and it would provide a reference for the study of other crop diseases, facilitate the application and development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in agriculture.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8820529/,2019 8th International Conference on Agro-Geoinformatics (Agro-Geoinformatics),16-19 July 2019,ieeexplore

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one of the effective ways to decrease this transmission is wearing masks in crowded places. However, monitoring people by police is a weary and difficult process. Thanks to the improvement in technology and artificial intelligence that make task became easier. In this paper, a simple mask recognition model based on texture and color moments features is proposed. This model is deployed in two stages: first, texture and color moments features from the face image (31 features) are extracted using a hybridization between texture features and color moments features techniques. In order to extract the texture features, the image transformed into Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) then 22 statistical metrics were calculated. So as to extract the color moments features, the first, second and third moments have been calculated from each layer of the RGB image. Second, based on the extracted features, the images are classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model (MLP). The dataset used in this research consists of 1787 real images with masks and 1918 without masks.

The effects of poor or deprived sleep can have a major impact on the daily, healthy functioning of the human body and can lead to serious health issues. Current, prevalent tests can be expensive, cumbersome and not conducive to long-term monitoring of sleep.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery. The novelty of this work shows, the method to predict the future power demand by updating its model parameters and without any initial SoC calculation.

PD monitoring is a promising approach that ensures the reliable performance of electrical assets through condition based maintenance. Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to discover features and specific patterns that can differentiate between partial discharges and noise. On-line PD monitoring systems have been recently deployed for continuously assessing the equipment health, so that its maintenance requires minimal cost and shorter disruption to operational services. However, labelled data is required in order to build predictive models for on-line PD monitoring. Labelled data is expensive to obtain since it requires expert input. In addition, in real scenarios the ratio of noise pulses to real PDs can be high, making the learning task harder.

In this paper, we take the first strides on (1) investigating methods of generating adversarial example in the context of HAR systems; (2) studying the vulnerability of activity recognition models to adversarial examples in feature and signal domain; and (3) investigating the effects of adversarial training on HAR systems. We introduce Adar<sup>11</sup>Software code and experimental data for Adar are available online at https://github.com/rameshKrSah/Adar., a novel computational framework for optimization-driven creation of adversarial examples in sensor-based activity recognition systems. Through extensive analysis based on real sensor data collected with human subjects, we found that simple evasion attacks are able to decrease the accuracy of a deep neural network from 95.1% to 3.4% and from 93.1% to 16.8% in the case of a convolutional neural network. With adversarial training, the robustness of the deep neural network increased on the adversarial examples by 49.1% in the worst case while the accuracy on clean samples decreased by 13.2%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8942124/,2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD),4-7 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICTer51097.2020.9325474,Adjusting The Hard Level on Game by a Prediction for Improving Attraction and Business Value,IEEE,Conferences,"The computer gaming industry has become more popular among the young generation over the years. It became a sport and According to past studies, people choose computer games over physical games (outdoor games) due to their busy lifestyles which crack social relationships and fear of injuries. There are around 2.2 billion gamers around the world. Out of the assessed 7.6 billion individuals living on earth, as of July 2018, that implies nearly 33% of individuals on this planet are gamers. Out of those 2.2 billion gamers, 1.2 billion of the players play PC game. An online survey was conducted to collect information from random game players and non-game players scattered throughout Sri Lanka to identify the problems faced by them when playing the games and why others do not play the game or are discouraged to play games. 354 participants participated in this survey. In which 127 of the participants were Female and 227 Male. The participation age range was identified as 15 to 49 Years. The research team was able to summarize that 80.04% of the participants play games while 19.06% don't play games. Out of the participants who play games, 9.08% are pro players while the rest of the 78% of players are intermediate players. We identified that the main problems faced by most of the players are as follows: Some missions are too easy and boring or players getting stuck in the middle of the level because the level is too hard or because the mission is too hard to complete. The Popularity of games can be varied according to the players' skill level. Tasks of a game can be boring if it's too easy for a skilled player. On the other hand, if it's too hard for a beginner level player, it may tend to give up the game. The other problem identified was the inability of game character customization as per the preference of 92.07% of gamers who participated in the survey. According to their responses, we were able to understand the problems that they faced while playing the game and what they expect in a game. Therefore, the research team proposes a game that changes the level of hardness/complexity of the level according to the players' mood automatically. In simple terms, the game will `adjust and adopt' based on the user's emotions. The next level will be automatically designed based on the player record of the previous level using an algorithm that takes the emotions as inputs. To achieve this, the gamer's heart pulse rate, facial expression, and speed of using the controls are captured and analysed to obtain the most accurate emotion level of the player using machine learning. The level of emotions is taken along with the parameters such as age, gender, and haptic feedback to adjust the hardness level of the level.It is important to identify the player skill level to understand the user's experience as a gamer. To determine a player's skill level in the background, a keylogger captures the pressed key and the time it takes to press the key. It is also necessary to identify the emotional state of the player to provide a unique user experience to the player and it can be done in two ways which are facial expression and heart-pulse. Facial expression detection results in identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individual such as happiness, anger, and neutral which will be necessary for the adaptive game, and also the emotional range of a player is predicted. Additionally, age, gender, and face-shape are determined. The dataset is trained using machine learning to detect the facial expression and identify the emotion, age, gender, and face-shape of the individual. The Facial Expression of the player will be captured in real-time from the web camera of the computer and the emotion will be identified automatically as well as the age gender and face-shape. The other method is through Heart pulse, Heart pulse also can be used to detect the emotions of the player. There are 3 types of emotion levels Happy, Fear, Neutral. To do this, the heart rate sensor is used to capture the player's heart rate. According to the output received after training the dataset using machine learning algorithms and the skill level output is used to adjust the level of the game while the gamer is playing the game. To obtain a much more accurate emotional level, the heartbeat level, and the facial emotional level are analysed together. We have created a new model for analysing the above data using linear regression. Using the said model, the gender, age, the skill level of the player as well as the difficulty in the level of the game can be identified. The next level of the game will be designed using the data from the previous level and this process will continue until the player quits the game. A model is trained by using machine learning technology to predict character characteristics (moving speed, health regenerating) of the game character. The difficulty level of the player is taken as input for the training process. The output characteristics are given by an in-game module and adjust the characteristics of the game character until the player quits playing. The AI algorithm performs the process of reflecting the characteristics of the player to the in-game character. Age, gender, and face-shape are used as input data. The algorithm process input data to generate a unique set of variables. The variables manipulate the appearance of the in-game character until the player quits playing. Our game is developed within three months; therefore, it is difficult to predict the emotions or obtain a skill level like in an existing commercialized game because the demo game doesn't evoke any emotions or measure the skill level of the player. So, we have tested our application with the other similar existing games and we were able to obtain an accurate emotion and skill level. Even though the game is designed in a way to change the levels and character abilities based on the inputs obtained, we can't do so in other existing games. Therefore, the player records obtained from the games we tested were taken into a text record and analysed separately. Based on the analysed data we were able to obtain an accuracy level of 68%.In the future, the demo game will be further developed and tested with our system to obtain an emotion. The option of changing the game character based on the player's appearance is 75% successful, in which face-shape and gender were used. In the future, we will be using age as well. In the future a profile can be designed based on skill level, therefore making it possible to adjust the game based on a player's past record.This system provides a solution to problems faced by the game players such as the game being too easy and boring or hard and stressful. This can also prevent health issues that can be caused when a person gets too angry or violent and stress.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325474/,2020 20th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer),4-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

With the increasing number of social media usage, a trend has been observed of users creating posts related to adverse drug reactions (ADR). Mining social media data for these information can be used for pharmacological post-marketing surveillance and monitoring. However, the development of automatic ADR detection systems remains challenging because the corpora compiled from real world social media were usually highly imbalanced resulting in barriers to develop classifiers with reliable performance. In this work, we implemented a variety of imbalanced techniques and compared their performance on two large imbalanced data sets released for the purpose of detecting ADR posts. Comparing with state-of-the-art approaches developed for the two dataset, based on much less features, the developed classifiers with implemented imbalanced classification techniques achieved comparable or even better F-scores.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8588467/,2018 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI),30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

As time went by, the farmers started using herbicides to kill the weeds. The excessive usage of weedicides can cause severe health problems to the agricultural workers/farmers, can also contaminate the soil and the water. New methods have to be introduced to reduce the usage of weedicide. Even after the advancement in research, a lot of readily available solutions are not being implemented at the grass-root level. Addressing the problem, a better solution has been proposed to minimize the usage of the herbicide by classifying the plant images into the weed and the crop for selective spraying of the herbicide. The first step towards it is to differentiate between the crops and the weed. Image Classification Technique has been implemented using the Deep Learning function. A maximum efficiency of 96.3% was achieved with just 250 images of each plant in the dataset. The proposed model may easily be dumped in the Raspberry Pi and the selective spraying may be performed with the help of an attached sprayer.

Smart-phones are used in personal health care or monitoring activities of elderly persons. These types of smartphone applications require continuous authentication of the user for taking action in case of detachment of the smartphone from the user due to forgetfulness or theft. Continuous authentication on smartphone requires authentication process having low computational overhead. In this work, the objective is to develop low cost user authentication algorithm from time series data of user activities taken from sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope. Deep neural networks are used for user authentication. A two-step authentication process has been developed in which sensor data has been first classified into different activities and activity dependent authentication is proposed. For lowering computational cost of classifier, knowledge distillation is used to reduce the model parameters. Fine tuning is used to cope with the limited number of training data. As a result the authentication accuracy has been improved by 5% to 10%, also authentication time of 0.032 sec has been achieved which is useful for real time authentication.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

With the rise of artificial intelligence deep learning in recent years, various analytical software resources have gradually become easier to obtain. At the same time, wearable cyber physical sensors are becoming more and more popular. Measurements on vital signs such as heartbeat, electrocardiogram, and blood oxygenation blood pressure values are ubiquitous. We propose an integrated system that combines dialysis big data deep learning analysis with cross platform physiological sensing. We specifically tackle the early warning of dialysis discomfort such as hypotension, hypertension, cramps, etc., this requires a large amount of data collection, related training, data sources including dialysis treatment process and home physiological data. Although the Dialysis machine is able to produce huge amount of IoT data, the usable data for early warning system training is not as huge due to the limited physician labors devoted for labeling questionable samples. This generally leads to low accuracy for regular CNN training methods. We enhance the AI training performance via a transfer learning technique. The AI training accuracy reaches the value of 99% with the help of transfer learning, while that of an original CNN process on the HD data bears a low 60% accuracy. Given the high prediction accuracy of our AI engine, we are able to integrate the real time measurements from Dialysis machine with wearable devices such as ECG sensors and wrist health watches, and make precision prediction of incoming discomfort during the HD treatments.

Water pollution is a major environmental problem in India. The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage. Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry that results in polluting, most of the rivers, lakes and surface water in India. In this paper, An IoT Based Smart Water Quality Monitoring System using Cloud and Deep Learning is proposed to monitor the quality of the water in water-bodies. In conventional systems, the monitoring process involves the manual collection of sample water from various regions, followed by laboratory testing and analysis. This process is ineffective, as this process is arduous and time-consuming and it does not provide real-time results.

The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time.

10.1109/AERO.2015.7118976,An efficient way to enable prognostics in an onboard system,IEEE,Conferences,"Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems are becoming increasingly important for monitoring and maintaining high value assets. In order to enable real time onboard diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, mechanisms for reading, manipulating and analyzing the data need to be architected into the onboard system. Machine learning and statistical algorithms provide tools to develop data models for enabling prognostics that are typically developed off-board by mining historical data. Once trained, the logic of processing real time data is then embedded on a real time onboard system. A straightforward approach for incorporating the knowledge and intelligence for real time data processing is to add the needed logic and algorithms as an integral part of the onboard software. While this method can serve the purpose of enabling real time health assessment and analysis, it is very restrictive in nature. Every time the analytics need to be updated or algorithms need refinement, it requires a refresh of the complete onboard software. The ability to fine tune onboard embedded logic for the purpose of making the analysis smarter is crucial for creating a successful and sound health monitoring system. In addition, it is desired that the process of encoding logic and algorithms should be simple and easy to incorporate into the system. User friendliness of the process of embedding intelligent logic is critical for long term maintenance of the system as well. This paper discusses an approach to build algorithms and logic into an onboard system such that they are programmatically decoupled from the onboard software. The approach described in this paper allows users the ease of use and flexibility in building knowledge into the system.

However, there are only a few air monitoring stations in a city, which make it difficult to precisely measure PM2.5 concentration at the place without installation of air monitor. In this paper, we consider the PM2.5 inference problem and propose a model taking the PM2.5 nonlinear characteristic into account based on support vector machine (SVM). We collect the features of meteorology, geographical locations and PM2.5 indexes observed by air monitoring stations. Unlike the previous work, we add points of interest (POIs) feature and reduce its dimension by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model due to its sparsity and adopt wavelet decomposition to improve the inference accuracy.

Identifying patients with high readmission risk and paying additional attention to them can ease the burden on both patients and society. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to personalized readmission predictions, i.e., building an independent model for each target patient. However, existing personalized predictive models can be easily affected by data insufficiency and provide poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose the CLusterbased mUlti-task lEarning model (CLUE) to achieve personalized hospital readmission prediction. CLUE groups patients into different clusters based on a multi-angle similarity metric to preserve the interrelated information of patients with highly similar clinical behaviors. Due to different group characteristics of patients, the clusters of patients are imbalanced. Given that, CLUE treats the hospital readmission prediction for each cluster of patients as one task and learns multiple tasks jointly by parameter sharing mechanisms. In this way, not only can the data insufficiency problem be alleviated by supplementing individual models with the shared information from other clusters, but also the specific information of each cluster can be preserved for personalization. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of electronic health records, and show that CLUE significantly outperforms competitive comparative methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9313562/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),16-19 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/IS.2006.348406,Case-Based Decision Support for Intelligent Patient Knowledge Management,IEEE,Conferences,"The majority of healthcare workers in hospitals continue to record, access and update important patient information using paper charts. Disparate patient data (clinical information, laboratory results and medical imagery) is entered by different caregivers and stored at different locations around the hospital. This is a cumbersome, time consuming process that can result in critical medical errors such as documents being mislaid or prescriptions being misinterpreted due to illegible handwriting. Hospitals everywhere are moving to integrate health data sources using electronic health record (EHR) systems as well as taking advantage of the flexibility and speed of wireless computing to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare. We are developing a mobile application that allows doctors to efficiently access accurate real-time patient information at the point-of-care. The system can assist caregivers in automatically searching through very large repositories of previous patient cases as increasingly large hospital databases are making manual searches of such information unfeasible. The system performs computational prognosis by providing decision support for pre-screening of medical diagnosis. A presenting patient's symptoms can be input to a portable device and the application can quickly retrieve the most similar profiles with known diagnoses from large databases which can be used to compare treatments, diagnosis, test results and other information",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4155413/,2006 3rd International IEEE Conference Intelligent Systems,4-6 Sept. 2006,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICDARW.2019.30060,Character Keypoint-Based Homography Estimation in Scanned Documents for Efficient Information Extraction,IEEE,Conferences,"Precise homography estimation between multiple images is a pre-requisite for many computer vision applications. One application that is particularly relevant in today's digital era is the alignment of scanned or camera-captured document images such as insurance claim forms for information extraction. Traditional learning based approaches perform poorly due to the absence of an appropriate gradient. Feature based keypoint extraction techniques for homography estimation in real scene images either detect an extremely large number of inconsistent keypoints due to sharp textual edges, or produce inaccurate keypoint correspondences due to variations in illumination and viewpoint differences between document images. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for aligning scanned or camera-captured document images using character based keypoints and a reference template. The algorithm is both fast and accurate and utilizes a standard Optical character recognition (OCR) engine such as Tesseract to find character based unambiguous keypoints, which are utilized to identify precise keypoint correspondences between two images. Finally, the keypoints are used to compute the homography mapping between a test document and a template. We evaluated the proposed approach for information extraction on two real world anonymized datasets comprised of health insurance claim forms and the results support the viability of the proposed technique.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8892840/,2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops (ICDARW),22-25 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

The method can be implemented in real time using facial video analysis. The experiments were done with images extracted from a 12 min HD video collected in laboratorial normalized settings (TechSport from the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro) with a static camera (90° angle with face and camera). The time slot for video to extract images for a particular class of exercise intensity is correspondence to the incremental heart rate. The facial expression recognition has been performed mainly in two steps: facial landmark detection and classification using the facial landmarks. Luxand application was used to detect 70 landmarks were detect using the adaptation of code available in Luxand application and we applied machine learning classification algorithms including discriminant analysis, KNN and SVM to classify the exercise intensities from the facial images. KNN algorithms presents up to 100% accuracy in classification into 2 and 3 classes.

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations.

In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can only make diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named as DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), balances precision-explainability trade-off. Specifically, features and temporal information will be encoded in different stages of our model. Second, to explain the decision of the model, we adopt the gradient-based methods to generate features and temporal saliency maps highlighting which kind of features and time steps are key for the model's predictions. At last, we conduct the experimental studies in the CWRU bearing fault diagnosis dataset to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9261638/,"2020 International Conference on Sensing, Measurement & Data Analytics in the era of Artificial Intelligence (ICSMD)",15-17 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9216881,Deep Learning for Early Damage Detection of Tailing Pipes Joints with a Robotic Device,IEEE,Conferences,"In the mining industry, it is usual to employ several kilometers of pipes to carry tailing from the plant to a dam. Only in the Salobo Mine, a copper operation in the Amazon forest from Vale S.A., there are more than three and a half kilometers of tailing pipes. Since the material passing through the tailing pipe causes an abrasion effect that could lead to failures, regular inspections are needed. However, given the risky environment to perform manual inspections, a teleoperated or autonomous robot is a crucial tool to keep track of the pipe health. In this work, we propose a deep-learning methodology to process the data stream of images from the robot, aiming to detect early failures directly on the onboard computer of the device in real-time. Multiple architectures of deep-learning image classification were evaluated to detect the anomalies. We validated the early damage detection accuracy and pinpointed the approximate location of the anomalies using the Class Activation Mapping of the networks. Then, we tested the runtime for the network architectures that obtained the best results on different hardware to analyze the need for a GPU onboard in the robot. Moreover, we also trained a Single Shot object Detector to find the boundaries of the pipe joints, which means that the anomaly classification is performed only when a joint is detected. Our results show that it is possible to build an automatic anomaly detection system in the software of the robot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216881/,2020 IEEE 16th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),20-21 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

Many systems have been applied in sensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures which affect human well-being or health. Before deploying an AI system, it is necessary to validate its behavior and guarantee that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. For this reason, it is important to comprehend specific aspects of such systems. For example, understanding how neural networks produce final predictions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing work on interpreting neural network predictions for images via feature visualization often focuses on explaining predictions for neurons of one single convolutional layer. Not presenting a global perspective over the features learned by the model leads the user to miss the bigger picture.

However, wearable devices having real-time cardiac health monitoring aids individuals as well as medical professionals in the timely diagnosis of fatal heart diseases, such as arrhythmia.

A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, antilockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore

The introduction of auto milking systems makes management of farms and udder health more efficient and auto detection systems for common diseases in dairy farms, which are implemented auto milking systems and detect the diseases based on some measurements while milking, are needed. In this study, we propose a novel model for subclinical mastitis detection. Our dataset was collected from dairy farms in Japan and labeled using risk values calculated by a commercially available milk analyzer based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in order to train our model. Several measurements that can be obtained from any auto milking system, such as electrical conductivity in milk, were used as time series features. The models were trained using machine learning (a support vector machine or random forest) and their performances were compared. Our model detects the onset of subclinical mastitis with an accuracy of 81% in terms of sensitivity and 46% precision. In addition, some cases of subclinical mastitis can be detected earlier than when using an alert system based on LDH. Our model can be expected to be improved and utilized in real dairy farms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9450258/,2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),26-28 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks.

Epidemiological data analysis plays a crucial role in disease prevention and control. Conventional methods such as moving average or autoregressive analysis normally require the assumption of stationarity, which is often violated in epidemiologic time series. This paper proposes the fusion of neural networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms, with the aim to strengthen the modeling power for epidemiological dynamics. We deploy an additive fuzzy system into a neural network architecture in order to incorporate recurrent nodes to enable the fuzzy system to handle temporal data. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy rule structure before supervised training is applied to adjust parameters. As epidemiological time series exhibit complex behavior and possibly cyclic patterns, the addition of recurrent nodes to the fuzzy system improves the modeling capability. The proposed model dominates the benchmark feedforward neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model regarding modeling performance.

We are among the first to explore the impact of sensing diversity on sensor collaboration, exploit diversity for sensing confidence, and apply diversity exploitation for confident sensing coverage. We show that our diversity-exploiting confident coverage problem is NP-hard for any specific deployment and present a practical solution, Wolfpack. Through a distributed and iterative sensor collaboration approach, Wolfpack maximizes a specific deployment's capability to meet user detection requirements and save energy by powering off unneeded nodes.

Failure indicators are characteristics of internal states and behavior of a system which indicate potential failures. However, previous studies mostly focused on extracting failure indicators from network and hardware outside of a software system or operating system level, neglected the runtime dynamics on application level. Besides, most of these studies aimed at detecting and predicting performance-related failures. As a major category of software failures, content failures are often omitted. This paper proposes an experiment-based approach to extract interaction-related failure indicators on application level for content failures, composed of abnormal execution time of modules and abnormal interaction times between modules. Firstly, an experiment-based failure data generation method is proposed due to a lack of real-world failure data which can reflect the runtime states and behavior of a software system. Then a machine learning method is selected and applied on the failure dataset to construct classifiers for normal data and failure data, from which failure indicators are extracted. Finally, three open-source software were selected to show the validity of our extracting method and the effectiveness of the extracted failure indicators. Interaction-related failure indicators extracted by the proposed approach can be used for runtime failure detection and prediction of content failures, thus improving runtime dependability of complex software-intensive systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8539208/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW),15-18 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

Indeed, care providers need to access the vital information and sometimes the processed data in order to take timely the adequate decision. However, many issues arise in the data processing regarding real-time aspect, computational complexity and patient mobility. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) engages promising technologies such as the fog and the cloud computing as well as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to address the aforementioned issues. Fog computing enables data preprocessing in proximity of medical users, exploiting patients mobile phones or personal digital assistant (PDA) or small-scale distributed servers. In this paper, we pinpoint the important role of the FL-based system within Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to combat COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we first introduce the architecture highlighting the fog layer within the smart healthcare system. We then discuss the preprocesing tasks that could be implemented at the fog layer with a particular focus on ML and DL tasks. After that, an investigation related to the FL against several COVID-19 contexts is provided. Finally, this paper explores open issues and future directions regarding the FL potentialities in pandemic situation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9473590/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops),14-23 June 2021,ieeexplore

People nowadays are more concerned with their diets than ever before. With the advancement of science, it is now viable to construct a unique food identification system for keeping track of day to day calorie intake. However, building this kind of system creates several complications on constructing and implementing the model. In our paper, we have developed a new neural network based model which will predict the food items from a given image and show us the estimated calorie of the detected food items. In order to achieve our goal, we have prepared a dataset of around 23000 images for 23 different food categories. For this, we have built a system which can detect multiple foods by training CNN with features extracted by Inception V3. We have achieved 89.48% accuracy for this model and we deployed our system on a webpage.

10.1109/RWEEK.2018.8473535,Framework for Data Driven Health Monitoring of Cyber-Physical Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Modern infrastructure is heavily reliant on systems with interconnected computational and physical resources, named Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Hence, building resilient CPSs is a prime need and continuous monitoring of the CPS operational health is essential for improving resilience. This paper presents a framework for calculating and monitoring of health in CPSs using data driven techniques. The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS. The framework consists of four components: 1) Data acquisition and feature extraction, 2) state identification and real time state estimation, 3) cyber-physical health calculation and 4) operator warning generation. Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller. The feature extraction method and the use of unsupervised learning algorithms are discussed. Experimental results are presented for the first two phases and the results showed that the data reflected different operating states and visualization techniques can be used to extract the relationships in data features.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8473535/,2018 Resilience Week (RWS),20-23 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

The goal of depression detection is to improve diagnostic accuracy and availability, leading to faster intervention. The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust depression detection model. To this end, there are two challenges to overcome: 1) Multi-modal (audio, image, text, etc.) information must be jointly considered to make accurate inferences. 2) Existing deep learning-based work suffers from multi-modal data sufficiency problem. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention model embedded with multi-modal knowledge for depression detection. This approach learns not only reasonable embeddings for nodes in the knowledge graph, but also exploits medical knowledge to improve the performance of classification and prediction with the knowledge attention mechanism. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly improves the classification and prediction performance compared with other major state-of-the-art approaches, with guaranteed the robustness with each modality of multi-modal data.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162311/,2020 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),29 June-1 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/DSN.2014.44,Hard Drive Failure Prediction Using Classification and Regression Trees,IEEE,Conferences,"Some statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed to build hard drive prediction models based on the SMART attributes, and have achieved good prediction performance. However, these models were not evaluated in the way as they are used in real-world data centers. Moreover, the hard drives deteriorate gradually, but these models can not describe this gradual change precisely. This paper proposes new hard drive failure prediction models based on Classification and Regression Trees, which perform better in prediction performance as well as stability and interpretability compared with the state-of the-art model, the Back propagation artificial neural network model. Experiments demonstrate that the Classification Tree (CT) model predicts over 95% of failures at a false alarm rate (FAR) under 0.1% on a real-world dataset containing 25,792 drives. Aiming at the practical application of prediction models, we test them with different drive families, with fewer number of drives, and with different model updating strategies. The CT model still shows steady and good performance. We propose a health degree model based on Regression Tree (RT) as well, which can give the drive a health assessment rather than a simple classification result. Therefore, the approach can deal with warnings raised by the prediction model in order of their health degrees. We implement a reliability model for RAID-6 systems with proactive fault tolerance and show that our CT model can significantly improve the reliability and/or reduce construction and maintenance cost of large-scale storage systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6903596/,2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks,23-26 June 2014,ieeexplore
10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

10.1109/AERO.2005.1559665,Health monitoring: new techniques based on vibrations measurements and identification algorithms,IEEE,Conferences,"Purpose of the paper is to present an innovative application inside the nondestructive testing field based on vibrations measurements, developed, at the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" (Italy), by the authors during the last three years, and already tested for analysing damages of many structural elements. The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system. These techniques promise to bring a step forward for the implementation of an automatic ""health monitoring"" system which will be able to identify a structural damage in real time, improving the safety and reducing maintenance costs",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1559665/,2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference,5-12 March 2005,ieeexplore

However, the usual presence of several hundreds of similarly looking, but completely different types of blister packages, in a crowded dispensing station makes it prone to human error, posing serious safety and health concerns for a patients life. In this work, we propose a highlighted deep learning (HDL) based approach for accurate identification of blister packages. HDL allows smart manipulation on raw data in order to better segment the identified targets and to expose inherent descriptive features, thus facilitating an accurate deep learning based classification process. Specifically, HDL uses automatic detection and then segments and processes the raw blister pack images irrespective of position, lighting variations, etc., making them suitable for CNN to classify the correct blister pack types. A ResNet CNN classifier has been trained using the processed images, and the resultant CNN model is finally deployed for classification. We have conducted an extensive experiment at the adult lozenge dispensing station of MacKay Memorial Hospital. The database that will be released along with this paper, consists of 272 types of blister packages, with 65 images belonging to each type for training and additional 7 images for validation.

As per all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) it is advisable to restrict number of visitors inside these enclosed spaces which are most likely to be weather controlled. Automatic safety compliance thus becomes imperative in such situations. Even though absolute compliance and alert signalling will require scrutiny and cross-checking at several levels, a beginning towards automation of compliance monitoring seems mandatory in the neo-normal era. Hence In this project we have designed a low cost rapidly implementable design to monitor the number of visitors inside the self-contained hall. The system will give signal once the maximum permissible visitor population is reached at a given time. Monitoring the optimal population and the density and enforcing visitor to wear mask even within the space manually is tantamount to imposing health hazards to the person who will physically have to monitor and it may as well render the visitors vulnerable. Here we have used Artificial Intelligence based model person detection and tracking. Real time tracking with accuracy is still an important area in computer vision. There are some commercial solution available for the problem but all of them either implemented considering ideal situation or need huge cost and infrastructure. But as a part of museums community we are passing through a financial crises as due to pandemic we closed for visitors. Hence neither we can afford costly system nor a system designed with ideal condition. This motivates us to develop a new system according to our criteria.

Human trait analysis and identification is a field of research that needs a strong implementation for machine learning. Human trait analysis provides a tool with which human identification factors can be verified. Currently, detail aspects of human behavior are digitally and continuously logged in Big Data based platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This continuous flow of high-volume data requires sophisticated data analysis to examine huge amounts of behavioral evidence so that human traits can be modeled. This paper proposes an innovative technique for human trait analysis that fits the needs for user's identity verification. The pioneering work of this technique is in the distinction of the normal and abnormal actions of the users, where the focus is given to these abnormal actions to establish security potential profiles. The data analysis and prediction of the proposed technique is based on the concept of machine learning and uses several models based on four techniques; K-means, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Auto-Encoder Neural Network, and Gaussian Distribution. Experiments have been carried out in four main phases: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions.

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

10.1109/ICIT.2015.7125235,Improving accuracy of long-term prognostics of PEMFC stack to estimate remaining useful life,IEEE,Conferences,"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel cells (PEMFC) are energy systems that facilitate electrochemical reactions to create electrical energy from chemical energy of hydrogen. PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of long-term prognostics. The SW-ELM is used for ensemble modeling due to its enhanced applicability for real applications as compared to conventional data-driven algorithms. The proposed prognostics model is validated on run-to-failure data of PEMFC stack, which had the life span of 1750 hours. The results confirm capability of the prognostics model to achieve accurate RUL estimates.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7125235/,2015 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT),17-19 March 2015,ieeexplore
10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2010.8851,Improving activity classification for health applications on mobile devices using active and semi-supervised learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile phones' increasing ubiquity has created many opportunities for personal context sensing. Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction. Thus, democratic co-learning would be the best choice for most applications, since it would significantly increase the accuracy for initial classifiers that performed poorly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5482296/,2010 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,22-25 March 2010,ieeexplore

However, today's digital work environments are often cumbersome and hard to use, and contribute to stress and ill-health with subsequent cost to the individual, to their employers and to society. Our long-term aim is to facilitate the development of IT systems that provide a healthy digital work environment by including a human factors and ergonomics (HFE) perspective in the requirements engineering (RE) process. IT systems can then be better adapted to professional users, rather than forcing them to adapt work processes to the tools provided. As a first step, we performed an exploratory case study of a recently implemented IT system at a major Nordic bank to identify relevant aspects of HFE to consider within RE. The study consisted of a literature review, observations and interviews. We present eight factors covering user support such as documentation and training, and system characteristics such as understandability, ease of learning, ease of remembering, user satisfaction, system interplay and work-process interplay.

The reason for this is the physical, mental and spiritual benefits that could be obtained by practicing yoga. Many are following this trend and practicing yoga without the training of an expert practitioner. However, following yoga in an improper way or without a proper guidance will lead to bad health issues such as strokes, nerve damage etc. So, following proper yoga postures is an important factor to be considered. In this proposed system, the system is able to identify poses performed by the user and also guide the user visually. This process is required to be completed in real-time in order to be more interactive with the user. In this paper, the yoga posture detection was done in a vision-based approach. The Infinity Yoga Tutor application is able to capture user movements using the mobile camera, which is then streamed at a resolution of 1280 × 720 at 30 frames per second to the detection system.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in occupational safety in the construction industry. However, all the current methods using conventional machine learning with stationary cameras suffer from some severe limitations, perceptual aliasing (e.g., different places/objects can appear identical), occlusion (e.g., place/object appearance changes between visits), seasonal / illumination changes, significant viewpoint changes, etc. This paper proposes a perception module using end-to-end deep-learning and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for an effective and efficient object recognition and navigation using a differential-drive mobile robot. Various deep-learning frameworks and visual navigation strategies with evaluation metrics are implemented and validated for the selection of the best model. The deep-learning model's predictions are evaluated via the metrics (model speed, accuracy, complexity, precision, recall, P-R curve, F1 score). The YOLOv3 shows the best trade-off among all algorithms, 57.9% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 45 frames per second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a right candidate for deploying the neural network on a mobile robot. The evaluation metrics used for the comparison of laser SLAM are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The Google Cartographer SLAM shows the lowest RMSE and acceptable processing time. The experimental results demonstrate that the perception module can meet the requirements of head protection criteria in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for construction. To be more precise, this module can effectively detect construction worker's non-hardhat-use in different construction site conditions and can facilitate improved safety inspection and supervision.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9205772/,2020 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ARIS),19-21 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/SYSTOL.2010.5675940,Intelligent monitoring and fault tolerance in large-scale distributed systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only. Electronic devices are starting to become widely available for monitoring and controlling large-scale distributed systems. These devices may include sensing capabilities for online measurement, actuators for controlling certain variables, microprocessors for processing information and making realtime decisions based on designed algorithms, and telecommunication units for exchanging information with other electronic devices or possibly with human operators. A collection of such devices may be referred to as a networked intelligent agent system. Such systems have the capability to generate a huge volume of spatial-temporal data that can be used for monitoring and control applications of large-scale distributed systems. One of the most important research challenges in the years ahead is the development of information processing methodologies that can be used to extract meaning and knowledge out of the ever-increasing electronic information that will become available. Even more important is the capability to utilize the information that is being produced to design software and devices that operate seamlessly, autonomously and reliably in some intelligent manner. The ultimate objective is to design networked intelligent agent systems that can make appropriate real-time decisions in the management of large-scale distributed systems, while also providing useful high-level information to human operators. One of the most important classes of large-scale distributed systems deals with the reliable operation and intelligent management of critical infrastructures, such as electric power systems, telecommunication networks, water systems, and transportation systems. The design, control and fault monitoring of critical infrastructure systems is becoming increasingly more challenging as their size, complexity and interactions are steadily growing. Moreover, these critical infrastructures are susceptible to natural disasters, frequent failures, as well as malicious attacks. There is a need to develop a common system-theoretic fault diagnostic framework for critical infrastructure systems and to design architectures and algorithms for intelligent monitoring, control and security of such systems. The goal of this presentation is to motivate the need for health monitoring, fault diagnosis and security of critical infrastructure systems and to provide a fault diagnosis methodology for detecting, isolating and accommodating both abrupt and incipient faults in a class of complex nonlinear dynamic systems.

10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431114,Keynote: Explainable-by-design Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"MACHINE and AI justifiably attract the attention and interest not only of the wider scientific community and industry, but also society and policy makers. However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian “black box” society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design. Such systems are able to self-learn lifelong, and continuously improve without the need for complete retraining, can start learning from few training data samples, explore the data space, detect and learn from unseen data patterns, collaborate with humans or other such algorithms seamlessly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9431114/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops),22-26 March 2021,ieeexplore

Extensive time series logging has been implemented to monitor the health of various infrastructure systems. CPU usage of internal services (e.g., large number of machine learning models built by different teams), network traffic between internet service providers and Facebook data centers, video streaming KPI of live broadcasts generated by daily active users, just to name a few. Many methods and tools are available to analyze the logs at single time series level, for instance, time series forecasting and (contextual) anomaly detection. Relatively little is done to address an emerging use case - identifying similar/outlier instances from a large collection of time series. In this poster, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a generic framework to accomplish such needs. We discuss two real-world implementations of the approach: (i) auto-scaling the inference capacity for machine learning (ML) models, and (ii) detect video ingestion quality outliers across Facebook live broadcasts. Specifically, we fill the gaps in existing tools (and/or external, off-the-shelf alternatives) by proposing a method which is interpretable, generalizable and scalable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005642/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

We used a greedy search-and-score procedure known as the K2 algorithm for the estimation of the BN structure. The database consists of a collection of discrete-valued features quantifying presence of morphological changes as prescribed by expert guidelines (updated by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)) and implemented as rule-based programs. We compare the results of structure learning to the expert-guided structure and use decision functions for classification using posterior probabilities. It was found that the BN estimated from structure learning algorithms had comparable classification performance, but fewer edges, leading to more efficient characterization of conditional probability tables (CPD's).

Among many localization algorithms, range-free localization is more preferable because of its cost and implementation efficiency. Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms. Hence, simulation results clearly show that the performance of aforementioned method is better than other pioneer algorithms for such extended networks, and is insusceptible to the ratio of anchor nodes and network density.

Generally speaking, Creativity can only be achieved by brains, which belong to human beings and other intelligent creatures. Machine creativity can rarely be presented. deep learning and reinforcement learning are regarded as having chances to achieve machine creativity and auto-processing. Trained agencies can process complicated real-time issues by being trained in the virtual environment facing with different states. Parameters of the agency are changed all the time until the model is under fitted. However, the creative decision could be achieved to some extent, novel ideas can rarely be output by machines. Therefore, based on the human creativity generation mechanism, loop destroying can break the thinking loop to produce novel ideas.

10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682766,Low-Complexity Compressive Analysis in Sub-Eigenspace for ECG Telemonitoring System,IEEE,Conferences,"Compressive sensing (CS) is attractive in long-term electrocardiography (ECG) telemonitoring to extend life-time for resource-limited wireless wearable sensors. Moreover, health monitoring has emphasized the need for edge computing to process real-time data without the bandwidth costs. However, the reconstructed analysis (RA) and the compressed learning (CL) frameworks have extremely high memory and computational overhead, cost-prohibitive for online usage at resource-constrained edge device. In this paper, to efficiently analyze the received CS measurements with different levels of compression, we propose a low-complexity framework of Compressive Analysis in Sub-Eigenspace (CA-SE) based on subspace-based representation. The dictionary is used for sifting the sub-eigen information from the CS measurements online, and it is built by eigenspace learning offline. The framework can reduce the memory overhead with a single light-weight machine learning model and multiple small filter matrices, and the computational complexity with sifting by matrix-vector product rather than sparse coding. CA-SE is implemented in ECG-based atrial fibrillation detection. The memory overhead of CA-SE is 13 and 39 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively, and the computational complexity of CA-SE is 42 and 10 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682766/,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",12-17 May 2019,ieeexplore

Knowing the health of the printer or the print job helps quantify print job performance, as well as build system alerts to take reactive actions. Intending to run the model dynamically while the machine is printing, time-series based deep learning models like LSTM are most suitable. This paper presents a machine learning based anomaly detection approach to discover patterns in sensors' measurements in the streaming mode in MultiJet Fusion 3d printer developed at HP Inc.

Most of the hospital in Bangladesh lack serving proper health service due to unavailability of appropriate, easy and scalable smart systems. The aim of this project is to build an adequate system for hospitals to serve critical patients with a real-time feedback method. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture, associated terminology and a classificatory model for observing critical patient's health condition with machine learning and IBM cloud computing as Platform as a service (PaaS). Machine Learning (ML) based health prediction of the patients is the key concept of this research. IBM Cloud, IBM Watson studio is the platform for this research to store and maintain our data and ml models. For our ml models, we have chosen the following Base Predictors: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier. For improving the accuracy of the model, the bagging method of ensemble learning has been used. The following algorithms are used for ensemble learning: Bagging Random Forest, Bagging Extra Trees, Bagging KNeighbors, Bagging SVC, and Bagging Ridge. We have developed a mobile application named “Critical Patient Management System - CPMS” for real-time data and information view. The system architecture is designed in such a way that the ml models can train and deploy in a real-time interval by retrieving the data from IBM Cloud and the cloud information can also be accessed through CPMS in a requested time interval. To help the doctors, the ml models will predict the condition of a patient.

The running status of radars are consecutively recorded in time series to monitor the status of different channels. However, due to the large sum of data, the status data is not rigorously used to diagnose possible radar faults. Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data. Based on the assumption that anomaly deviates from normal data, the time periods with large prediction error can be recognized as faults.

PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment. We have applied PerfAnalyzer on five simple stress scenarios - CPU, memory, I/O, disk, and network, and two real system - Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 and IIS 7.0 Web Server, with promising results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5431755/,2009 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,16-20 Nov. 2009,ieeexplore

One aspect of player immersion is the level of challenge the game presents to the player. To avoid a mismatch between a player's skill and the challenge of a game, which can result from traditional manual difficulty selection mechanisms (e.g. easy, medium, hard), Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) has previously been proposed as a means of automatically detecting a player's skill and adjusting the level of challenge the game presents accordingly. This work contributes to the field of DDA by proposing a novel approach to artificially intelligent agents for opponent control. Specifically, we propose four new DDA Artificially Intelligent (AI) agents: Reactive Outcome Sensitive Action Selection (Reactive OSAS), Proactive OSAS, and their ""True"" variants. These agents provide the player with an level of difficulty tailored to their skill in real-time by altering the action selection policy and the heuristic playout evaluation of Monte Carlo Tree Search. The DDA AI agents are tested within the FightingICE engine, which has been used in the past as an environment for AI agent competitions. The results of the experiments against other AI agents and human players show that these novel DDA AI agents can adjust the level of difficulty in real-time, by targeting a zero health difference as the outcome of the fighting game. This work also demonstrates the trade-off existing between targeting the outcome exactly (Reactive OSAS) and introducing proactive behaviour (i.e., the DDA AI agent fights even if the health difference is zero) to increase the agents believability (Proactive OSAS).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8080415/,2017 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG),22-25 Aug. 2017,ieeexplore

These advanced technologies bring about numerous benefits and has begun to play a major role in daily lives, particularly data mining applied in precision agriculture to discover knowledge. Also in agro-industrial production chain, the combination of wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries is outstanding. Mobile IoT such as narrow-band-IoT (NB-IoT) and the long-term evolution (LTE) for machines (LTE-M) are significant innovations of this accelerating development of IoT technologies. In the era of ubiquitous communication where everything is connected to the internet, NB-IoT systems are expected to offer better quality-of-services (QoS) to end users than the traditional IoT paradigm. However, offering better QoS satisfaction to end users will become a great challenge due to the bottleneck caused by the dual problem of increasing IoT use cases and the shortage of wireless spectrum resources. Whilst discussing the recent innovative solutions of NB-IoT resource allocation, significant challenges and open issues related to the real-time implementation of NBIoT are identified and discussed. Therefore, this paper gives a general overview of the resource allocation solutions in this NB-IoT innovation and further suggests and motivates for the intelligentization of future resource allocation solutions (i.e., the use of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9179427/,"2020 International Conference on Electrical, Communication, and Computer Engineering (ICECCE)",12-13 June 2020,ieeexplore

Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the compute-intensive feature extraction stage done right at the output of the camera to extract and transfer only action feature in multi-camera network setting and hence reduce network bandwidth requirement. In this work, we first evaluate the possibility to perform feature extraction under reduced precision fixed-point arithmetic to ease hardware resource requirements. We compared the Histogram of Oriented Gradient in 3D (HOG3D) feature extraction with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods and shown the later to be 75× slower than the former. Our experiment shows that by re-training the classifier with reduced data precision, the classification performs as well as the original double-precision floating-point. Based on this result, we implement an FPGA-based HAR feature extraction for near camera processing using fixed-point data representation and arithmetic. This implementation, using a single Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA, achieves about 70× speedup over multicore CPU.

Nowadays, there are several types of blood pressure meter available manufactured from various companies. In order to meet the demand on telemedicine and technology advancement, a new form of blood pressure meter is desirable. This prototype of blood pressure meter is interfaced with a personal computer (PC) which able to simulate the measurement process in real time. The proposed system is divided by two parts which are hardware and software. Hardware section includes pressure sensor, microcontroller, bulb, cuff and conditioning circuits.

Furthermore, these results will be presented and simulated on the software. MP Lab software packages is used to program the microcontroller. The user interface was developed by using Visual Basic 6.0 language, which highlights the user friendly attributes. Moreover, the simulated waveform will evaluate the blood pressure and gives the blood pressure value. This application shows significant improvement on the overall performance and gives reliable results. The average percentage difference for the systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the OMRON BP meter and proposed e-BPMS are ± 0.95% and ± 1.32% respectively, which is very small and still in the acceptable range.

However, this poses a major challenge for cloud IaaS providers who cannot control the software programs that users develop, install or download on their rented VMs. Those programs may not be well developed with various bugs or even downloaded/installed together with virus, which often make damages to the VMs or infect the cloud platform. To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform.

However, expressions of parts often have a wide range of variations, spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. Normalization of such terms is crucial for many applications. Part names post a major challenge also because they tend to be in the form of multi-word terms. In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method UNAMER (Unification and Normalization Analysis, Misspelling Evaluation and Recognition). It is a general method for identifying term variants, including multi-word term variants, and normalizing them under a canonical name. UNAMER does not rely on a predefined set of canonical terms, which is often hard to obtain. Given a term, UNAMER first identifies candidate variants by exploiting contextual information. It then uses a supervised machine learning model, trained using easy-to-generate examples, that leverages both contextual and lexical features to predict actual variants from the candidates. UNAMER further extends its capability to normalize multi-word parts, such as part names like `lt pnl', `letf pnl' and `lft panal' for `left panel' using a specialized linguistically motivated term alignment approach. UNAMER has been deployed in practical applications to normalize part names in the aerospace domain.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

Additionally, various voltage ratios from the line-to-line voltage are computed. In fact, line-to-line voltage is independent of the nature of load and hence, it is considered as the analysing signal. The voltage ratios together with the calculated energies are considered as the important features for the ANN training for short-switch faults. The whole scheme is implemented by simulation in Matlab/ Simulink. The simulation results show that the scheme successfully identifies the short switch fault for any switch health conditions.

However, most existing approaches do not consider capturing and utilizing this information. ii) Conventional recurrent neural networks cannot store historical interdependent information between heterogeneous features and take advantage of it. To address these challenges, We propose a novel attention mechanism named Cross Attention (CA) that can capture the interdependence between two sequences.

10.1109/SMARTCOMP50058.2020.00027,Quantitative Analysis of Deep Leaf: a Plant Disease Detector on the Smart Edge,IEEE,Conferences,"Diagnosis of plant health conditions is gaining significant attention in smart agriculture. Timely recognition of early symptoms of a disease can help avoid the spread of epidemics on the plantations. In this regard, most of the existing solutions use some AI techniques on smart edge devices (IoTs or intelligent Cyber Physical Systems), typically equipped with a hardware like sensors and actuators. However, the resource constraints on such devices like energy (power), memory and computation capability, make the execution of complex operations and AI algorithms (neural network models) for disease detection quite challenging. To this end, compression and quantization techniques offer viable solutions to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks while maximizing performance on the constrained devices. In this paper, we realized a real intelligent CPS on top of which we implemented an AI application, called Deep Leaf running on a microcontroller of the STM32 family, to detect coffee plant diseases with the help of a Quantized Convolutional Neural Network (Q-CNN) model. We present a quantitative analysis of Deep Leaf by comparing five different deep learning models: a 32-bit floating point model, a compressed model, and three different types of quantized models exhibiting differences in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, average inference time, and energy consumption. Experimental results show that the proposed Deep Leaf detector is able to correctly classify the plant health condition with an accuracy of 96%, thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach on a Smart Edge platform.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239642/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),14-17 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

Therefore, a lightweight and ready-to-go approach that is able to detect anomalies in real-time is highly sought-after. Such an approach could be easily and immediately applied to perform time series anomaly detection on any commodity machine. The approach could provide timely anomaly alerts and by that enable appropriate countermeasures to be undertaken as early as possible. With these goals in mind, this paper introduces ReRe, which is a Real-time Ready-to-go proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for streaming time series. ReRe employs two lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict and jointly determine whether or not an upcoming data point is anomalous based on short-term historical data points and two long-term self-adaptive thresholds.

Though well trained clinicians, medical and psychological treatments are available for depression treatment, persons or families are reluctant to speak out/reach doctors about this disorder for various social reasons. Diagnosis of depression disorder includes numerous interviews with patient and family, clinical analysis, questionnaires which is time consuming and also demands well trained clinicians. In the present era of Machine learning, automation of depression detection is not complicated and can easily be deployed. However, the automation should use fewer resources, provide accurate results with more reachability. In this paper, acoustic features are used to train a classification model to categorize a human as Depressed or not-Depressed. DIAC-WOZ database available with AVEC2016 challenge is considered for training the classifiers. Prosodic, Spectral and Voice control features are extracted using the COVAREP toolbox and are feature fused.

In this paper we report on our efforts to develop a real-time, real-world pain detection system from human facial expressions. Although many studies addressed this challenge, most of them use the same dataset for training and testing. There is no cross-check with other datasets or implementation in real-time to check performance on new data. This is problematic, as evidenced in this paper, because the classifiers overtrain on dataset-specific features. This limits realtime, real-world usage. In this paper, we investigate different methods of real-time pain detection. The training data uses a combination of pain and emotion datasets, unlike other papers. The best model shows an accuracy of 88.4% on a dataset including pain and 7 non-pain emotional expressions. Results suggest that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are not the best methods in some cases as they easily overtrain if the dataset is biased.

This paper proposed a method based on a tri-axial gyroscope for fall events recognition. A tri-axial gyroscope is placed at the user's waist to collect tri-axial angular velocity information. In order to facilitate data processing and extract features, real-time data are divided into a set of consecutive and partially overlapping windows. Three time-domain features that reflect the differences between the falls and other movements in our daily lives are extracted from these consecutive data windows. Then, each of these windows is classified as representing either a fall or a non-fall event by using a trained machine learning classifier. Decision Tree is chosen as the classifier because of its low algorithm complexity and easy implementation on embedded systems. Experimental results have shown that our proposed method can effectively differentiate the fall events from other human daily activities in spite of their high similarity in some cases, with the Accuracy of 99.52%, Precision of 0.993, Recall of 0.995 and F-measure of 0.994.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8361365/,"2018 IEEE 15th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)",27-29 March 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367333,Recommending ticket resolution using feature adaptation,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, IT Service Providers have been rapidly introducing automation to their service delivery model. Driven by market pressure to reduce cost and maintain quality of services, they are looking for technologies that will allow rapid progress towards attainment of truly automated service delivery. Software monitoring systems are designed to actively collect and signal event occurrences and, when necessary, automatically generate incident tickets. Repeating events generate similar tickets, which in turn have a vast number of repeated problem resolutions likely to be found in earlier tickets. In our work, we develop techniques to recommend an appropriate resolution for incoming events by making use of similarities between the events and historical resolutions of similar events. The traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm has been first applied to recommend resolutions for incoming tickets. Massive heterogeneous applications as well as various monitoring software are running on clients' servers to accomplish required tasks and to monitor system health via different metrics. It leads to generation of correlated tickets that have different symptom descriptions but similar resolutions. Furthermore, change of servers' environments can also induce similar situations in which ticket descriptions differ before and after change but could have similar resolutions. These correlated tickets cause performance degradation in ticket resolution recommendation. Therefore, we propose using SCL (structural corresponding learning) based feature adaptation to uncover feature mapping in different time intervals. Moreover, to put more insights into the periodic regularities existing in our ticket datasets, we apply our algorithm on tickets grouped by different time interval granularities. Extensive empirical evaluations on real-world ticket data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7367333/,2015 11th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM),9-13 Nov. 2015,ieeexplore

The respiratory modulations present in simple photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been useful to derive RR using signal processing, waveform fiducial markers, and hand-crafted rules. An end- to-end deep learning approach based on residual network (ResNet) architecture is proposed to estimate RR using PPG. This approach takes time-series PPG data as input, learns the rules through the training process that involved an additional synthetic PPG dataset generated to overcome the insufficient data problem of deep learning, and provides RR estimation as outputs. The inclusion of a synthetic dataset for training improved the performance of the deep learning model by 34%. The final mean absolute error performance of the deep learning approach for RR estimation was 2.5±0.6 brpm using 5-fold cross-validation in two widely used public PPG datasets (n=95) with reliable RR references.

In their homes, robotic agents shall enable people to stay independent, even if they have disabilities that require physical help in their daily life - a pressing need for our aging societies. A key requirement for such robotic agents is that they are safety-aware, that is, that they know when actions may hurt or threaten humans and actively refrain from performing them. Safe robot control systems are a current research focus in control theory. The control system designs, however, are a bit paranoid: programmers build “software fences” around people, effectively preventing physical interactions. To physically interact in a competent manner robotic agents have to reason about the task context, the human, and her intentions. In this paper, we propose to extend cognition-enabled robot control by introducing humans, physical interaction events, and safe movements as first class objects into the plan language.

The inherent natural variation in performing an activity increases while repeating the same activity for an older adult, let alone the variation introduced when another older adult performs the same activity. Moreover, the challenges in acquiring the labeled data while preserving the privacy, availability of annotators with domain knowledge, aversion towards cameras even for a minimal amount of time for ground truth data collection, and psychological and mental health status make AR for older adults challenging. In this paper, we postulate a self-taught learning-based approach that helps recognize activities with variations that are not being directly seen during the training phase. We hypothesize that the features extracted using deep architectures from unlabeled data instances can learn general underlying representations of activities efficiently and help improve activity classification in a supervised setting, although the data instances in labeled data do not follow the generative distribution of that of unlabeled data. We posit real data from a retirement community center using our in-house SenseBox infrastructure and survey-based assessments concurrently done by a clinical evaluator to study the relationship between activities and functional/behavioral health of older adults.

10.1109/ESCI50559.2021.9397033,Selection of Tree Based Ensemble Classifier for Detecting Network Attacks in IoT,IEEE,Conferences,"Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging architecture in the field of Information and communication technology. Nowadays IoT is being used in many fields of Information Technology and general life like in the fields of health, agriculture, weather etc. Due to its advantages it is getting popularity and hence attracting the hackers and attackers for novel attacks. To run the IoT related services interruption free and to save the private data of the network users, the installation of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential step. The efficiency of an IDS depends upon the efficiency of classifier being used inside the IDS for detecting the attacks or intrusion. To become an IDS an efficient IDS, it should not only be efficient in major performance measuring parameters but also it should be as quick as possible to detect the intrusion in the network so that it can detect the attack in real time. To achieve this objective many classifiers have been used for the implementation of IDS. In this work, tree-based ensemble methods are used for checking their performance to identify network attacks in IoT architecture. For this purpose, BoT-IoT dataset, a well-known and publicly available dataset is used for the said purpose. The tree-based ensemble methods used in this work for identifying the attacks in the IoT network are Random Forest, LGBM, Extra Tree, Gradient Boost, XGBoost. The performance measuring metrics calculated to measure the performance of a method are Accuracy, F1, Recall and Precision. Also, the detection time of all the methods have been calculated. It is found that LGBM is outperforming all other methods in all the metrics when combining through detection time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9397033/,2021 International Conference on Emerging Smart Computing and Informatics (ESCI),5-7 March 2021,ieeexplore

Unlike traditional Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), self-aware SoCs must deploy an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing infrastructure that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the systems behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). Self-aware SoCs require a combination of ubiquitous sensing and actuation, health-monitoring, and self-learning to enable the SoCs adaptation over time and space.

10.1109/VPPC.2012.6422670,Self-learning state-of-available-power prediction for lithium-ion batteries in electrical vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper describes an overall system for state-of-available-power (SoAP) prediction for a lithium-ion battery pack. The essential part of this method is based on an adaptive network architecture which utilizes both fuzzy model (FIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). While battery aging proceeds, the system is capable of delivering accurate power prediction for the typical temperature range. Due to design property of ANN, the network parameters are adapted on-line to the current states (state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature). SoC is required as an input parameter to SoAP module and high accuracy is crucial for a reliable self-learning capability. Therefore, a reasonable way to determine the battery state variables is proposed applying a combination of several partly different algorithms. Among others SoC boundary estimation methods, robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for recalibration of amp hour counters was implemented. ANFIS then achieves the SoAP estimation by means of time forward voltage prognosis (TFVP) before a power pulse. The tradeoff between computational cost of batch-learning and accuracy during on-line adaptation was optimized resulting in a real-time system. The verification was performed on a software-in-the-loop test bench setup using a 53 Ah lithium-ion cell.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6422670/,2012 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference,9-12 Oct. 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/DS-RT.2007.38,Semantic Web Service Architecture for Simulation Model Reuse,IEEE,Conferences,"COTS simulation packages (CSPs) have proved popular in an industrial setting with a number of software vendors. In contrast, options for re-using existing models seem more limited. Re-use of simulation component models by collaborating organizations is restricted by the same semantic issues however that restrict the inter-organization use of web services. The current representations of web components are predominantly syntactic in nature lacking the fundamental semantic underpinning required to support discovery on the emerging semantic web. Semantic models, in the form of ontology, utilized by web service discovery and deployment architecture provide one approach to support simulation model reuse. Semantic interoperation is achieved through the use of simulation component ontology to identify required components at varying levels of granularity (including both abstract and specialized components). Selected simulation components are loaded into a CSP, modified according to the requirements of the new model and executed. The paper presents the development of ontology, connector software and web service discovery architecture in order to understand how such ontology are created, maintained and subsequently used for simulation model reuse. The ontology is extracted from health service simulation - comprising hospitals and the National Blood Service. The ontology engineering framework and discovery architecture provide a novel approach to inter- organization simulation, uncovering domain semantics and adopting a less intrusive interface between participants.

10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172454,Semi-Supervised Machine Learning for Spacecraft Anomaly Detection &amp; Diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper describes Anomaly Detection via Topological-feature Map (ADTM), a data-driven approach to Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) for monitoring the health of spacecraft and space habitats. Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults. We include an analysis and discussion of ADTM's performance on several of these fault cases. We conclude with a brief discussion of future work, which contains investigation of a hierarchical SOM-architecture as well as a Case-Based Reasoning module for further assisting astronauts in diagnosis and remediation activities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172454/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore

Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system.

10.1109/INDIANCC.2016.7441102,Sensor health monitoring using simple data driven approaches,IEEE,Conferences,"Present day high end vehicles contain as many as 100 microprocessors and have more than 100 million lines of code [3]. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7441102/,2016 Indian Control Conference (ICC),4-6 Jan. 2016,ieeexplore

Smart homes for the elderly have the potential to offer unobtrusive health and wellness monitoring. The aim is to provide a safe, independent living environment which can identify and predict problems by monitoring the activities of daily living (ADLs) of the inhabitants. For this, a system able to handle continuous streams of data is required. Such a system can extract the information by using appropriate classification and learning algorithms and thus allow the remote monitoring of health and wellbeing at a high level. The implementation requires: the use of appropriate sensing technologies, identification of ADLs, data pre-processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. This is challenging due to individual differences: such a system must be able to personalize individual needs. Our contribution was the design and implementation of a platform to smartly monitor health condition of elderly using sensor data from a smart home, through an interactive user interface which is user-friendly and multi-platform.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models. Experimental results show that SensoryGANs models have the capability of capturing the implicit distribution of real sensor data of human activity, and then the synthetic sensor data generated by SensoryGANs models Have a potential for improving human activity recognition.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489106/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

Fifteen volunteers performed a standardized set of movements which were developed by mimicking the scenarios in the FARSEEING Fall Repository, including 10 falling activities and 10 non-falling activities, resulting in a dataset with 900 samples. Supervised Learning is implemented by using two training sets: (1) 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities and (2) 10 real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository added to the 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities. Testing is done by using the remaining 20% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities, remaining five real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository, and actual testing in a simulated environment. Results show that the model with the training data using simulated falls only (Model 1) detected a 10% TPR while the model with real-world fall added (Model 2) detected a 100% TPR when tested using unseen data.

In Pakistan its significance is more than ordinary due to the agrarian nature of the economy. Owing to increasing trend in urbanization and industrialization, the quality of water is continuously declining. For this purpose, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) based water quality system capable of measuring the quality of water in near real time. The proposed solution is based on World Health Organization (WHO) defined water quality metrics. For this purpose, a real time embedded prototype has been developed to record the water quality parameters from the water samples collected from various sources across the study area. The hardware solution sends data to cloud for real time storage and processing. The processed data can be remotely monitored and water flow can be controlled using our developed software solution comprising of mobile app and a dashboard. In addition to water quality monitoring and control system, the predictive analysis of the collected data has been performed. For training purposes a dataset has been obtained from Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR). Machine learning algorithms have been applied for classification of water quality and the experimental results indicate that deep neural network outperforms all other algorithms with an accuracy of 93%.

10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983290,Survival Prediction from Longitudinal Health Insurance Data using Graph Pattern Mining,IEEE,Conferences,"Survival prediction based on health insurance data is a promising research direction, since through health insurance data, we may be able to uncover the implicit information reflecting the health status of patients. Deep learning models, especially the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are powerful tools. However, at this stage, it is often difficult to explain the semantics of the features and evolution laws learned by RNNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a survival prediction model based on graph pattern mining. First, each patient's health insurance data are built as a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN). Then, frequent patterns are mined from these HINs and each frequent pattern is regarded as a feature, called “pattern feature”. At last, the predictive survival time is given by an improved random forest, which is able to take into account the censored data. We conducted experiments on a real health insurance data set. The experimental results show that the model has better predictive ability than the traditional survival prediction models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8983290/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),18-21 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/TAAI.2011.47,System Failure Forewarning Based on Workload Density Cluster Analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Each computer system contains design objectives for long-term usage, so the operator must conduct a continuous and accurate assessment of system performance in order to detect the potential factors that will degrade system performance. Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system. Although it is infeasible for the system to process the largest possible fault events in the deployment of resources, we could apply statistics to characterize the anomalous behaviors to understand the nature of emergencies and to test system service under such scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6120749/,2011 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence,11-13 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore

10.1109/AITest.2019.00011,Test-Driven Anonymization for Artificial Intelligence,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, data published and shared with third parties to develop artificial intelligence (AI) tools and services has significantly increased. When there are regulatory or internal requirements regarding privacy of data, anonymization techniques are used to maintain privacy by transforming the data. The side-effect is that the anonymization may lead to useless data to train and test the AI because it is highly dependent on the quality of the data. To overcome this problem, we propose a test-driven anonymization approach for artificial intelligence tools. The approach tests different anonymization efforts to achieve a trade-off in terms of privacy (non-functional quality) and functional suitability of the artificial intelligence technique (functional quality). The approach has been validated by means of two real-life datasets in the domains of healthcare and health insurance. Each of these datasets is anonymized with several privacy protections and then used to train classification AIs. The results show how we can anonymize the data to achieve an adequate functional suitability in the AI context while maintaining the privacy of the anonymized data as high as possible.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718230/,2019 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),4-9 April 2019,ieeexplore

Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements. The results show that TDA can be successfully applied to anonymize the clinical data of the INEBIR, allowing third parties to transfer without transgressing user privacy and develop useful AI Tools with the anonymized data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176766/,2020 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),3-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

This paper explores one such possibility, a conversational agent, able to guide users through an HIV counseling and testing session. Using commercially available software (http://api.ai), an agent was designed and built according to the Center for Disease Control's guidelines for the provision of HIV counseling and testing in a non-clinical setting. The agent was linked to the Telegram chat client (http://telegram.org) and 10 testers were invited to participate in a simulated HIV counseling interaction. Six testers found that talking to the agent felt natural, and equivalent to chatting to a human. Seven said they would feel comfortable taking a real HIV test with the agent. Key concerns with the current agent were the use of overly formal language, the speed at which the agent responded (too fast) and the agent either misunderstanding or not understanding the tester. Positive sentiment towards the agent included the fact that testers felt like the session was more private and anonymous, and avoided the need for them to visit a public health facility and stand in a long queue to get tested.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8253198/,2017 International Conference on the Frontiers and Advances in Data Science (FADS),23-25 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

Many tools and approaches have been considered to enable the progress toward malaria vision. The use of portable smartphones and machine learning (ML) software is a promising one among them. Recently, many ML models have been proposed for malaria detection. From the interview with health workers in the field, we realized ML model should be continuously improved to provide higher accuracy and/or more capability to cover practical issues found in a real setting such as malaria mosquitoes with drug resistance. In this paper, we propose the mobile application for malaria detection which upgrades ML model on its own without depending on internet connection. Unavailability of internet connection is commonly observed in malaria epidemic countries. We also learned that ML model should be not only accurate but also resource-efficient. This motivated us to set up performance metrics for ML model. Based on the metrics, we chose the optimal ML model of Resnet-50. While most of the prior art ML models were optimized in terms of accuracy only, the optimal model of our choice satisfies both accuracy and resource efficiency. With adopting the model, we architect self-upgrading malaria-detection application and it is validated using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to ensure the application works in the resource-constrained setting as desired.

In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time.

In this paper, aiming to solve all the above problems including (5), we propose a new system by extending our prior work. To realize “real-time” ADL recognition while keeping good recognition accuracy, we developed new power meters with higher sensing frequency and introduced new techniques such as adding new features, selecting the best subset of the features, and selecting the best training dataset used for machine learning.

Although normal operation of battery packs can be simulated in the lab to generate aging data, a variety of other non-operational profiles are typically needed, requiring many hours of testing, often at conditions different than normal operational conditions observed when the battery pack is deployed in its intended application. Moreover, application of prolonged and multiple capacity tests can be detrimental to the health of the battery. In view of these concerns, this article continues a line of research into capacity fade estimation approaches that require less data and time for the data generation process; in particular, an approach using rule based machine learning for Li-ion battery packs is proposed. Using data generated in the laboratory, aging behavior is characterized by measurable features and a supervised learning approach in order to estimate capacity fade using real-time operational data toward the goal of eliminating the need for specific capacity tests.

For Human Activity Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have shown their capability to provide better performance compared to other machine learning methods. However, ANNs suffer from two major limitations. First, ANNs are often trained using supervised learning requiring labelled databases, which are often difficult to build in real applications. Then, those algorithms are usually very expensive in terms of computing power. For that reason, their integration into low-power microcontrollers has been so far only evaluated to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the embedded implementation of different neural networks for human activity recognition. First, supervised learning approaches are presented, followed by an exploratory study of unsupervised learning approaches using Self-Organizing Maps. Finally, some aspects of embedded unsupervised online learning are investigated to improve classification results using subject-specific data over a more general training.

Successful stress management closely depends on the effective monitoring of peoples everyday behaviors. In this paper, we design a workplace behavior monitoring system that collects the ballistocardiographic (BCG) signals using piezoelectric sensors mounted inside the cushions of office chairs. In addition to being able to reflect the body displacement along with the ventricle contraction, the BCG signals also contain multiple sources of interferences, and thus can be used to detect the modes of the body motions. An ensemble machine learning scheme is developed to classify the BCG waveform into several categories, including off-seat, sedate, working and in motion. When an employee is in a sedate position, the BCG samples can be further processed to observe the cardiovascular activities. These temporal classified results can be analyzed to establish the individual employee's office profile. Compared with the recorded baseline, early intervention is made possible when needed. The proposed system has been tested with 12 subjects, and the preliminary results demonstrate its potential application in the real world workplace environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8965717/,"2019 12th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)",19-21 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

Such environments are not feasible without correctly identifying states and activities of the persons receiving the care. They rely on the interaction and processing of data originating from many components and objects in the surrounding. In order to collect the data, various sensors are used to monitor the environment, as well as the person's health parameters. One of the main concerns in AAL is preservation of user's privacy. In this paper we address that by proposing a non-intrusive approach for data collection and identification of daily activity and risks. We describe the wiring of such system based on cheap non-intrusive sensors, deployment in a real environment, the protocols for data fusion and processing, and explain how machine learning could be employed for detecting risks and activities.

The World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2016, reported that 17.9 million deaths that occur worldwide per year are a result of heart disease. In the health care sector, enormous data are being generated on a daily basis, which contains different types of data, and acquiring knowledge from these data is essential. This knowledge can be acquired using various data mining techniques to mine knowledge by designing models from the medical records dataset. We implement a machine learning based system that can detect and predict heart diseases in patients using the medical records of patients. The proposed solution is based on existing techniques like Random Forest Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression, which provides a decision support system for medical professionals to detect and predict heart diseases and heart attacks in humans or individuals using risk factors of heart disease. The dataset used in our model consists of 18 features (risk factors) and 1990 observations after performing preprocessing. It was then split into 80% train sets and 20% test sets. Using real medical records of patients, a series of experiments were conducted to examine the performance and accuracy of the proposed system. The system was implemented in RStudio platform which predicts the risk of heart disease in patients.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility. Results from the network are explainable, enabling human oversight of operational decisions. Real-time implementation enables integration into avionics systems.

An application that lacks a strong implementation for anomaly detection is user trait modeling. User trait models expose up-to-date representation of the user so that changes in their interests, their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and interpreted. The reason behind the lack of adoption in user trait modeling arises from the need for a continuous flow of high-volume data, that is not available in most cases, to achieve high-accuracy detection. This paper provides new insight into the anomaly detection techniques through Big Data utilization. With Big Data characteristics, i.e., volume, variety and velocity, anomaly detection techniques have become more suitable tools for user trait modeling. User traits will be modeled by creating a security user profile for each user. This profile is structured and developed to be a source for a strong real-time user authentication method. An ingenious implementation of three models; k-means, HMM, and auto-encoder neural network has been presented that automatically and accurately build a unique pattern of the users' behavior. The implementation comprises four main steps: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions.

According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance.

Through comparison studies, detail-oriented simulations, and pragmatic field tests, an effective fall prediction method has been developed by authors. The finding is presented in this paper. Three techniques for fall prediction are discussed in this paper. A comparison technique to mimic the traditional stateless fall prediction techniques, along with an algorithm using artificial neural network, was first implemented in authors' previous paper. Then a robotic scheme was developed to simulate human fall by transplanting a proven fall prediction paradigm for humanoid robots with controlled electric drive systems to human subjects. Due to its simulation nature far from the human fall scenarios in reality, the robotic paradigm has obvious limits in real world applications.

10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator.

Typically, systems use controllers or hand gestures to interact with virtual objects. However, these motions are often unnatural and diminish the immersion of the experience. Moreover, these approaches offer limited tactile feedback. There does not currently exist a platform to bring an arbitrary physical object into the virtual world without additional peripherals or the use of expensive motion capture systems. Such a system could be used for immersive experiences within the entertainment industry as well as being applied to VR or AR training experiences, in the fields of health and engineering. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for creating an interactive virtual prop from rigid and non-rigid physical objects. This includes a novel method for tracking the deformations of rigid and non-rigid objects at interactive rates using a single RGBD camera. We scan our physical object and process the point cloud to produce a triangular mesh. A range of possible deformations can be obtained by using a finite element method simulation and these are reduced to a low dimensional basis using principal component analysis. Machine learning approaches, in particular neural networks, have become key tools in computer vision and have been used on a range of tasks. Moreover, there has been an increased trend in training networks on synthetic data. To this end, we use a convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data, to track the movement and potential deformations of an object in unlabelled RGB images from a single RGBD camera.

The use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is currently being investigated for it's ability to provide subsurface images.

As data driven machine learning techniques have proven to work in higly challenging data, our intenetion is to apply such techniques in GPR data processing.

This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets.

10.1109/CCA.2000.897405,Winner take all experts network for sensor validation,IEEE,Conferences,"The validation of sensor measurements has become an integral part of the operation and control of modern industrial equipment. The sensor under a harsh environment must be shown to consistently provide the correct measurements. Analysis of the validation hardware or software should trigger an alarm when the sensor signals deviate appreciably from the correct values. Neural network based models can be used to estimate critical sensor values when neighboring sensor measurements are used as inputs. The discrepancy between the measured and predicted sensor values may then be used as an indicator for sensor health. The proposed winner take all experts (WTAE) network is based on a 'divide and conquer' strategy. It employs a growing fuzzy clustering algorithm to divide a complicated problem into a series of simpler sub-problems and assigns an expert to each of them locally. After the sensor approximation, the outputs from the estimator and the real sensor value are compared both in the time domain and the frequency domain. Three fault indicators are used to provide analytical redundancy to detect the sensor failure. In the decision stage, the intersection of three fuzzy sets accomplishes a decision level fusion, which indicates the confidence level of the sensor health. Two data sets, the Spectra Quest Machinery Fault Simulator data set and the Westland vibration data set, were used in simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed WTAE network. The simulation results show the proposed WTAE is competitive with or even superior to the existing approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/897405/,Proceedings of the 2000.

However, some cheating players gain improper advantages over normal players by using illegal automated plugins which has brought huge harm to game health and player enjoyment. Game industries have been devoting much efforts on cheating detection with multiview data sources and achieved great accuracy improvements by applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, generating explanations for cheating detection from multiple views still remains a challenging task. To respond to the different purposes of explainability in AI models from different audience profiles, we propose the EMGCD, the first explainable multi-view game cheating detection framework driven by explainable AI (XAI). It combines cheating explainers to cheating classifiers from different views to generate individual, local and global explanations which contributes to the evidence generation, reason generation, model debugging and model compression. The EMGCD has been implemented and deployed in multiple game productions in NetEase Games, achieving remarkable and trustworthy performance.

10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378023,Zero-Shot Machine Learning Technique for Classification of Multi-User Big Data Workloads,IEEE,Conferences,"During the last decade machine learning has revolutionized computer science applications. Supervised machine learning algorithms have become especially successful in many industries including health, legal, security, finance, travel, and others. Training supervised learning algorithms, however, is expensive because the real world contains a very large number of different classes that need to be covered by the training set. This is especially true for the highly variable, multi-user workload data produced by the strategically vital big data and cloud software stacks. It is very important, however, to be able to accurately classify these complex workloads in order to enable autonomic management and optimization. Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is an advanced machine learning approach that enables classification of objects without having to explicitly train on examples of those objects. In this paper we present a new ZSL technique intended to reduce the expense of assembling workload training sets for big data analytic workloads. We demonstrate that multi-user big data workloads can be treated as hybrids of simpler, single-user workload classes, and classified accurately without having to explicitly train on example instances of multi-user workloads. Our technique is able to accurately classify both unseen multi-user workloads, and seen single-user workloads using the same classifier. We demonstrate 83% classification accuracy for the unseen multi-user workloads, and 92% classification accuracy for the seen, single-user workload classes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378023/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Remote care-giving technologies (mHealth, Telehealth, Telemedicine) are an extended branch of eHealth initiatives. The concept of health e- Coaching is another promising initiative of eHealth research for real-time personalized lifestyle support. The focus of eHealth initiatives is to deliver high quality, evidence-based, secure, cost- effective, timely care to support people for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. However, the practical implementation of different eHealth initiatives has often been challenging to establish prophesied benefit.

An optimized system for health e-Coaching, management of a huge amount of health data, ensuring data protection are some big challenges to the eHealth researchers. Prediction of human psychology for effective e-Coaching recommendation is another level of difficulty to overcome as human behavior is constantly changing.

Existing approaches for automatic eating detection using wearable sensors often require custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively monitor and detect users' eating episodes by analyzing the chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could achieve 94-95% classification accuracy in lab settings, though the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76% for in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning based classification technique that drastically improved detection accuracy to 77-94% despite the existence of ambient noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Bluetooth headsets to detect eating episodes and to use Deep Learning to significantly increase classification performance in this context.

Two of the main expectations of 5G networks are that they will be able to handle ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streaming and that they will deliver services that meet the requirements of the end user's perceived quality by adopting quality of experience (QoE) aware network management approaches. This paper proposes a 5G-QoE framework to address the QoE modeling for UHD video flows in 5G networks. Particularly, it focuses on providing a QoE prediction model that is both sufficiently accurate and of low enough complexity to be employed as a continuous real-time indicator of the “health” of video application flows at the scale required in future 5G networks. The model has been developed and implemented as part of the EU 5G PPP SELFNET autonomic management framework, where it provides a primary indicator of the likely perceptual quality of UHD video application flows traversing a realistic multi-tenanted 5G mobile edge network testbed. The proposed 5G-QoE framework has been implemented in the 5G testbed, and the high accuracy of QoE prediction has been validated through comparing the predicted QoE values with not only subjective testing results but also empirical measurements in the testbed.

Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries.

In this paper, we propose a scheme to parasitize the data in surrounding Wi-Fi networks whenever temporary disconnection occurs. Specifically, we model data parasitizing as an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the system lifetime without any data loss. Then, we propose an optimal offline algorithm to solve the problem, as well as an online algorithm that allows practical implementations.

The construction of the proposed model includes three steps: First, a nonlinear mathematical model of a turbofan engine is established by adopting the component modeling approach. Then, numerous parameters of the turbofan engine components and their operating data are obtained by simulating various working conditions. Finally, based on the simulated data for the engine under these conditions, the model at the points during the dynamic process is linearized, such that a dynamic real-time linearized model of turbofan engine is obtained.

Cough assessment has been limited so far to subjective measurement tools or uncomfortable (i.e., non-wearable) cough monitors. This limits the potential of real-time cough monitoring to improve respiratory care. Objective: This paper presents a machine hearing system for audio-based robust cough segmentation that can be easily deployed in mobile scenarios. Methods: Cough detection is performed in two steps. First, a short-term spectral feature set is separately computed in five predefined frequency bands: [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), [1, 1.5), [1.5, 2), and [2, 5.5125] kHz. Feature selection and combination are then applied to make the short-term feature set robust enough in different noisy scenarios. Second, high-level data representation is achieved by computing the mean and standard deviation of short-term descriptors in 300 ms long-term frames. Finally, cough detection is carried out using a support vector machine trained with data from different noisy scenarios. The system is evaluated using a patient signal database which emulates three real-life scenarios in terms of noise content. Results: The system achieves 92.71% sensitivity, 88.58% specificity, and 90.69% Area Under Receiver Operating Charcteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Our research outcome paves the way to create a device for cough monitoring in real-life situations.

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2794337,A Narrow-Band Indoor Positioning System by Fusing Time and Received Signal Strength via Ensemble Learning,IEEE,Journals,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm to integrate the physical world into cyber systems by connecting various devices, which sense and control the surrounding objects. For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61 m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259458/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/JBHI.2015.2427511,A Natural Walking Monitor for Pulmonary Patients Using Mobile Phones,IEEE,Journals,"Mobile devices have the potential to continuously monitor health by collecting movement data including walking speed during natural walking. Natural walking is walking without artificial speed constraints present in both treadmill and nurse-assisted walking. Fitness trackers have become popular which record steps taken and distance, typically using a fixed stride length. While useful for everyday purposes, medical monitoring requires precise accuracy and testing on real patients with a scientifically valid measure. Walking speed is closely linked to morbidity in patients and widely used for medical assessment via measured walking. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a standard assessment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Current generation smartphone hardware contains similar sensor chips as in medical devices and popular fitness devices. We developed a middleware software, MoveSense, which runs on standalone smartphones while providing comparable readings to medical accelerometers. We evaluate six machine learning methods to obtain gait speed during natural walking training models to predict natural walking speed and distance during a 6MWT with 28 pulmonary patients and ten subjects without pulmonary condition. We also compare our model's accuracy to popular fitness devices. Our universally trained support vector machine models produce 6MWT distance with 3.23% error during a controlled 6MWT and 11.2% during natural free walking. Furthermore, our model attains 7.9% error when tested on five subjects for distance estimation compared to the 50-400% error seen in fitness devices during natural walking.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7096915/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,July 2015,ieeexplore

Fortunately, these years are also characterized by a marked technological drive which takes the name of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this terrain, robotics is making its way through more and more aspects of everyday life, and robotics-based assistance/rehabilitation is considered one of the most encouraging applications. Providing high-intensity rehabilitation sessions or home assistance through low-cost robotic devices can be indeed an effective solution to democratize services otherwise not accessible to everyone. However, the identification of an intuitive and reliable real-time control system does arise as one of the critical issues to unravel for this technology in order to land in homes or clinics.

Manual weedicide spray through bag-pack is hazardous to human health. Localized autonomous weedicide spray through aerial spraying units can help save water, weedicide chemical and effect less on human health. Such systems require multi-spectral cues to classify crop, weed, and soil surface. Our focus in this paper is on the detection of weeds in the sugar beet crop, using air-borne multispectral camera sensors, which is considered as an alternative crop to sugarcane to obtain sugar in Pakistan. We developed a new framework for weed identification; a patch-based classification approach as appose to semantic segmentation that is more realistic for real-time intelligent aerial spraying systems. Our approach converts 3-class pixel classification problem into a 2-class crop-weed patch classification problem which in turns improves crop and weed classification accuracy. For classification, we developed a new VGG-Beet convolutional neural network (CNN), which is based on generic VGG16 (visual graphics group) CNN model with 11 convolutional layers. For experiments, we captured a sugar beet dataset with 3-channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.2 cm/pixel and a height of 4 meters. For better comparison, we used two publicly available sugar beet crop aerial imagery datasets, captured using a 5-channel multispectral sensor and a 4-Channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance of 1cm and a height of 10 meters. We observed that patch-based method is more robust to different lighting conditions. To produce low cost weed detection system usage of Agrocam sensor is recommended, for higher accuracy Red Edge and Sequoia multispectral sensors with more channels should be deployed.

Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area.

Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller. Our proposed architecture showcases an efficient approach to handle future interruption and faults in power grid using cost-effective and reliable infrastructure that can predict and provide real-time health monitoring indices for the Iraqi grid network with minimal power interruptions.

10.1109/TCBB.2017.2780106,A Sparse Regression Method for Group-Wise Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control,IEEE,Journals,"The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, or SLOPE, is a sparse regression method recently introduced by Bogdan et. al. [1] . It can be used to identify significant predictor variables in a linear model that may have more unknown parameters than observations. When the correlations between predictor variables are small, the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. However, the requirement for nearly uncorrelated predictors is too restrictive for genomic data, as demonstrated in our recent study [2] by an application of SLOPE to realistic simulated DNA sequence data. A possible solution is to divide the predictor variables into nearly uncorrelated groups, and to modify the procedure to select entire groups with an overall significant group effect, rather than individual predictors. Following this motivation, we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genomic data. Our theoretical results show that Group SLOPE controls the group-wise false discovery rate (gFDR), when groups are orthogonal to each other. For use in non-orthogonal settings, we propose two types of Monte Carlo based heuristics, which lead to gFDR control with Group SLOPE in simulations based on real SNP data. As an illustration of the merits of this method, an application of Group SLOPE to a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study results in the identification of some known DNA sequence regions associated with bone health, as well as some new candidate regions.

Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to classify human motions and identify the fall status automatically.

In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own.

However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with these problems. By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40000 users. Compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, the extensive experimental results show that our approach is significantly more effective and efficient. Our approach agent which provides decision support for the approval sender during the medical insurance claim approval process is undergoing trial in mobile healthcare services.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489846/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

However, traditional fault diagnosis methods usually adopt manual feature extraction, which not only costs expensively and depends on prior knowledge. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of automatic fault identification based on the original vibration signals. Recently, existing studies have shown that most of fault diagnoses are implemented by using deep neural network. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performances, there are obvious limitations in real applications, that is, the complexity of deep neural network requires a lot of hardware computing resources. This hinders the development of online fault diagnosis tools. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet, and realizes an end-to-end intelligent fault classification and diagnosis application. We evaluated the proposed method with the rolling bearing dataset from Western Reserve University. The best average precision, recall and F1 score of ten different bearing health conditions are about 96%, 82% and 88%, respectively. In addition, we also compare the accuracy of the rolling bearing fault diagnosis classification model under the standard ReLU and the improved ReLU.

10.1109/TETCI.2019.2910243,An Enhanced Stacked LSTM Method With No Random Initialization for Malware Threat Hunting in Safety and Time-Critical Systems,IEEE,Journals,"Malware detection is an increasingly important operational focus in cyber security, particularly, given the fast pace of such threats (e.g., new malware variants introduced every day). In recent years, there has been increased interest in exploring the use of machine learning techniques in automating and enhancing the effectiveness of malware detection and analysis. In this paper, we present a deep recurrent neural network solution as a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) with a pre-training as a regularization method to avoid random network initialization. In our proposed approach, we use global and short dependencies of the inputs. With pre-training, we avoid random initialization and are able to improve the accuracy and robustness of malware threat hunting. The proposed method speeds up the convergence, in comparison to the stacked LSTM, by reducing the length of malware OpCode or bytecode sequences. Hence, the complexity of our final method is reduced. This leads to better accuracy, higher Mattews Correlation Coefficients (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC) in comparison to a standard LSTM with similar detection time. Our proposed method can be applied in real-time malware threat hunting, particularly, for safety critical systems, such as electronic health or Internet of Battlefield / Military of Things, where poor convergence of the model could lead to catastrophic consequences. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on Windows, Ransomware, Internet of Things (IoT), and Android malware datasets using both static and dynamic analysis. For the IoT malware detection, we also present a comparative summary of the performance on an IoT-specific dataset of our proposed method and the standard stacked LSTM method. More specifically, our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 99.1% in detecting IoT malware samples, with AUC of 0.985 and MCC of 0.95; thus, outperforming standard LSTM-based methods in these key metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9122024/,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results.

The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS.

It includes sophisticated applications such as malpractice detection in the examination, distracted driving, gesture detection, etc., and requires robust and reliable pose estimation techniques. These applications help to map the attention of the user with head pose estimation (HPE) metrics supported by emotion and gaze analysis. This paper solves the problem of attention score estimation with HPE. The proposed method ensures ease of implementation while addressing head pose estimation using 68 facial features. Further, to attain reliability and precision, head pose estimation has been implemented as a regression task. The coordinate pair angle method (CPAM) with deep neural network (DNN) regression and elastic net regression is carried out. The use of DNN ensures precision on low lighting, distorted or occluded images. CPAM methodology leverages facial landmark detection and angular difference to estimate head pose.

Besides, conventional hyperparameters tuning via grid search or manual tuning requires a lot of human intervention and becomes inflexible for users. Two objectives are targeted in this work.

Secondly, to diminish human intervention burdens, we propose an Automatic artificial Neural network with an Augmented Hidden Layer (Auto-NAHL) for the classification of health states. Within the designed network, it is worthy to mention that the novelty of the implemented neural architecture is attributed to the new multiple feature mappings of the inputs, where such configuration allows the hidden layer to learn multiple representations from several random linear mappings and produce a single final efficient representation. Hyperparameters tuning including the network architecture, is fully automated by incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.

However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules.

Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241785/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

With local authority maintained monitoring stations being geographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels, computational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the air quality index, using environmental monitoring data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced with a novel non-linear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input model, especially designed for time series prediction.

According to operating experience data and the type of mining machine, total loss failure rates per machine fleet can reach up to 30%. Vibration analysis techniques are commonly used for condition monitoring and early detection of unforeseen failures to generate predictive maintenance plans for heavy machinery. However, this maintenance strategy is intensively used only for stationary machines and/or mobile machinery in stationary operations. Today, there is a lack of proper solutions to detect and prevent critical failures for non-stationary machinery. This paper shows a cost-effective solution proposal for implementing a vibration sensor network with wireless communication and machine learning data-driven capabilities for condition monitoring of non-stationary heavy machinery in mining operations. During the machine operation, 3-axis accelerations were measured using two sensors deployed across the machine. The machine accelerations (amplitudes and frequencies) are measured in two different frequency spectrums to improve each sensing location's time resolution. Multiple machine learning algorithms use this machine data to assess conditions according to manufacturer recommendations and operational benchmarks Proposed data-driven machine learning models classify the machine condition in states according to the ISO 2372 standards for vibration severity: Good, Acceptable, Unsatisfactory, or Unacceptable. After performing field tests with bulldozers and backhoes from different manufacturers, the machine learning algorithms are able to classify machine health status with an accuracy between 85% - 95%. Moreover, the system allows early detection of “Unacceptable” states between 120 to 170 hours prior to critical failure. These results demonstrate that the proposed system will collect relevant data to generate predictive maintenance plans and avoid unplanned downtimes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9324826/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

A penicillin fermentation process is a highly complex and nonlinear dynamic process with batch processing. A data-driven approach is utilized for fault diagnostics due to the availability of huge batch processing data and the unavailability of an analytical model. To address the non-linearity, a subspace-aided parity-based residual generation technique is proposed by using a just-in-time learning approach. For the just-in-time learning approach, the most similar data samples are selected from the database for incoming test samples and a subspace aided parity-based residual is generated using these samples. The designed fault detection technique is implemented for the penicillin fermentation process to demonstrate real-time health monitoring of the process under sensor noise and process disturbances. Two sensor faults and an actuator fault are considered and successfully detected using the proposed technique. Further, a fault isolation approach is developed to isolate these faults and their location has been identified. A case study is given to show the improvement offered by the proposed technique for the fault detection rate and minimization of the false alarm rate as compared to the existing techniques for the penicillin fermentation process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420045/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Most devices in a smart home access the Internet through a home gateway (HGW). In this paper, we propose a software-definednetwork (SDN)-HGW framework to better manage distributed smart home networks and support the SDN controller of the core network. The SDN controller enables efficient network quality-of-service management based on real-time traffic monitoring and resource allocation of the core network. However, it cannot provide network management in distributed smart homes. Our proposed SDN-HGW extends the control to the access network, i.e., a smart home network, for better end-to-end network management. Specifically, the proposed SDN-HGW can achieve distributed application awareness by classifying data traffic in a smart home network. Most existing traffic classification solutions, e.g., deep packet inspection, cannot provide real-time application awareness for encrypted data traffic. To tackle those issues, we develop encrypted data classifiers (denoted as DataNets) based on three deep learning schemes, i.e., multilayer perceptron, stacked autoencoder, and convolutional neural networks, using an open data set that has over 200 000 encrypted data samples from 15 applications. A data preprocessing scheme is proposed to process raw data packets and the tested data set so that DataNet can be created. The experimental results show that the developed DataNets can be applied to enable distributed application-aware SDN-HGW in future smart home networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8473682/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

For machine health monitoring systems (MHMS), major efforts have been put into designing and deploying more and more complex machine learning models. Those black-box models are nontransparent toward their working mechanism. However, this research trend brings huge potential risks in real life. Since machine health monitoring itself belongs to high stake decision applications, the outputs of the autonomous monitoring systems should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: why the deployed MHMS predicts what they predict. In this article, we shed some light on this meaningful research direction: explainable MHMSs (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can not only make a diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), to balance precision-explainability tradeoff. Specifically, feature information and temporal information have been encoded in different stages of our model. The spatial attention module is added to boost the performance of the model.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in CO<sub>x</sub> sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133296/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,May-June 2012,ieeexplore

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&amp;G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&amp;G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&amp;G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&amp;G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&amp;G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&amp;G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&amp;G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&amp;G industry.

Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those.

However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost.

Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard of detecting OSA, requires multiple specialized sensors for signal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals and bear the costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor alternatives have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience. Among these methods, solutions based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between two consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory balance among comfort, portability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval based OSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy perspectives. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped on smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and wristbands), the energy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an overnight observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors are unable to keep collecting continuous signals due to the limited battery capacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore, we propose a novel Frequency Extraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different frequency bands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection results with downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of the one-to-multiple structure, FENet requires only one-third of the operation time of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down the energy consumption and enabling overnight diagnosis.

Second, multiple GANs were adopted to generate various fault spectrum data and the data selection module (DSM) is elaborately designed to filter and purify these data. Third, the filtered generated data will be combined with the real data to form a balanced dataset, and then the MSCNN is used to achieve multiclassification of the health status of the harmonic drive. Finally, the experiments have been implemented on an industrial robot vibration test bench to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results have shown the fault multiclassification accuracy as 98.49% under imbalanced fault data conditions, which outperforms that of the other compared methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9454583/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2021,ieeexplore

Providing accurate environmental sensing services is of great significance. To realize environmental sensing, distributed monitoring sites are used to collect comprehensive long-term environmental data. However, sparse sensory data caused by insufficient monitoring sites and their incomplete records become the main challenge of fine-grained environment sensing. At the same time, due to the limitations of network bandwidth and storage space, traditional centralized training is difficult to meet the task training requirements based on big data. In this paper, we develop a novel distributed inference framework, named Federated Region-Learning (FRL) for urban environment sensing. It inherits the basic idea of federated learning avoiding transmission and centralized storage of data, and also considers the regional characteristics of each monitoring site. Through an elaborate designed edge computing system, a local regional model is customized for the micro cloud to improve the inference accuracy. Moreover, we develop two types of global model aggregation strategies to better target different bandwidth requirements.

The smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. Devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. Unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an IoT network is to disrupt the availability of IoT data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. Detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the IoT device itself due to its limited computational resources. Furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats.

Learn from the advantages and disadvantages of the thermodynamic model based and data-driven artificial intelligence based gas-path diagnosis methods, a newfangled gas turbine gas-path diagnosis approach on the basis of knowledge data-driven artificial intelligence is proposed. That is a hybrid method of deep learning and gas path analysis. First, gas turbine thermodynamic model of the object to be diagnosed is constructed by adaptation modeling strategy.

Most of these studies have focused on predicting failures of hard drives, i.e., labeling the status of a hard drive as “good” or not. However, in real-world storage systems, hard drives often deteriorate gradually rather than suddenly. Correspondingly, their SMART attributes change continuously towards failure. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to assess the health statuses of hard drives based on the gradually changing sequential SMART attributes. Compared to a simple failure prediction method, a health status assessment is more valuable in practice because it enables technicians to schedule the recovery of different hard drives according to the level of urgency.

In this paper, we presented, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth security analysis on home-use electroencephalography (EEG) IoT devices. Our key contributions are twofold. First, we reverse-engineered the home-use EEG system framework via which we identified the design and implementation flaws. By exploiting these flaws, we developed two sets of novel easy-to-exploit PoC attacks, which consist of four remote attacks and one proximate attack. In a remote attack, an attacker can steal a user's brain wave data through a carefully crafted program while in the proximate attack, the attacker can steal a victim's brain wave data over-the-air without accessing the victim's device on any sense when he is close to the victim. As a result, all the 156 brain-computer interface (BCI) apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to the proximate attack. We also discovered that all the 31 free apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to at least one remote attack. Second, we proposed a novel deep learning model of a joint recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to infer a user's activities based on the reduced-featured EEG data stolen from the home-use EEG IoT devices, and our evaluation over the real-world EEG data indicates that the inference accuracy of the proposed RCNN is can reach 70.55%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8685117/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

Further, the MC-LSTM accelerator supports parallel inference on up to 64 input channels. The implementation on Xilinx ZCU104 reaches a throughput of 18 658 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and an inference latency of 3.5 ms with the batch size of 64. Accordingly, the power consumption is 3.6 W for the whole FPGA+ARM system, which is 37.8x and 10.4x more energy-efficient than the high-end Titan X GPU and i7-9700 CPU, respectively. Meanwhile, our accelerator also keeps a 4 ~ 5x energy efficiency advantage against the low-power high-performance Firefly-RK3399 board carrying an ARM Cortex-A72+A53 CPU. We further synthesize an 8-bit quantized version on the same hardware, providing a 48.8% increase in energy efficiency under the same throughput.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373938/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems,April 2021,ieeexplore

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427992/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore

In this work, we find a correlation between the particulate matter (PM) found indoors and the outside weather with the PEFR. The PEFR results are classified into three categories such as ‘Green’ (Safe), ‘Yellow’ (Moderate Risk) and ‘Red’ (High Risk) conditions in comparison to the best peak flow value obtained by each individual. Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to map the relationship between the indoor PM and weather data to the PEFR values.

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set. Experimental results show that our model's predictive ability is better than the best models available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9138732/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

These applications include physical health tracking, surveillance systems, and robotic assistive technologies. Despite the wide range of applications, classification and recognition of human activities remains imprecise and this may contribute to unfavorable reactions and responses. To improve the recognition of human activities, we designed a dataset in which ten participants (five male and five female) performed 11 different activities wearing three body-worn inertial sensors in different locations on the body. Our model extracts data via a hierarchical feature-based technique. These features include time, wavelet, and time-frequency domains, respectively. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is then introduced to optimize selective features. The selected features with optimized patterns are further processed by multi-layered kernel sliding perceptron to develop adaptive learning for the classification of physical human activities. Our proposed model was experimentally evaluated and applied on three benchmark datasets: IM-WSHA, a self-annotated dataset, PAMAP2 dataset which is comprised of daily living activities, and an HuGaDB, a dataset which contains physical activities for aging people.

This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F<sub>z</sub> 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). Conclusion: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing. The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study.

NICUs are equipped with multiple vital sign monitoring devices that are connected to the premature newborn and acquire a few gigabytes of data every day. The continuous vital data from these devices are manually documented every hour. This introduces errors and loses a large amount of high-resolution data. The intermittent documentation of physiological data also makes it difficult for clinicians to visualize and detect the trends of diagnostic utility.

However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings. Experimental results on the benchmark tasks show that PKRLS obtains a parsimonious network structure with the satisfactory prediction accuracy. Finally, a multi-sensor health diagnosis approach based on PKRLS is developed for identifying the health state of a degraded aero-engine in realtime.

The accurate identification of patients with similar conditions based on EHRs is a key step in personalized healthcare. Existing studies model EHRs by medical knowledge graph embedding to learn the latent embeddings of medical entities (e.g., patients, medications, diagnoses and procedures). However, such precisely structured data is usually limited in quantity and in scope. Therefore, to enhance the quality of the embeddings it is important to consider more widely available medical information such as medical entity descriptions. In this paper we propose a novel framework, called Deep Patient Similarity (DeepPS). Specifically, DeepPS incorporates medical entity descriptions by augmenting the embeddings of medical entities and relations with the embeddings of words, which leverages both information from medical knowledge graph structures and the contexts of medical entity descriptions.

The number of identified samples is largely different for each emotion, which results in an imbalanced dataset problem. This research proposes the dimensional model of emotions as a perceptual representation space alternative to the generally used acoustic one. The main contribution of the paper is the definition of a perceptual borderline for the oversampling of minority emotion classes in this space. This limit, based on arousal and valence criteria, leads to two methods of balancing the data: the Perceptual Borderline oversampling and the Perceptual Borderline SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique). Both methods are implemented and compared to state-of-the-art approaches of Random oversampling and SMOTE. The experimental evaluation was carried out on three imbalanced datasets of spontaneous emotions acquired in human-machine scenarios in three different cultures: Spain, France and Norway.

Bayesian estimation algorithms adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set of random samples (or particles) with associated weights.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format.

In order to train such tracking algorithms in NE, however, annotated data is needed, particularly when tracking a variety of activities of daily living. These algorithms are often trained in laboratory settings, with expectations that they will perform equally well in NE, which is often not the case; they must be trained on annotated data collected in NE and wearable computers provide opportunities to collect such data, though the process is burdensome. Therefore, we propose an intelligent scoring algorithm that limits the number of user annotation requests through the confidence of predictions generated by the tracking algorithm and automatically annotating data with high confidence. We enhance our scoring algorithm by providing improvements in our tracking algorithm by obtaining context data from nearable sensors. Each specific context of a user bounds the set of activities that can likely occur, which in turn improves the tracking algorithm and confidence. Finally, we propose a hierarchical annotation approach, where repeated use allows us to ask for detailed annotations that differentiate fine-grained differences in ways individuals perform activities. We validate our approach in a diet monitoring case study. We vary the number of annotations requested per day to evaluate model accuracy; we improve accuracy in NE by 8% when restricting requests to 20 per day and improve F1-score of activities by 11% with hierarchical annotations, while discussing implementation, accuracy, and power consumption in real-time use.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8957125/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/WETICE49692.2020.00032,A Learning based Secure Anomaly Detection for Healthcare Applications,IEEE,Conferences,"The wireless body sensor network (WBSN) is an emerging technology in the healthcare domain, which collects data from vital parameters of the patient's body, using small portable components such as sensors. It allows to continuously monitor patients without restricting their movements and to inform the health specialist of the evolution of their states. However, the deployment of new technologies in health applications without taking into account data security makes the privacy of patients vulnerable. Thus, these systems have insufficient performance for large and varied data sets, because they do not process information sufficiently diverse to cover all scenarios. Moreover, the interpretation of physiological signals is a tedious process in which human errors can be caused.To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an effective health system that ensures the secure collection and transfer of patient data to the physician, to facilitate the diagnosis and the detection of life threatening diseases. Our main contribution is to offer real-time, high quality processing, learning and analysis capabilities, in a smart and secure system. For that, we have collected real patient datasets from Tunisian doctors.To achieve this goal, we used ANN and XgBoost as learning algorithms and AES as an encryption protocol for sending secure data to medical personnel for diagnostic purposes.

10.1109/BIOSMART.2019.8734185,An IoT-Cloud Based Solution for Real-Time and Batch Processing of Big Data: Application in Healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"With the large use of Internet of Things (IoT) today, everything around us seems to generate data. The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting. We analyze the performance of the implemented system in terms of response time by varying the velocity and volume of the analyzed data. We also discuss how the cloud resources should be provisioned in order to guarantee processing performance for both long-term and real-time scenarios.

In order to ensure success with the VILIAlert system, the ideal scenario is to ensure that as soon as patients in the Intensive Care Unit experience tidal volume values beyond the 8 ml/kg level, a clinical intervention can be carried out so to minimise the risk of patients ever having permanent damage.

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1].

Huge amount of addition to the financial cost, lack of data integration and loss of information affects the ability to maintain standards in clinical care delivery and patient outcomes. This paper proposes that the solution to these issues is an augmented network of clinical note taking, where coding is automatically generated by an AI system as clinicians write their clinical notes.

Today, commercial devices, which implement simplified BAN monitoring have appeared, although they usually imply expensive subscription costs or need for a supporting device carried by the user (e.g. a smart phone) which, in case of elderly people, cannot be easily held. However, the integration between commercial devices and external sensors located on/in the body is still an open issue due to the limited processing capabilities of low cost commercial devices. Also, no tools for anomaly detection aimed at reliable healthcare monitoring are currently commercially available. In this paper, we focus on Cloud-Assisted BANs and evolve this vision according to the emerging paradigm of edge computing. We present design, implementation and experimentation of a wireless BAN system which performs data transmission using a commercial, cheap, off-the-shelf gateway smart watch. A mechanism for prompt anomaly detection at the edge node is also supported for the purpose of reliable healthcare monitoring as well as pre-filtering of the data at the smart device itself. Also, in order to reduce the overhead caused by propagation of useless and time-correlated data, and to guarantee a prompt action in case of emergency, edge network nodes located closer to the patient BAN are exploited since they can execute machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and activate potential alerts in a shorter time and without overloading the cloud.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification.

However, the application does not take security into account enough because most systems are connected to the Internet. The system should be protected from a wide variety of risks to keep both personal data and sensors safe. Therefore, we developed SinkNet.

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims.

Furthermore, in order to raise alert of traffic or dangerous scenarios, an `urban-emergency' classifier is developed using a deep learning model, Inception-v4, with transfer learning to detect/recognize alerting/alarming sounds, such as a horn sound or a fire alarm, with texts generated to alert the prospective user. The training of Inception-v4 was carried out on a consumer desktop PC and then implemented into the AI-based IoT application. The empirical results indicate that the developed prototype system achieves an accuracy rate of 92% for sound recognition and classification with real-time performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9469537/,2020 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC),2-2 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621477,A Deep Predictive Model in Healthcare for Inpatients,IEEE,Conferences,"With the exponential growth of clinical data which are longitudinal, sparse and heterogeneous, deep learning methods are receiving increasingly attention for predictive tasks in healthcare. These methods have strong abilities to extract low-dimensional representations for prediction from patient's historical information without human intervention. However, most of existing deep learning approaches focus on predictive tasks of outpatients, such as disease progression, readmission risk and so on. Considering the differences about data characteristics and prediction goals between outpatients and inpatients, these outpatient-oriented methods are not suitable for inpatients. In this study, we propose an end-to-end predictive model for inpatients called DPMI to address the challenges about fixed diagnosis and time irregularity. DPMI is a modified Long-Short Term Memory network with three kinds of representations and an attention mechanism. For an inpatient visit that consist of several days, the guidance role of diagnosis for the days and the temporal relation among the days are utilized by DPMI to learn the representation of the visit. Our experiments on large real-world data demonstrate that DPMI achieves significant improvement in prediction accuracy of two typical inpatient predictive tasks, and the prediction outputs are easy to interpret.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621477/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),3-6 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

It allows to continuously monitor patients without restricting their movements and to inform the health specialist of the evolution of their states. However, the deployment of new technologies in health applications without taking into account data security makes the privacy of patients vulnerable. Thus, these systems have insufficient performance for large and varied data sets, because they do not process information sufficiently diverse to cover all scenarios. Moreover, the interpretation of physiological signals is a tedious process in which human errors can be caused.To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an effective health system that ensures the secure collection and transfer of patient data to the physician, to facilitate the diagnosis and the detection of life threatening diseases. Our main contribution is to offer real-time, high quality processing, learning and analysis capabilities, in a smart and secure system. For that, we have collected real patient datasets from Tunisian doctors.To achieve this goal, we used ANN and XgBoost as learning algorithms and AES as an encryption protocol for sending secure data to medical personnel for diagnostic purposes.

However, the accumulation of potentially relevant data in databases contributes little to healthcare services improvement. It is crucial to apply models to identify the underlying system failures, the root causes that led to the event and enhance the sharing of knowledge and experience. In the real world complete information is hard to obtain, so systems should have the ability to reason with incomplete information. We developed a model to classify the adverse events root causes in the medical imaging field where our logic programming approach allows the representation of incomplete information. In this paper we present a model for the adverse events root causes classification in the medical imaging field and an adverse event reporting and learning system that applies the developed model.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

While these models achieve increasingly better predictive performance, their structures have also become much more complex. A common and difficult problem for complex models is overfitting. Regularization is used to penalize the complexity of the model in order to avoid overfitting. However, in most learning frameworks, regularization function is usually set as some hyper parameters, and therefore the best setting is difficult to find. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization method, as part of a large end-to-end healthcare data analytics software stack, which effectively addresses the above difficulty. First, we propose a general adaptive regularization method based on Gaussian Mixture (GM) to learn the best regularization function according to the observed parameters. Second, we develop an effective update algorithm which integrates Expectation Maximization (EM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Third, we design a lazy update algorithm to reduce the computational cost by 4x. The overall regularization framework is fast, adaptive and easy-to-use.

Real-time and accurate objective pain assessment help hospital staffs and caregivers decide the proper dosage of pain medication to be provided to a patient in a timely manner. The state-of-the-art automatic and objective pain assessment techniques in the literature can be classified into two main categories: physiological-based and behavioral-based. The first-class monitors the changes in patients' physiological data such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Photoplethysmography (PPG) to identify autonomic nervous system reactions to pain, while the second class utilizes behavioral reactions to pain such as techniques using computer vision-based techniques by extracting features from patients' head poses and facial expressions. Recent pain monitoring systems have become multi-modal meaning that they deploy a combination of both approaches to improve pain monitoring accuracy. Although such complex models are highly accurate in pain monitoring, they are more computationally intensive imposing feasibility limitations to implement them on wearable devices in terms of energy efficiency (battery life) as well as computation latency. A smart and self-aware system capable of adaptively making a decision at run-time in response to the changes in pain level and context can minimize energy consumption by dynamically offloading tasks to the gateway devices at the edge layer.

PAC-DSS (Pharmaceutical Acquisition Capability Decision Support Service) is an innovative decision support service that enables hospitals to pool together and share information to better understand current market prices and run analytics on drug prices in order to improve their operating costs. Our service allows users to interact with real pricing data to dissect various factors that can contribute to acquisition capabilities of individual drugs such as specific brand names or groups of drugs such as all brands of a given generic drug, without sacrificing individual providers' privacy as we do not disclose individual purchase prices. In developing PAC-DSS, we have had to address a range of technical challenges such as data privacy and alignment of disparate drug ontologies. In this paper, we describe PAC-DSS's service architecture, analytic services, and the benefit of PAC-DSS on improving healthcare services by lowering operating cost without sacrificing service quality. We also discuss the initial benefits from deployment of the service currently hosted by the Ministry of Public Health.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6311047/,2012 Annual SRII Global Conference,24-27 July 2012,ieeexplore

10.1109/BIOSMART.2019.8734185,An IoT-Cloud Based Solution for Real-Time and Batch Processing of Big Data: Application in Healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"With the large use of Internet of Things (IoT) today, everything around us seems to generate data. The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting. We analyze the performance of the implemented system in terms of response time by varying the velocity and volume of the analyzed data. We also discuss how the cloud resources should be provisioned in order to guarantee processing performance for both long-term and real-time scenarios. To ensure a good tradeoff between cost and processing performance, resources provision should be adapted to the exact needs and characteristics of the considered application.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734185/,2019 3rd International Conference on Bio-engineering for Smart Technologies (BioSMART),24-26 April 2019,ieeexplore

For the prototype system, we developed an Android widget application for the user interface and a Java-based server application which learns structure from training data and provides inference results in real-time. To gather training data and evaluate proposed system, we conducted a pilot study which showed 69% of accuracy in predicting the user's application usage.

Yet there is rarely any research study on the possible uses of smart watches for learning analytics, particularly for analyzing students' learning activities through the physiological and/or movement data collected on their smart watches. This paper considers a pioneering and sophisticated learning analytics platform using fine-tuned deep learning models to predict students' learning activities based on the real-time data, including their heart rates, calories, three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data, captured on wearable devices and then uploaded onto a cloud server for thorough analyses.

Firstly, semantic similarity transition is proposed to calculate the similarity between two resources.

10.1109/WiMOB.2019.8923286,Design and Deployment of a Wireless BAN at the Edge for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"Body Area Networks (BANs) have attracted a lot of research interest in the last decades as also witnessed by standardization activities and European Commission fundings. Today, commercial devices, which implement simplified BAN monitoring have appeared, although they usually imply expensive subscription costs or need for a supporting device carried by the user (e.g. a smart phone) which, in case of elderly people, cannot be easily held. However, the integration between commercial devices and external sensors located on/in the body is still an open issue due to the limited processing capabilities of low cost commercial devices. Also, no tools for anomaly detection aimed at reliable healthcare monitoring are currently commercially available. In this paper, we focus on Cloud-Assisted BANs and evolve this vision according to the emerging paradigm of edge computing. We present design, implementation and experimentation of a wireless BAN system which performs data transmission using a commercial, cheap, off-the-shelf gateway smart watch. A mechanism for prompt anomaly detection at the edge node is also supported for the purpose of reliable healthcare monitoring as well as pre-filtering of the data at the smart device itself. Also, in order to reduce the overhead caused by propagation of useless and time-correlated data, and to guarantee a prompt action in case of emergency, edge network nodes located closer to the patient BAN are exploited since they can execute machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and activate potential alerts in a shorter time and without overloading the cloud.

In this research, we applied three approaches to find a solution to this most challenging attacks issues. In the first approach, we implemented Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to discover and classify XSS attack. In the second approach, we implemented the Content Security Policy (CSP) approach to detect XSS attacks in real-time. In the last approach, we propose a new approach that combines the Web Application Firewall (WAF), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and prevent XSS attack in real-time.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

Single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide the ability to detect, classify, and even predict cardiac arrhythmia. In this paper we propose a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves high accuracy while still being feasible for wearable platform use. Experimental results on the ECG5000 dataset show that the TCN has a similar accuracy (94.2%) score as the state-of-the-art (SoA) network while achieving an improvement of 16.5% in the balanced accuracy score. This accurate classification is done with 27x fewer parameters and 37x less multiply-accumulate operations. We test our implementation on two publicly available platforms, the STM32L475, which is based on ARM Cortex M4F, and the GreenWaves Technologies GAP8 on the GAPuino board, based on 1+8 RISC-V CV32E40P cores.

IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network.

Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience.

However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks.

Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques.

In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data.

All signals were divided in 5s-windows and processed to extract 342 features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains. By means of two feature selection steps (correlation-based and genetic algorithm), we reduced the number of features to 69. These features were used as input for the following 5 classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). Our results showed that all classifiers were able to correctly recognize more than 90% of activities. The best performances were obtained by KNN. Analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each classifier for its implementation by means of a microcontroller the most suitable was DT. In fact, this classifier can be easily implemented, it has low memory and computational requirements, and it allows for a further reduction of the required features.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8438750/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA),11-13 June 2018,ieeexplore

However, there is a lack of an implemented framework that is technically feasible, easily scalable and that provides meaningful variables to be used in applications for translational medicine. This paper describes the implementation and early evaluation of a physiological sensing tool that collects and processes photoplethysmography data from a wearable smartwatch to calculate heart rate variability in real-time. A technical open-source framework is outlined, involving mobile devices for collection of heart rate data, feature extraction and execution of data mining or machine learning algorithms that ultimately deliver mobile health interventions tailored to the users. Eleven volunteers participated in the empirical evaluation that was carried out using an existing mobile virtual reality application for mental health and under controlled slow-paced breathing exercises. The results validated the feasibility of implementation of the proposed framework in the stages of signal acquisition and real-time calculation of heart rate variability (HRV).

Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem.

Deep learning has been extensively utilized in various IoT applications which require huge amount of data for model training. Due to privacy requirements, smart IoT devices do not release data to a remote third party for their use. To overcome this problem, collaborative approach to deep learning, also known as Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) has been largely employed in data-driven applications. This approach enables multiple edge IoT devices to train their models locally on mobile edge devices. In this paper, we address IoT device training problem in CDL by analyzing the behavior of mobile edge devices using a game-theoretic model, where each mobile edge device aims at maximizing the accuracy of its local model at the same time limiting the overhead of participating in CDL.

In big data systems, machine learning plays an important role due to its effectiveness in discovering hidden information and valuable knowledge. Data privacy, however, becomes an unavoidable concern since big data usually involve multiple organizations, e.g., different healthcare systems and hospitals, who are not in the same trust domain and may be reluctant to share their data publicly. Applying traditional cryptographic tools is a straightforward approach to protect sensitive information, but it often renders learning algorithms useless inevitably. In this work, we, for the first time, propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme for canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which is a well-known learning technique and has been widely used in cross-media retrieval system. We first develop a library of building blocks to support various arithmetics over encrypted real numbers by leveraging additively homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits. Then we encrypt private data by randomly splitting the numerical data, formalize CCA problem and reduce it to a symmetric eigenvalue problem by designing new protocols for privacy-preserving QR decomposition. Finally, we solve all the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors by running Newton-Raphson method and inverse power method over the ciphertext domain. We carefully analyze the security and extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our design. The results show that our scheme is practically secure, incurs negligible errors compared with performing CCA in the clear and performs comparably in cross-media retrieval systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8056955/,IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,1-4 May 2017,ieeexplore

The incident acoustic pressure most sensitive to ambient pressure fluctuations was determined; then the ambient pressure was tracked over 20 seconds. Regression analysis compared subharmonic and catheter pressure values. In vivo validation of this technique was performed noninvasively for tracking left ventricular (LV) pressures of two canines using similar post processing as in vitro. The subharmonic signal tracked ambient pressures with r<sup>2</sup> = 0.922 for 20 seconds in vitro. In vivo the subharmonic signal tracked the LV pressures with r<sup>2</sup> &gt;; 0.7P90. Maximum errors in estimating clinically relevant systolic and diastolic pressures ranged from 0.22 to 2.84 mmHg using this subharmonic technique relative to Millar catheter pressures. Clinical validation and real time implementation of this technique may ultimately lead to the first noninvasive cardiac pressure monitoring tool.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6293674/,2011 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium,18-21 Oct. 2011,ieeexplore

In the field of advanced manufacturing however, the impact has been significantly lesser than expected due to limitations in cloud platforms for fostering community engagement. To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “WheelSim” App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform. Our ontology integration results show benefits to an App developer in terms of: optimal user experience, lower design time and lower cost/simulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7140329/,2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM),11-15 May 2015,ieeexplore

Due to its highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics, it requires more semantic interactions between different scenarios. Therefore, interoperability is one of the most fundamental requirements for IoT systems. Currently, semantic modeling for IoT applications has significant deficiency in its reusability and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a semantic information model for IoT applications, named OntoIoT. This model has a two-level architecture including a set of general upper ontology and flexible interfaces for different application domain ontology extensions. We have preliminarily implemented the OntoIoT framework and domain extension in selected scenarios of smart space and healthcare.

Specifically recurrent architectures based on long-short term memory (LSTM) cells have manifested excellent capability to model time dependencies in real-world data. However, standard recurrent architectures cannot estimate their uncertainty which is essential for safety-critical applications such as in medicine. In contrast, Bayesian recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to provide uncertainty estimation with improved accuracy. Nonetheless, Bayesian RNNs are computationally and memory demanding, which limits their practicality despite their advantages. To address this issue, we propose an FPGA-based hardware design to accelerate Bayesian LSTM-based RNNs. To further improve the overall algorithmic-hardware performance, a co-design framework is proposed to explore the most fitting algorithmic-hardware configurations for Bayesian RNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on healthcare applications to demonstrate the improvement of our design and the effectiveness of our framework.

Most of these insulin pump systems have limited security mechanisms embedded to protect them from malicious attacks. In this paper, two attacks against insulin pump systems via wireless links are investigated: a single acute overdose with a significant amount of medication, and chronic overdose with an insignificant amount of extra medication over a long time period, e.g., several months. These attacks can be launched unobtrusively and may jeopardize patients' lives. It is very important and urgent to protect patients from these attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel patient infusion pattern based access control scheme (PIPAC) for wireless insulin pumps. This scheme employs a supervised learning approach to learn normal patient infusions pattern with the dosage amount, rate, and time of infusion, which are automatically recorded in insulin pump logs. The generated regression models are used to dynamically configure a safety infusion range for abnormal infusion identification. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real insulin pump logs used by several patients for up to 6 months. The evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme can reliably detect the single overdose attack with a success rate up to 98% and defend against the chronic overdose attack with a very high success rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6567115/,2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,14-19 April 2013,ieeexplore

Therefore, a lightweight and ready-to-go approach that is able to detect anomalies in real-time is highly sought-after. Such an approach could be easily and immediately applied to perform time series anomaly detection on any commodity machine. The approach could provide timely anomaly alerts and by that enable appropriate countermeasures to be undertaken as early as possible. With these goals in mind, this paper introduces ReRe, which is a Real-time Ready-to-go proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for streaming time series.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values.

However the challenges still remain: (1) they often rely on a large amount of labelled training data to build the model, and (2) they cannot dynamically adapt the model with emerging or changing activity patterns over time. To directly address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model, i.e. Dirichlet process mixture of conditionally independent von Mises Fisher models, to enable both unsupervised and semi-supervised dynamic learning of human activities.

10.1109/DICTA.2018.8615804,Similar Gesture Recognition using Hierarchical Classification Approach in RGB Videos,IEEE,Conferences,"Recognizing human actions from the video streams has become one of the very popular research areas in computer vision and deep learning in the recent years. Action recognition is wildly used in different scenarios in real life, such as surveillance, robotics, healthcare, video indexing and human-computer interaction. The challenges and complexity involved in developing a video-based human action recognition system are manifold. In particular, recognizing actions with similar gestures and describing complex actions is a very challenging problem. To address these issues, we study the problem of classifying human actions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and develop a hierarchical 3DCNN architecture for similar gesture recognition. The proposed model firstly combines similar gesture pairs into one class, and classify them along with all other class, as a stage-1 classification. In stage-2, similar gesture pairs are classified individually, which reduces the problem to binary classification. We apply and evaluate the developed models to recognize the similar human actions on the HMDB51 dataset. The result shows that the proposed model can achieve high performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8615804/,2018 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA),10-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/AIVR.2018.00020,SinkNet: Interactive Sink to Detect Living Habits for Healthcare and Quality of Life Using Private Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"With the development of IoT applications, a wide variety of healthcare systems are available. A decrease in birthrate and an aging population have led to increased importance of health care for older adults. In such environments, a monitoring system is useful, in which a targeted person can be continuously viewed through a camera, and reports regarding the person's health can be automatically transmitted through email. However, the application does not take security into account enough because most systems are connected to the Internet. The system should be protected from a wide variety of risks to keep both personal data and sensors safe. Therefore, we developed SinkNet. This program connects several sensors and constructs a private network that can automatically perform a series of actions for client devices, such as collecting logs, detecting problems through machine learning, and checking to avoid and solve problems. In addition, SinkNet manipulates multiple sensors and recognizes living habits (e.g., hand and face washing, gargling) from the sound of water flow and talks interactively to users through synthetic sounds.

We developed a prototype using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that was tested on real-world pathological speech data from telemonitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Proposed architecture employed machine learning for analysis of pathological speech data obtained from smart watches worn by the patients with PD.

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis (unhealthy individuals). We evaluated the proposed approach using available physiological sensor data from Physionet databases, and achieved 38% energy reduction in comparison to the conventional deep learning approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8036767/,2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),11-15 July 2017,ieeexplore

Many neurological diseases like paralysis are caused by the interruption of spike propagation due to the malfunctioning neurons in the signaling pathway where the spikes are carried. In this paper, we propose a neuron specific statistical multiplexing scheme to substitute a faulty sensory neural pathway with a neighboring functional one. Since the spikes are stereotyped events and they have no addressing information, we developed an addressing scheme utilizing the spikes themselves. The performance achieved by the proposed technique is analyzed in terms of the percentage of the spikes transmitted under various scenarios. We also compared the results obtained with the previously proposed TDMA based multiplexing schemes. The proposed statistical multiplexing based technique has lower implementation complexity than the previously introduced TDMA based techniques. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed technique when a priority mechanism is employed. The concept of multiplexing spikes to substitute a faulty neural pathway with a functional pathway reveals new opportunities in neuronal communication and may pave the way to the real healthcare applications of nanonetworking in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7002111/,2014 6th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT),6-8 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore

At the same time, there is a growing excitement about the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in order to mitigate these inefficiencies. Many of the AI initiatives in healthcare are generally focused on highly domain specific solutions. There has not been widespread adoption of systemic solutions proposed. Improving care coordination is a national priority in the US and it is thought to be critical to avoiding unnecessarily hospitalizations. Given the increase in the aging population and the mounting complexity of care dynamics as patients age, the time is ripe to apply systems thinking approaches to model the dynamics of these complex care trajectories with the implication of utilizing AI technologies to augment care transitions.

10.1109/AITest.2019.00011,Test-Driven Anonymization for Artificial Intelligence,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, data published and shared with third parties to develop artificial intelligence (AI) tools and services has significantly increased. When there are regulatory or internal requirements regarding privacy of data, anonymization techniques are used to maintain privacy by transforming the data. The side-effect is that the anonymization may lead to useless data to train and test the AI because it is highly dependent on the quality of the data. To overcome this problem, we propose a test-driven anonymization approach for artificial intelligence tools. The approach tests different anonymization efforts to achieve a trade-off in terms of privacy (non-functional quality) and functional suitability of the artificial intelligence technique (functional quality). The approach has been validated by means of two real-life datasets in the domains of healthcare and health insurance. Each of these datasets is anonymized with several privacy protections and then used to train classification AIs. The results show how we can anonymize the data to achieve an adequate functional suitability in the AI context while maintaining the privacy of the anonymized data as high as possible.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718230/,2019 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),4-9 April 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/AITEST49225.2020.00019,Test-Driven Anonymization in Health Data: A Case Study on Assistive Reproduction,IEEE,Conferences,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field whose prevalence in the health sector has increased during recent years. Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements. The results show that TDA can be successfully applied to anonymize the clinical data of the INEBIR, allowing third parties to transfer without transgressing user privacy and develop useful AI Tools with the anonymized data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176766/,2020 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),3-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

Unsurprisingly, the cybersecurity of MCPS is of high concern, as they are life-critical systems that, if compromised, may result in dire consequences to the patient. A variety of security requirements have been developed over the past 10 years as a result of governmental acts such as HITECH in order to better secure and protect healthcare environments. However, it is unclear how applicable these re-quirements may be to MCPS infrastructures. As a result, this case study analyzes current healthcare security requirements and their applicability to MCPS using an approach that leverages ontological representations and automated requirement traversal techniques. Using such a methodology, we find that 70% of applicable requirements/risks for MCPS components are missing from the security documentation, including serious items such as Authentication, Data Encryption, DoS attacks, and Legacy Vulnerabilities.

However, only few of the existing studies in the literature discuss how SHs should be designed by considering the unique requirements of PwDs. Most of the studies view dementia care as a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific needs of PwDs. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems to PwDs as well as other stakeholders in the sector of dementia care. The present research reports on the requirements elicitation, design and evaluation of a dedicated SH prototype for PwDs. In contrast to most of the existing SH systems proposed for PwDs, this work presents a tailored prototype that is based on a user-centred design methodology.

This opens up exciting new possibilities for applications in various domains including: education, training, healthcare, and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Recognizing physical objects in the environment provides contextual clues that can improve user task performance and influence effective cognitive load for complex tasks. However, this facet of MR is still relatively nascent because of hardware limitations. Presently, MR headsets can only detect physical surfaces; they can not distinguish between physical artifacts that a user might need in their work environment. Machine Learning (ML) based object recognition solutions can help overcome this limitation. However, current commercially available MR devices have insufficient computational capabilities and are unable to support the state-of-the-art ML based object recognition solutions. To address these challenges, we describe a novel approach and the corresponding framework by introducing a hardware level separation between the two tasks of object recognition and rendering virtual components. Our approach leverages ML based object recognition, MR, and a portable IoT edge computing platform to support contextual awareness. We describe the implementation of this approach and provide a case study. The prototype implementation uses an edge device to process and recognize objects to get information about the user’s physical environment and provides the user with situational awareness through the MR device. Our case study uses a Christmas tree decoration activity to demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to support assembly-type tasks. The case study establishes the applicability of the proposed approach to a variety of problem domains.

But even the traditional structured datasets present problems that need to be addressed and overcome in the early stages of data pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection. This is because they usually contain variety of data formats, e.g., categorical, continuous, ordinal, and frequently missing data (usually result of sensors faults, human errors, collection, transportation, or storage problems). The most popular approaches in dealing with missing data generally fall in three groups: Deletion methods; Single imputation methods; and Model-based methods. In this tutorial I will talk about the third group methods, which are considered to be the most popular, 'modem' model-based approaches. Particularly, Multiple imputation (MI) method will be introduced and discussed in addition to the K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN-I) and Bagged Tree Imputation (BTI). Subsequently, MI, KNN-I and BTl will be applied in a case study for pre-processing a real world radar signal large dataset (more than 30 000 samples). The dataset comprises intercepted and collected pulse train characteristics, which typically include signal frequencies, type of modulation, scan period, pulse repetition intervals, etc., and usually consist of mixture of continuous, discrete and categorical data, and also frequently include missing values. Missing values are imminent part of real world datasets and radar datasets make no exception of that.

We evaluate this method on healthcare tasks related to Dementia and Parkinson's disease which involve real-world multi-modal speech and text data, wherein our method shows an improved performance. Additional analysis suggests that introducing uncertainty-awareness into the boosted ensembles decreases the overall entropy of the system, making it more robust to heteroscedasticity in the data, as well as better calibrating each of the modalities along with high quality prediction intervals.

Falls are known to be the second major factor of deaths in elderly by accidental or unwarranted injuries. When a fall occurs, lack of immediate help or action is the main problem, especially when bleeding is involved, as fall-related injuries are a life-threatening for many people. To prevent such kinds of deadly scenarios, a reliable fall detection system must be developed to help many lives. In this project, a wearable sensor-based fall detection system using a machine-learning algorithm had been developed. An application called `AndroSensor' on a smartphone, that retrieves real-time data from accelerometer, gyroscope and gravity sensors, is used as the input signals. The phone is placed at the most accurate position that had been done by past research which is waist position. When a fall event occurs, the real-time data is collected and placed in a *.CSV file. Then, a Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) is used to train and test the data before a classifier is used to classify the new incoming dataset. The fall event behaviour classification classes are sleep, walk, sit, front fall, back fall, side fall, etc. MATLAB software is currently used to analyse and visualize the data too. The MLA detects fall with efficient sensitivity (SP), specificity (SP), and accuracy.

Mobile-based dietary assessment systems that can record real-time images of the meal and analyze it for nutritional content can be very handy and improve the dietary habits and, therefore, result in a healthy life. This paper proposes a novel system to automatically estimate food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food. Our method employs different deep learning models for accurate food identification. In addition to image analysis, attributes and ingredients are estimated by extracting semantically related words from a huge corpus of text, collected over the Internet. We performed experiments with a dataset comprising 100 classes, averaging 1000 images for each class to acquire top 1 classification rate of up to 85%. An extension of a benchmark dataset Food-101 is also created to include sub-continental foods.

While the remarkable progress has been made for the development of SH, it still suffers from a number of issues (e.g., device heterogeneity, composite activities recognition, and providing appropriate services). To address these issues, this paper proposes a knowledge-based approach for multiagent (MA) collaboration. Specifically, a layered architecture of SH that combines ontology and MA technologies is designed to automatically acquire semantic knowledge, and support heterogeneity and interoperability services. In such architecture, a generic inference algorithm is presented based on unordered actions and temporal property of activity for inferring both continuous composite activity and personalized service in real time.

As this paradigm involves data collection from users, the issue of designing rewards to incentivize users is fundamentally important to ensure participation in crowdsensing. In this paper, we revisit this issue in the context of socially-aware crowdsensing which integrates crowdsensing into social networks. For example, in healthcare-based crowdsensing services, the fun of tracking daily nutrition information for a certain user can be promoted by comparing her nutritional information with that contributed and shared by her socially-connected friends. To be more general and practical, we study the incentive mechanisms in presence of multiple crowdsensing service providers and multiple users. Understanding the behaviors of users and service providers in socially-aware crowdsensing is of paramount importance for incentive mechanisms. With this focus, we propose a multi-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game approach to model the strategic interactions among service providers and users, where the social influence of users and the strategic interconnections of service providers are jointly and formally integrated into the game modeling.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905875,A Novel Definition of Equivalent Uniform Dose Based on Volume Dose Curve,IEEE,Journals,"With the improvement of mobile device performance, the requirement of equivalent dose description in intensity-modulated radiation therapy is increasing in mobile multimedia for healthcare. The emergence of mobile cloud computing will provide cloud servers and storage for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mobile applications, thus realizing visualized radiotherapy in a real sense. Equivalent uniform dose (EUD) is a biomedical indicator based on the dose measure. In this paper, the dose volume histogram is used to describe the dose distribution of different tissues in target and nontarget regions. The traditional definition of EUD, such as the exponential form and the linear form, has only a few parameters in the model for fast calculation. However, there is no close relationship between this traditional definition and the dose volume histogram. In order to establish the consistency between the EUD and the dose volume histogram, this paper proposes a novel definition of EUD based on the volume dose curve, called VD-EUD. By using a unique organic volume weight curve, it is easy to calculate VD-EUD for different dose distributions. In definition, different weight curves are used to represent the biological effects of different organs. For the target area, we should be more careful about those voxels with a low dose (cold point); thus, the weight curve is monotonically decreasing. While for the nontarget area, the curve is monotonically increasing. Furthermore, we present the curves for parallel, serial, and mixed organs of nontarget areas separately, and we define the weight curve form with only two parameters. Medical doctors can adjust the curve interactively according to different patients and organs. We also propose a fluence map optimization model with the VD-EUD constraint, which means that the proposed EUD constraint will lead to a large feasible solution space. We compare the generalized EUD (gEUD) and the proposed VD-EUD by experiments, which show that the VD-EUD has a closer relationship with the dose volume histogram. If the biological survival probability is equivalent to the VD-EUD, the feasible solution space would be large, and the target areas can be covered. By establishing a personalized organic weight curve, medical doctors can have a unique VD-EUD for each patient. By using the flexible and adjustable EUD definition, we can establish the VD-EUD-based fluence map optimization model, which will lead to a larger solution space than the traditional dose volume constraint-based model. The VD-EUD is a new definition; thus, we need more clinical testing and verification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673563/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments.

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims. However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with these problems. By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40000 users.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO.

Based on these factors, researchers have proposed various approaches for early diagnosis. However, the accuracy of proposed techniques and approaches needs certain improvements due to the inherent criticality and life threatening risks of cardiovascular diseases. In this article, a MaLCaDD (Machine Learning based Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis) framework is proposed for the effective prediction of cardiovascular diseases with high precision. Particularly, the framework first deals with the missing values (via mean replacement technique) and data imbalance (via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique - SMOTE). Subsequently, Feature Importance technique is utilized for feature selection. Finally, an ensemble of Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is proposed for prediction with higher accuracy. The validation of framework is performed through three benchmark datasets (i.e. Framingham, Heart Disease and Cleveland) and the accuracies of 99.1%, 98.0% and 95.5 % are achieved respectively. Finally, the comparative analysis proves that MaLCaDD predictions are more accurate (with reduced set of features) as compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Our proposed recommendation framework, named Collaborative Adversarial Autoencoders (CAAE), significantly extends the conventional IRGAN and GraphGAN as summarized below: 1) we use Autoencoder, which is one of the most successful deep neural networks, as our generator, instead of using the MF model; 2) we employ Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) as our discriminative model; and 3) we incorporate another generator model into our framework that focuses on generating negative items, which are items that a given user may not be interested in. We empirically test our framework using three real-life datasets along with four evaluation metrics. Owing to those extensions, our proposed framework not only produces considerably higher recommendation accuracy than the conventional GAN-based recommenders (i.e., IRGAN and GraphGAN), but also outperforms the other state-of-the-art top-N recommenders (i.e., BPR, PureSVD, and FISM).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8669749/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/TETC.2020.2975071,Collaborative Trajectory Mining in Smart-Homes to Support Early Diagnosis of Cognitive Decline,IEEE,Journals,"Our ageing world population claims for innovative tools to support healthcare and independent living. In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection. We implemented our algorithms and evaluated the system with a large dataset of real-world subjects, including people with dementia, MCI persons, and cognitively healthy people. The results indicate the potential utility of this system to support the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006820/,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,1 July-Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, an effective medical recommendation system that uses a fast Fourier transformation-coupled machine learning ensemble model is proposed for short-term disease risk prediction to provide chronic heart disease patients with appropriate recommendations about the need to take a medical test or not on the coming day based on analysing their medical data. The input sequence of sliding windows based on the patient's time series data are decomposed by using the fast Fourier transformation in order to extract the frequency information. A bagging-based ensemble model is utilized to predict the patient's condition one day in advance for producing the final recommendation. A combination of three classifiers-artificial neural network, least squares-support vector machine, and naive bayes-are used to construct an ensemble framework. A real-life time series telehealth data collected from chronic heart disease patients are utilized for experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed system yields a very good recommendation accuracy and offers an effective way to reduce the risk of incorrect recommendations as well as reduce the workload for heart disease patients in conducting body tests every day.

In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors.

Cloud-centric processing approaches for the IoT data suffer from high and unpredictable network latency, which causes poor experience in real-time IoT applications, such as healthcare. To address this issue, in edge computing, the data inference starts from the data source (i.e., the IoT devices). However, the constrained computational capabilities of the IoT device and the power-hungry data transmission demand a tradeoff between onboard processing and computation offloading. Hence, the IoT information inference requires efficient and lightweight techniques that are tailored for this tradeoff and respect the constrained resources on IoT devices, such as wearables. This article presents a hierarchical classification approach that decomposes the problem into three classifiers in two hierarchy layers. In the first layer, a lightweight classifier executes directly on the IoT device and decides whether to offload the computation to the gateway or to perform it onboard. The second layer comprises a lightweight classifier on the IoT device (can only distinguish a subset of classes) and a complex classifier on the gateway (to distinguish the remaining classes). The experimental results (using a real-world data set for human activity recognition and implemented on a wearable IoT device) show higher accuracy (92% on average) than a nonhierarchical classifier (87% on average). The execution time and power measurements on the IoT device show $3\times $ energy saving for the classification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9075280/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

While these models achieve increasingly better predictive performance, their structures have also become much more complex. A common and difficult problem for complex models is overfitting. Regularization is used to penalize the complexity of the model in order to avoid overfitting. However, in most learning frameworks, regularization function is usually set with some hyper-parameters where the best setting is difficult to find. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regularization method, as part of a large end-to-end healthcare data analytics software stack, which effectively addresses the above difficulty. First, we propose a general adaptive regularization method based on Gaussian Mixture (GM) to learn the best regularization function according to the observed parameters. Second, we develop an effective update algorithm which integrates Expectation Maximization (EM) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Third, we design a lazy update and sparse update algorithm to reduce the computational cost by 4x and 20x, respectively. The overall regularization framework is fast, adaptive, and easy-to-use. We validate the effectiveness of our regularization method through an extensive experimental study over 14 standard benchmark datasets and three kinds of deep learning/machine learning models.

Medical monitoring that works in an always-on edge platform needs the system processor to have extreme energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MC-LSTM, a functional and versatile 3D skeleton-based action detection system, for the above demands. Our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on trimmed and untrimmed cases of general-purpose and medical-specific datasets with early-detection features.

It provides in real time an early detection of specific motion disorders at their outset, with excellent performance in terms of sensitivity and precision. The system is composed of inertial measurement units, a station for the real-time processing (smartphone/tablet/PC), dedicated algorithms and, eventually, a headphone for auditory feedback. An auditory feedback can warn the patient about particularly dangerous situations as the freezing of gait in the case of Parkinsonian patients, and timely provide rhythmic auditory stimulations to release the gait block. Two different hard and soft implementations of the system are discussed in this paper. The first has just one sensor in a headset. This solution features a fine detection of body motion and in particular of trunk oscillations, easy wearability, through auditory feedback. It is particularly compact and energy efficient, since no wired/wireless connection is required to give the audio-feedback (which reflects on the battery life). However, the headset suffers of the presence of a joint (the neck), which can hide important features of very disordered gaits, as in the case of the Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative diseases. The second implementation has two sensors on the shins. It allows fine detection of gait features, and guarantees the best performance presented in the literature to date in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy in detection of the gait freezing. As a drawback, it requires an additional device in the ear for the audio-feedback, which implies higher power consumption respect to the headset device, for the wireless communication to the microphone.

Seizure detection is done in two stages. In the first stage, EEG signals are decomposed by the DWT into sub-bands and features (activity, signal complexity, and standard deviation) were extracted from each of these sub-bands. In the second stage, a deep neural network (DNN) classifier is used to classify the EEG data. A prototype of the proposed neuro-detect was implemented using the hardware-in-the-loop approach. The results demonstrate a significant difference in HP values between interictal and ictal EEG with ictal EEG being less complex than interictal EEG.

They can be launched unobtrusively and may jeopardize patients' lives. It is very urgent to protect patients from these attacks.

The generated regression models are used to dynamically configure a safe infusion range for abnormal infusion identification.

However, such precisely structured data is usually limited in quantity and in scope. Therefore, to enhance the quality of the embeddings it is important to consider more widely available medical information such as medical entity descriptions.

Specifically, DeepPS incorporates medical entity descriptions by augmenting the embeddings of medical entities and relations with the embeddings of words, which leverages both information from medical knowledge graph structures and the contexts of medical entity descriptions.

Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR).

Early readmission prediction enables early intervention, which is essential to preventing serious or life-threatening events, and act as a substantial contributor to reduce healthcare costs. Existing works on predicting readmission often focus on certain vital signs and diseases by extracting statistical features. They also fail to consider skewness of class labels in medical data and different costs of misclassification errors. In this paper, we recur to the merits of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn features from time series of vital sign, and categorical feature embedding to effectively encode feature vectors with heterogeneous clinical features, such as demographics, hospitalization history, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and all data is taken from historical EMR databases and reflects the kinds of data that would realistically be available at the clinical prediction system in hospitals. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. For example, using the general hospital wards data for 30-day readmission prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for the proposed model was 0.70, significantly higher than all the baseline methods.

Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced.

In this paper, we present a novel two-phase approach for detecting abnormal activities based on wireless sensors attached to a human body. Detecting abnormal activities is a particular important task in security monitoring and healthcare applications of sensor networks, among many others. Traditional approaches to this problem suffer from a high false positive rate, particularly when the collected sensor data are biased towards normal data while the abnormal events are rare. Therefore, there is a lack of training data for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem, our approach first employs a one-class support vector machine (SVM) that is trained on commonly available normal activities, which filters out the activities that have a very high probability of being normal. We then derive abnormal activity models from a general normal model via a kernel nonlinear regression (KNLR) to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. We show that our approach provides a good tradeoff between abnormality detection rate and false alarm rate, and allows abnormal activity models to be automatically derived without the need to explicitly label the abnormal training data, which are scarce.

Situation awareness in AAL is to determine the environment smartness by perceiving information related to the surroundings and human behavioral changes. In AAL environment, there are plenty of ways to collect data about its inhabitants, such as through cameras, microphones, and other sensors. The collected data are complicated enough to go for an efficient processing in perceiving the situation. This paper gives an overview of the existing research results in multimodal data analysis in AAL environment to improve the living environment of the seniors, and it attempts to bring efficiency in complex event processing for real-time situational awareness. This paper thus considers multimodal sensing for detection of current situations as well as to predict future situations using decision-tree and association analysis algorithms.

Services include massive machine type communications desired for Industrial 4.0 along with ultra-reliable low latency services for remote healthcare and vehicular communications. In this article, we present the design of intelligent and reconfigurable physical layer (PHY) to bring these services to reality. First, we design and implement the reconfigurable PHY via a hardware-software co-design approach on system-on-chip consisting of the ARM processor and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The reconfigurable PHY is then made intelligent by augmenting it with online machine learning (OML) based decision-making algorithm. Such PHY can learn the environment (for example, wireless channel) and dynamically adapt the transceivers' configuration (i.e., modulation scheme, word-length) and select the wireless channel on-the-fly. Since the environment is unknown and changes with time, we make the OML architecture reconfigurable to enable dynamic switch between various OML algorithms on-the-fly. We have demonstrated the functional correctness of the proposed architecture for different environments and word-lengths.

10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,IEEE,Journals,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

Moreover, no medical doctor or experts can manually keep pace today due to increasingly large and complex datasets. In this paper, the authors aim at addressing the mentioned issue by proposing a workflow of medical diagnosis through the lens of the machine learning perspective.

Software testing is probably the seminal example for usage of artificially created data. An appropriate data generator is suitable and necessary for almost every type of testing (including automated): the regression tests, null value tests, coverage, security and performance test. With the rise of data science, the data generation is as well used in machine learning, data mining, and data visualization. Other industries such as financial and health-care have great benefits from artificial data as well. Important aspect of the generated data is that the data needs to be realistic but not real, which embrace the confidentiality and privacy.

The automatic discovery of falls in real time with the ability to differentiate them from normal daily activities is crucial. To achieve this aim, this paper proposes an approach based on getting data through a tag placed on the subject's chest, a windowing of the data, the automatic extraction through the DEREx tool of a set of IF-THEN rules able to classify windows as being part of fall or non-fall actions, and a final window composition to assess whether or not each global action was a fall. The approach is then tested on a real-world database containing a set of fall and non-fall actions, and is compared, in terms of classification over windows, against four state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Moreover, its results are also compared, in terms of accuracy in discrimination of the fall actions from the non-fall ones, against those obtained by the database builders through the use of another powerful machine learning algorithm. Numerical results are encouraging, and suggest that the proposed methodology could put solid ground for the design and the implementation of a real-time system for fall detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8000169/,"2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)",16-18 May 2017,ieeexplore

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore

Analysis and mining of these big data in various real life problems from health care to disaster prevention is also becoming possible with the ever increasing computational power and maginificant growth of powerful machine learning algorithms. The dynamics of natural or man made disasters can be captured by time series data and their efficient analysis can lead to the development of effective systems to minimize the loss or damage. Efficient techniques and algorithms for time series analysis is a challenging problem. Traditional machine learning algorithms for analysis of static data cannot be directly applied for analyzing dynamic time series data. For analysis of time series, representation of data and the comparison method are very important. Various methods for representation and similarity measurement of time series data have been proposed. In this paper, a comparative study has been done by simulation experiments with 85 bench mark data sets as a first step to study the effect of representation of data for mining task. The main focus of this paper is to study the effect of classification with raw data using different similarity measures with traditional classifiers and convolutional neural network and transformed data in to recurrence plot, classified by convolutional neural network.

To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms.

10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244597,Online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm based human activity recognition using inertial data,IEEE,Conferences,"Human activity recognition (HAR) is the basis for many real world applications concerning health care, sports and gaming industry. Different methodological perspectives have been proposed to perform HAR. One appealing methodology is to take an advantage of data that are collected from inertial sensors which are embedded in the individual's smartphone. These data contain rich amount of information about daily activities of the user. However, there is no straightforward analytical mapping between a performed activity and its corresponding data. Besides, online training for the classification in these types of applications is a concern. This paper aims at classifying human activities based on the inertial data collected from a user's smartphone. An Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM) method is implemented to train a single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN).

10.1109/FPL.2016.7577311,Optimizing hardware design for Human Action Recognition,IEEE,Conferences,"Human action recognition (HAR) is an important topic in computer vision having a wide range of applications: health care, assisted living, surveillance, security, gaming, etc. Despite significant amount of work having been conducted in this area in recent years, the execution speed still limits real-time applications. Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the compute-intensive feature extraction stage done right at the output of the camera to extract and transfer only action feature in multi-camera network setting and hence reduce network bandwidth requirement. In this work, we first evaluate the possibility to perform feature extraction under reduced precision fixed-point arithmetic to ease hardware resource requirements. We compared the Histogram of Oriented Gradient in 3D (HOG3D) feature extraction with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods and shown the later to be 75× slower than the former. Our experiment shows that by re-training the classifier with reduced data precision, the classification performs as well as the original double-precision floating-point. Based on this result, we implement an FPGA-based HAR feature extraction for near camera processing using fixed-point data representation and arithmetic. This implementation, using a single Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA, achieves about 70× speedup over multicore CPU. Furthermore, a GPU implementation of HAR is introduced with 80× speedup over CPU (on an Nvidia Tesla K20). Last but not least, a power comparison is presented for the three platforms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7577311/,2016 26th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL),29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/ITECHA.2017.8101902,Personalized wearable systems for real-time ECG classification and healthcare interoperability: Real-time ECG classification and FHIR interoperability,IEEE,Conferences,"Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8101902/,2017 Internet Technologies and Applications (ITA),12-15 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

This work reports about application of some machine learning methods (linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, support-vector machine) for monitoring energy expenditures in athletes. The classification problem was to predict the known level of the in-exercise loads (in three categories by calories) by the heart rate activity features measured during the short period of time (1 minute only) after training, i.e by features of the post-exercise load. The results obtained shown that the post-exercise heart activity features preserve the information of the in-exercise training loads and allow us to predict their actual in-exercise levels. The best performance can be obtained by the random forest classifier with all 8 heart rate features (micro-averaged area under curve value AUC<sub>micro</sub> = 0.87 and macro-averaged one AUC<sub>macro</sub> = 0.88) and the k-nearest neighbors classifier with 4 most important heart rate features (AUC<sub>micro</sub> =0.91 and AUC<sub>macro</sub> =0.89).

Many complex health-care problems get suitable solutions with deep learning-based methods, especially for Medicine Combination Prediction (MCP) to patients with complex health conditions. However, existing works either ignore the inter-relationships among medicines or fail to depict these relationships in an integrated and robust deep learning framework. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose SeqMed, a sequence generation model for predicting medicine combination. With the power of Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), SeqMed can learn an expressive representation from medical records for the certain patient, and give accurate medicine recommendations for this patient. Experiments on real-world electronic medical record (EMR) dataset, MIMIC-III, show that SeqMed outperforms previous methods with a great leap. Meanwhile, SeqMed can stably converge.

A decrease in birthrate and an aging population have led to increased importance of health care for older adults. In such environments, a monitoring system is useful, in which a targeted person can be continuously viewed through a camera, and reports regarding the person's health can be automatically transmitted through email. However, the application does not take security into account enough because most systems are connected to the Internet. The system should be protected from a wide variety of risks to keep both personal data and sensors safe. Therefore, we developed SinkNet. This program connects several sensors and constructs a private network that can automatically perform a series of actions for client devices, such as collecting logs, detecting problems through machine learning, and checking to avoid and solve problems.

In the health care sector, enormous data are being generated on a daily basis, which contains different types of data, and acquiring knowledge from these data is essential. This knowledge can be acquired using various data mining techniques to mine knowledge by designing models from the medical records dataset. We implement a machine learning based system that can detect and predict heart diseases in patients using the medical records of patients. The proposed solution is based on existing techniques like Random Forest Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression, which provides a decision support system for medical professionals to detect and predict heart diseases and heart attacks in humans or individuals using risk factors of heart disease. The dataset used in our model consists of 18 features (risk factors) and 1990 observations after performing preprocessing. It was then split into 80% train sets and 20% test sets.

Big-data processing and AI algorithms are at the heart of autonomics research groups among industry and academia. Major advances in the field have traditionally focused on algorithmic research and increasing the performance of the developed algorithms. However, it has been recently recognized by the AI community that the applicability of these algorithms and their consideration in context is of paramount importance for their adoption. Current approaches to address AI in context lie in two areas: adaptive systems research that mainly focuses on implementing adaptivity mechanisms (technical perspective) and AI in context research that focuses on business aspects (business perspective). There is currently no approach that combines all aspects required from business considerations to an appropriate level of abstraction.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094354/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score.

Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services.

Generally speaking, Creativity can only be achieved by brains, which belong to human beings and other intelligent creatures. Machine creativity can rarely be presented. deep learning and reinforcement learning are regarded as having chances to achieve machine creativity and auto-processing. Trained agencies can process complicated real-time issues by being trained in the virtual environment facing with different states. Parameters of the agency are changed all the time until the model is under fitted. However, the creative decision could be achieved to some extent, novel ideas can rarely be output by machines. Therefore, based on the human creativity generation mechanism, loop destroying can break the thinking loop to produce novel ideas.

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients. The paper proposes a learning method to managing uncertainty in health data using rough set theory and other relevant attributes like location, time, age etc., which improves primary care to the patients of rural India. The patients belong to the positive region or lower approximation set of rough set are interpreted with certain symptoms while outcome about the patients in the boundary region is uncertain. The proposed method identifies the patients in the boundary region which could be interpreted positively based on specific criteria, defined using different attribute values.

The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

No study has, to the best of our knowledge, ever reported results comparing the effectiveness of several features for automatic emotion recognition. In this work, we present an extensive study conducted on feature selection for automatic, audio-visual, real-time, and person independent emotion recognition. More than 300,000 different neural networks have been trained in order to compare the performances of 64 features and 11 different sets of features with 450 different analysis settings. Results show that: 1) to build an optimal emotion recognition system, different emotions should be classified via different features and 2) different features, in general, require different processing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5518574/,2010 IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems,28-30 June 2010,ieeexplore

Situation awareness (SAW) is the capability of the entities in a service-based system to be aware of the situation changes and automatically adapt themselves to such changes to satisfy user requirements, including security and privacy. The continuing evolutions of the entities and environment makes SAW one of the most desired features to support dynamic adaptive computing in service-based systems. In this paper, the relationship between contexts/situations and services in situation-aware service-based systems is identified and an extension of OWL-S with situation ontology, called SAW-OWL-S, incorporates SAW in service specifications is presented.

However, a conversational agent for online sales may have a different feature than a conversational agent in other domain such as health care. The main task of a conversational agent in an online sales domain is to engage and persuade e-commerce customers to buy a product. In a real life, persuasion is considered as an abstract process, which only can be achieved through a series of dialogs. In a virtual world, a conversational agent for online sales is considered intelligent if it is able to demonstrate this feature.

Among many localization algorithms, range-free localization is more preferable because of its cost and implementation efficiency. Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms. Hence, simulation results clearly show that the performance of aforementioned method is better than other pioneer algorithms for such extended networks, and is insusceptible to the ratio of anchor nodes and network density.

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients. The paper proposes a learning method to managing uncertainty in health data using rough set theory and other relevant attributes like location, time, age etc., which improves primary care to the patients of rural India. The patients belong to the positive region or lower approximation set of rough set are interpreted with certain symptoms while outcome about the patients in the boundary region is uncertain. The proposed method identifies the patients in the boundary region which could be interpreted positively based on specific criteria, defined using different attribute values.

Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the compute-intensive feature extraction stage done right at the output of the camera to extract and transfer only action feature in multi-camera network setting and hence reduce network bandwidth requirement. In this work, we first evaluate the possibility to perform feature extraction under reduced precision fixed-point arithmetic to ease hardware resource requirements. We compared the Histogram of Oriented Gradient in 3D (HOG3D) feature extraction with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods and shown the later to be 75× slower than the former.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

This work reports about application of some machine learning methods (linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, support-vector machine) for monitoring energy expenditures in athletes. The classification problem was to predict the known level of the in-exercise loads (in three categories by calories) by the heart rate activity features measured during the short period of time (1 minute only) after training, i.e by features of the post-exercise load. The results obtained shown that the post-exercise heart activity features preserve the information of the in-exercise training loads and allow us to predict their actual in-exercise levels.

10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005488,Towards comparing and using Machine Learning techniques for detecting and predicting Heart Attack and Diseases,IEEE,Conferences,"Heart diseases are one of the deadly but are silent killers for humans, which results in the increase in death rate of sufferers every year. The World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2016, reported that 17.9 million deaths that occur worldwide per year are a result of heart disease. In the health care sector, enormous data are being generated on a daily basis, which contains different types of data, and acquiring knowledge from these data is essential. This knowledge can be acquired using various data mining techniques to mine knowledge by designing models from the medical records dataset. We implement a machine learning based system that can detect and predict heart diseases in patients using the medical records of patients. The proposed solution is based on existing techniques like Random Forest Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression, which provides a decision support system for medical professionals to detect and predict heart diseases and heart attacks in humans or individuals using risk factors of heart disease. The dataset used in our model consists of 18 features (risk factors) and 1990 observations after performing preprocessing. It was then split into 80% train sets and 20% test sets. Using real medical records of patients, a series of experiments were conducted to examine the performance and accuracy of the proposed system. The system was implemented in RStudio platform which predicts the risk of heart disease in patients. The compared results showed that the system performance and accuracy are acceptable with heart disease classification accuracy of 92.44% for Random Forest, 61.96%, and 59.7% for Naïve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005488/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Big-data processing and AI algorithms are at the heart of autonomics research groups among industry and academia. Major advances in the field have traditionally focused on algorithmic research and increasing the performance of the developed algorithms. However, it has been recently recognized by the AI community that the applicability of these algorithms and their consideration in context is of paramount importance for their adoption. Current approaches to address AI in context lie in two areas: adaptive systems research that mainly focuses on implementing adaptivity mechanisms (technical perspective) and AI in context research that focuses on business aspects (business perspective). There is currently no approach that combines all aspects required from business considerations to an appropriate level of abstraction. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of designing adaptive systems and therefore providing AI in context by utilising DSL technology.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094354/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

Briefly defined, such a smart home has special electronics to enable the remote control of automated devices specifically designed for remote health care to ensure the safety of the patient at home and the supervision of their health status. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit responsible for analyzing sensor data, detecting emergency situations, and interfacing between the patient at home and a set of people involved in their health care, such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, and paramedics. Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS. The proposed protocol adopts a fuzzy extractor for the identification of patients using the biometric data. The security of the proposed protocol is based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECCDHP) to preserve the privacy of the user.

Attempts at compliance, however, are hampered by lack of guidelines. Evaluation can be thought of as being subjectivist and objectivist. Subjectivist evaluation appears to be addressed in the literature and also some objectivist evaluation, but the core evaluation of performance accuracy appears to be the area that receives least attention in evaluation papers. It is hoped to rectify this, by concentrating on the methodology of formal quantitative evaluation and disseminating the information, allowing progression towards the production of guidelines for a sufficiency of performance evaluation.

A handheld probe with piezo electric crystals radiates a beam of ultrasonic sound waves in a thin plane, acoustic microphones detect the bounced sound wave and images of the underlying tissue structures are depicted on screen. The realtime advantage has led to ultrasound's alternative use as a guidance for medical treatments such as minimally invasive procedures.

10.1109/ICCAD45719.2019.8942124,Adar: Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent advances in machine learning and deep neural networks have led to the realization of many important applications in the area of personalized medicine. Whether it is detecting activities of daily living or analyzing images for cancerous cells, machine learning algorithms have become the dominant choice for such emerging applications. In particular, the state-of-the-art algorithms used for human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable inertial sensors utilize machine learning algorithms to detect health events and to make predictions from sensor data. Currently, however, there remains a gap in research on whether or not and how activity recognition algorithms may become the subject of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first strides on (1) investigating methods of generating adversarial example in the context of HAR systems; (2) studying the vulnerability of activity recognition models to adversarial examples in feature and signal domain; and (3) investigating the effects of adversarial training on HAR systems. We introduce Adar<sup>11</sup>Software code and experimental data for Adar are available online at https://github.com/rameshKrSah/Adar., a novel computational framework for optimization-driven creation of adversarial examples in sensor-based activity recognition systems. Through extensive analysis based on real sensor data collected with human subjects, we found that simple evasion attacks are able to decrease the accuracy of a deep neural network from 95.1% to 3.4% and from 93.1% to 16.8% in the case of a convolutional neural network. With adversarial training, the robustness of the deep neural network increased on the adversarial examples by 49.1% in the worst case while the accuracy on clean samples decreased by 13.2%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8942124/,2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD),4-7 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

All the proposed functional components are reusable, replaceable, and extensible for the system developers to implement customized home healthcare systems for different demands of patients and caregivers on healthcare monitoring aspects. The prototype design of the intelligent healthcare system based on these proposed components can provide the following features: 1). the system can monitor and record the videos of rehabilitation situations and actions of the patient by multiple CCD cameras, and the monitoring videos at different times can be accordingly stored in the archive. 2). the system can record the patient's physiological data records and the corresponding treatment plan, and these records can be stored in a XML archiving database for caregivers' review. 3). during the times for the patient to take medicine or other healing activities listed on the given treatment plan, the system can automatically alarm the patient and record the patient's treatment situations. 4). The patient's caregivers and family members can ubiquitously monitor the videos and physiological records of the patient's rehabilitation situations via the handheld mobile devices via the internet or wireless communication networks. 5).

However, in the real world, features of instances have much importance for classification. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient framework for MLTC called Hybrid Latent Dirichlet Allocation Multi-Label (HLDAML). To be specific, the topics of text features (i.e., a concrete description of documents) and the topics of label sets (i.e., a summarization of documents) can be obtained from training data by topic model before building models for multi-label classification. After that, hybrid topics can be used in existing approaches to improve the performance of MLTC. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is general and effective when taking text features and label sets into consideration simultaneously.

A walking human is a dynamic varying system and in spite of the VGRF reference dependence on several patient's variables, doctors traditionally use the same static reference for all patients. The purpose of this study is to find out if an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adequate to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profiles of healthy people depending on the subject's age, weight, height and stride duration. The ELM is compared with two other baseline Computational Intelligence (CI) methods, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and Multioutput Support Vector Regression (MSVR). Data from 28 healthy males walking at five different stride durations, collected using instrumented shoes, were used to train and test the CI models. The results showed that ELM is a well suited method to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profile for both dominant and non-dominant limbs, showing the lowest root mean square errors for the test set, 0.0201 and 0.0243 (fraction of body weight) for the dominant and non-dominant limbs respectively.

Specifically recurrent architectures based on long-short term memory (LSTM) cells have manifested excellent capability to model time dependencies in real-world data. However, standard recurrent architectures cannot estimate their uncertainty which is essential for safety-critical applications such as in medicine. In contrast, Bayesian recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to provide uncertainty estimation with improved accuracy. Nonetheless, Bayesian RNNs are computationally and memory demanding, which limits their practicality despite their advantages. To address this issue, we propose an FPGA-based hardware design to accelerate Bayesian LSTM-based RNNs. To further improve the overall algorithmic-hardware performance, a co-design framework is proposed to explore the most fitting algorithmic-hardware configurations for Bayesian RNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on healthcare applications to demonstrate the improvement of our design and the effectiveness of our framework.

Predictive analytics, despite being an information technology process, has been successfully adopted in various disciplines like medicine, but not so much in information technology itself. The aim of this research is to be able to use empirical predictive analytics as a security management tool within a fully virtualised information system. In order for us to achieve empirical predictive analytics in a virtualised environment, a combination of concepts, tools and techniques, ranging from monitoring, machine learning, situation awareness, regression and instance-based learning techniques, among others, will be used. A brief description of what predictive analytics is and how it can be adopted as a security management tool in virtualised cloud computing environments is highlighted in the chapters that follow. The paper also gives a brief description of the proposed framework, the aims and objectives of the research and the methodology that will be used to achieve the objectives of the project.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7563621/,2015 International Conference on Developments of E-Systems Engineering (DeSE),13-14 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore

TCM is widely used in China and is becoming increasingly available in Europe and North America. Besides, acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body. It is a key component of TCM. In our study, we focused on the virtual acupuncture training system, which is based on the Oculus virtual headset and gesture device - Leap Motion. However, the accuracy of gesture recognition is limited by the data collection from Leap Motion.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients.

Many complex health-care problems get suitable solutions with deep learning-based methods, especially for Medicine Combination Prediction (MCP) to patients with complex health conditions. However, existing works either ignore the inter-relationships among medicines or fail to depict these relationships in an integrated and robust deep learning framework. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose SeqMed, a sequence generation model for predicting medicine combination. With the power of Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), SeqMed can learn an expressive representation from medical records for the certain patient, and give accurate medicine recommendations for this patient. Experiments on real-world electronic medical record (EMR) dataset, MIMIC-III, show that SeqMed outperforms previous methods with a great leap. Meanwhile, SeqMed can stably converge.

This is an era of big data which is generated by different applications related to various fields like medicine, the World Wide Web, E-learning networking etc. So, we are still in need for more efficient algorithms which are computationally cost effective and thereby producing faster results. Sparse representation of data is one giant leap toward the search for a solution for big data analysis. The focus of our paper is on algorithms for sparsity-based representation of categorical data. For this, we adopt a concept from the image and signal processing domain called dictionary learning. We have successfully implemented its sparse coding stage which gives the sparse representation of data using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms (both Batch and Cholesky based) and its dictionary update stage using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We have also used a preprocessing stage where we represent the categorical dataset using a vector space model based on the TF-IDF weighting scheme. Our paper demonstrates how input data can be decomposed and approximated as a linear combination of minimum number of elementary columns of a dictionary which so formed will be a compact representation of data. Classification or clustering algorithms can now be easily performed based on the generated sparse coded coefficient matrix or based on the dictionary. We also give a comparison of the dictionary learning algorithm when applying different OMP algorithms.

Many research groups have shown impressive results on improving resolution in microscopy and quantitative phase retrieval by training DNNs on real datasets [1,2]. Recently, recovery and reconstruction of images after they have propagated through multimode optical fibers (MMFs) have also been achieved using DNNs [3,4]. When images propagate through MMFs they suffer severe scrambling because the information gets distributed among the different spatial modes that the fiber supports. Furthermore, since the fiber modes propagate with different velocities, the local information of the input decorrelates after a few millimeters along the MMF, thus resulting in the formation of a speckle pattern at the output. Recovery of information from such speckle patterns is of practical interest for integrating the MMFs for endoscopic applications in medicine or for signal recovery in telecommunications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8872523/,2019 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Europe & European Quantum Electronics Conference (CLEO/Europe-EQEC),23-27 June 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128607,AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Image segmentation was significantly enhanced after the emergence of deep learning (DL) methods. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a better accuracy in several evaluation metrics compared with the existing lightweight and efficient methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9617630/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, a new ANti-community detection algorithm based on the DEgree and the RATio between the Inner degree and the Outer degree of a Node (ANDERATION), is proposed, in which these two factors are firstly introduced to detect anti-community structure by first creating the initial anti-community structure and then maximizing the objective function.

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax.

To address these, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA).

In this work, a data driven controller is developed to control force and pose of a soft contact ultrasound sensor. The adaptive controller is based on a fuzzy-rules emulated network structure with the learning algorithm using a stochastic gradient approximation.

Currently, there is a plethora of computational algorithms on the web, which pertain to MCPs and provide all computational facilities required to solve a medical problem. An inherent requirement for the successful construction of algorithmic pathways for managing real medical cases is the composition of a sequence of computational algorithms.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873597,Hierarchical Semantic Mapping Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Intelligent Service Robotics,IEEE,Journals,"The introduction of service robots in the public domain has introduced a paradigm shift in how robots are interacting with people, where robots must learn to autonomously interact with the untrained public instead of being directed by trained personnel. As an example, a hospital service robot is told to deliver medicine to Patient Two in Ward Three. Without awareness of what “Patient Two” or “Ward Three” is, a service robot must systematically explore the environment to perform this task, which requires a long time. The implementation of a Semantic Map allows for robots to perceive the environment similar to people by associating semantic information with spatial information found in geometric maps. Currently, many semantic mapping works provide insufficient or incorrect semantic-metric information to allow a service robot to function dynamically in human-centric environments. This paper proposes a semantic map with a hierarchical semantic organization structure based on a hybrid metric-topological map leveraging convolutional neural networks and spatial room segmentation methods. Our results are validated using multiple simulated and real environments on our lab's custom developed mobile service robot and demonstrate an application of semantic maps by providing only vocal commands. We show that this proposed method provides better capabilities in terms of semantic map labeling and retain multiple levels of semantic information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490234/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/JBHI.2020.3008493,Medical Treatment Migration Prediction Based on GCN via Medical Insurance Data,IEEE,Journals,"Nowadays, prediction for medical treatment migration has become one of the interesting issues in the field of health informatics. This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set. Experimental results show that our model's predictive ability is better than the best models available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9138732/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

Among community detection methods, label propagation technology is widely used because of its linear time complexity. However, due to the randomness of the node order of label updating and the order of label launching in label propagation, the instability of community detection approaches based on label propagation becomes a challenge. In this paper, a new label propagation algorithm, Node Ability based Label Propagation Algorithm (NALPA), is proposed to discover communities in networks. Inspired from human society and radar transmission, we design four node abilities (propagation ability, attraction ability, launch ability and acceptance ability), label influence and a new label propagation mechanism to deal with the instability and enhance the efficiency. Experimental results on 42 synthetic and 14 real-world networks demonstrate that NALPA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in most cases. In a case study, NALPA is applied to a drug network in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and can discover the drug communities where drugs have similar efficacy for treating Chronic GlomeruloNephritis (CGN).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9020154/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Methods: The risk scoring system is based on the idea of sequential hypothesis testing under an uncertain time horizon. The system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g., age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results: Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6321 patients admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our score significantly outperforms the currently deployed risk scores, such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE, and SOFA scores, in terms of timeliness, true positive rate, and positive predictive value. Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients' heterogeneity. Significance: The proposed risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical and social benefits on a massive number of critically ill inpatients who exhibit adverse outcomes including, but not limited to, cardiac arrests, respiratory arrests, and septic shocks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7913647/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,Jan. 2018,ieeexplore

Examples include environmental pollution borderline detection, oil basin edge characterization, or discrimination between cancerous and healthy tissue in medicine. We present a method for producing visualizations of surfaces with uncertainties using points as display primitives. Our approach is to render the surface as a collection of points and to displace each point from its original location along the surface normal by an amount proportional to the uncertainty at that point. This approach can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudocoloring to produce efficient and revealing visualizations. The basic approach is sufficiently flexible to allow natural extensions; we show incorporation of expressive modulation of opacity, change of the stroke primitive, and addition of an underlying polygonal model.

Briefly defined, such a smart home has special electronics to enable the remote control of automated devices specifically designed for remote health care to ensure the safety of the patient at home and the supervision of their health status. These sensors are linked to a local intelligence unit responsible for analyzing sensor data, detecting emergency situations, and interfacing between the patient at home and a set of people involved in their health care, such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, and paramedics. Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS. The proposed protocol adopts a fuzzy extractor for the identification of patients using the biometric data. The security of the proposed protocol is based on the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECCDHP) to preserve the privacy of the user.

10.1109/4233.735786,Real-time separation of discontinuous adventitious sounds from vesicular sounds using a fuzzy rule-based filter,IEEE,Journals,"The separation of pathological discontinuous adventitious sounds (DAS) from vesicular sounds (VS) is of great importance to the analysis of lung sounds since DAS are related to certain pulmonary pathologies. An automated way of revealing the diagnostic character of DAS, by isolating them from VS, based on their nonstationarity, is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems to compose a generalized fuzzy rule-based stationary-nonstationary filter (GFST-NST). The training procedure of the fuzzy inference systems involves the outputs of the wavelet transform-based stationary-nonstationary filter (WTST-NST), proposed by Hadjileontiadis and Panas (1997). The basic idea of the GFST-NST was initially proposed by the authors with the introduction of the fuzzy rule-based stationary-nonstationary filter (FST-NST) (1997), tested with the separation of crackles from VS. The main contribution of this paper is the modification of the structure of the FST-NST filter to a serial-type fuzzy filter that, unlike the parallel operation of the FST-NST filter, sends a predicted stationary signal (VS) into the predictor of the nonstationary (DAS). Applying the GFST-NST filter to fine-coarse crackles and squawks, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of DAS is revealed and they are separated from VS. The separation performance of the GFST-NST filter was evaluated through quantitative and qualitative indexes that proved its efficiency and superiority against the FST-NST filter. When compared to the WTST-NST filter, the GFST-NST filter performed similarly in accuracy and objectiveness, but in a faster way. Thus, the GFST-NST filter combines the separation accuracy of the WTST-NST filter with the real-time implementation of the FST-NST filter, so it can easily be used in clinical medicine as a module of an integrated intelligent patient evaluation system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/735786/,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,Sept. 1998,ieeexplore
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines.

It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets.

Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained, heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors. Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis. Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS. In this regard, we propose a machine learning based security algorithm run as an application at the fog node using a binarized multi-factor boosted ensemble learner algorithm coupled with feature selection.

Incremental learning proves to be time as well as resource-efficient solution for deployment of deep learning algorithms in real world as the model can automatically and dynamically adapt to new data as and when annotated data becomes available. The development and deployment of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools in medical domain is another scenario, where incremental learning becomes very crucial as collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset spanning over multiple pathologies and imaging machines might take years.

A physician's interview based method is described to define a orthogonal fuzzy symptom information system, required to apply the model. For the purpose of elaboration and elicitation of characteristics, the algorithm is applied to a simple simulated dataset, and compared with conventional naive Bayes (NB) approach. As a preliminary evaluation of FNB in real world scenario, the comparison is repeated on a real fuzzy dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. The case study on simulated dataset elucidates that FNB can be optimal over NB for diagnosing patients with imprecise-fuzzy information, on account of the following characteristics - 1) it can model the information that, values of some attributes are semantically closer than values of other attributes, and 2) it offers a mechanism to temper exaggerations in patient information. Although the algorithm requires precise training data, its utility for fuzzy training data is argued for.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based medical auxiliary diagnosis system, the impact of label noise problems is also increasing. When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, due to ambiguous patient conditions or poor reliability of diagnostic criteria, even clinical experts may lack confidence in making medical diagnoses for some patients. As a result, some samples used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, which adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we study a classification problem of sample labels with random damage. We propose a new hybrid label noise correction model that generalizes many learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. This hybrid model can withstand the negative effects of random noise and various non-random label noise.

As computers and communication bandwidth become ever faster and cheaper, computing and communication capabilities are embedded in all types of objects and structures in the physical environment. Harnessing these capabilities to bridge the cyber-world with the physical world will allow the development of applications with great societal impact and economic benefit. At the heart of these applications are cyber-physical systems consisting of integrated computational and communication cores that interact with the physical world, with intelligence provided by embedded software. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are engineered systems that provide tight integration of and coordination between the cyber world of computing and communications and the physical world. CPS are to meet the needs of the new generation of engineered systems that are highly dependable, efficiently produced and certified, and capable of advanced performance in computation, communication, and control. CPS will transform how we interact with and control the physical world around us, as the Internet transformed how we interact and communicate with one another and revolutionized how and where we access information. One application domain of CPS is Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), which are life-critical, context-aware, networked systems of medical devices. Medical device industry is undergoing a transformation, embracing the potential of embedded software and network connectivity. Instead of stand-alone devices that can be designed, certified, and used to treat patients independent of each other, distributed systems that simultaneously control multiple aspects of the patient's physiology are increasingly used in hospitals to provide high-quality continuous care for patients.

10.1109/CRV.2017.15,Leveraging Tree Statistics for Extracting Anatomical Trees from 3D Medical Images,IEEE,Conferences,"Using different priors (e.g. shape and appearance) have proven critical for robust image segmentation of different types of target objects. Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images. Through a minimax two-player game, the generative and discriminative networks can train each other. The generated synthetic images are used to train a CNN classification model for tissue recognition.

For solving of current problems in defined area the method of inductive formation of easily interpretable medical diagnostic knowledge bases is suggested. It includes the new definitions of classification and clustering problems for dependence models with parameters and the learning algorithm (solving mentioned problems in their new definitions) developed for the practically useful and easily interpretable mathematical dependence model with parameters which is a near real-life ontology of medical diagnostics (defined by a system of logical relationships with parameters).

The first stage is a self-organizing principal components analysis (SOPCA) network that is used to project the feature vector onto its leading principal axes found by using principal components analysis. This step provides an effective basis for feature extraction. The second stage consists of a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) which will automatically cluster the input vector into different regions. The optimum number of regions (clusters) is obtained by a model fitting approach. Finally, a 3D connected component labeling algorithm is applied to ensure region connectivity.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128607,AEDCN-Net: Accurate and Efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model for Medical Image Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Image segmentation was significantly enhanced after the emergence of deep learning (DL) methods. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference. Moreover, the proposed method obtains a better accuracy in several evaluation metrics compared with the existing lightweight and efficient methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9617630/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Due to the large amount of data to be transmitted in the reconstructed model and the small storage capacity, data need to be compressed progressively before transmission. On this basis, we proposed a lightweight progressive transmission algorithm based on large data visualization in telemedicine to improve transmission efficiency and achieve lossless transmission of original data. Moreover, a novel four-layer system architecture based on IoT has been introduced, including the sensing layer, analysis layer, network layer and application layer.

Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019.

However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required.

To address this, this study identifies the diagnostic strategy learning problem and proposes a novel framework consisting of three components to learn a diagnostic strategy with limited features. First, as we often encounter incomplete medical records of the patients, a sequence encoder is designed to encode any set of information in various sizes into fixed-length vectors. Second, taking the output of the encoder as the input, a feature selector based on reinforcement learning techniques is proposed to learn the best feature sequence for diagnosis.

In this paper, we propose two label selection methods for multi-label classification: clustering-based sampling and frequency-based sampling. We apply our proposed multi-label classification methods as an innovative 5G application to predict doctor labels for doctor recommendations. We perform experiments on real-world data sets. The experimental results show that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance compared with baselines. In addition, we develop a mobile application of a doctor recommendation system based on our proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487004/,IEEE Access,2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019577,Patient Similarity via Joint Embeddings of Medical Knowledge Graph and Medical Entity Descriptions,IEEE,Journals,"With the prevalence and growing volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), there has been increasing interest in mining EHRs for improving clinical decision support. The accurate identification of patients with similar conditions based on EHRs is a key step in personalized healthcare. Existing studies model EHRs by medical knowledge graph embedding to learn the latent embeddings of medical entities (e.g., patients, medications, diagnoses and procedures). However, such precisely structured data is usually limited in quantity and in scope. Therefore, to enhance the quality of the embeddings it is important to consider more widely available medical information such as medical entity descriptions. In this paper we propose a novel framework, called Deep Patient Similarity (DeepPS). Specifically, DeepPS incorporates medical entity descriptions by augmenting the embeddings of medical entities and relations with the embeddings of words, which leverages both information from medical knowledge graph structures and the contexts of medical entity descriptions. Furthermore, DeepPS employs the embeddings to patient similarity learning by leveraging Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP). Extensive experiments on real datasets are conducted to show superior performance of our proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9178312/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems. It is conjectured that, potentially, the method could be extended to determine risks associated with the deployment of intelligent medical systems in clinical practice.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/846690/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,July 2000,ieeexplore
10.1109/TLT.2020.2995163,The Human Muscular Arm Avatar as an Interactive Visualization Tool in Learning Anatomy: Medical Students’ Perspectives,IEEE,Journals,"The perception of body ownership creates a sense of embodiment, which can be a powerful learning tool. Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data. HMAA is believed to have allowed individuals to visualize and conceptualize abstract ideas that would have been otherwise challenging using static models. The outcomes of this article indicate the significant potential of body-ownership-based self-learning tools for anatomy. However, further studies using learning outcomes are needed to investigate the potential advantages of body-ownership-based tools compared to current learning techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9095361/,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,1 July-Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

In this study we investigated the feasibility of generating real-time 3D (i.e., 4D) SHI volumes. Four-dimensional SHI (f<sub>0</sub> = 5.8 MHz, transmitting 4 cycle pulses) was implemented on a Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner with a mechanically controlled 4D10L probe (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Experimental software provided access to both individual slice data and rendered images. This software also allowed imaging in B-mode (at 10 MHz) and harmonic imaging (HI; f<sub>0</sub> = 5 MHz, f<sub>receive</sub>= 10 MHz). Two canines received 5 μl/kg bolus injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) for HI and 20 μl/kg bolus for SHI of the lower renal pole. The contrast-to-tissue ratio was then calculated for three injections in each canine and compared between modes. Patients scheduled for biopsy of a mammographically identified breast lesion provided informed consent. Baseline scanning was performed in both B-mode and power Doppler. Patients then received a 0.25 ml bolus of Definity for HI followed by a bolus injection of 20 μl/kg for SHI. Baseline 2D cine loops, 3D slice data and rendered volumes were saved for off-line comparison. While scan volumes varied, a volume of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm acquired at a 19° volume angle resulted in 45-50 slices per volume at an acquisition rate of 1.8 to 2.2 Hz depending on depth. In the canine model, SHI resulted in significant improvement in contrast visualization and rendered SHI images demonstrated superior tissue suppression and a greater overall view of renal vasculature. In breast lesions, enhancement varied greatly on a case by case basis. However, SHI resulted in improved tissue suppression and detection of contrast in almost all cases.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

Current solutions include the brute-force approach (try as many techniques as possible), and the random search approach (choose the most appropriate from a random subset of techniques). In this work, we propose a new method to select sampling techniques for imbalanced data sets. It uses Meta-Learning and works by recommending a technique for an imbalanced data set based on solutions to previous problems. Our experimentation compared the proposed method against the brute-force approach, all techniques with their default parameters, and the random search approach. The results of our experimentation show that the proposed method is comparable to the brute-force approach, outperforms the techniques with their default parameters most of the time, and always surpasses the random search approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7839617/,2016 5th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS),9-12 Oct. 2016,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482045,A Novel Feature Selection Based Classification Algorithm for Real-Time Medical Disease Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"In the current medical databases, feature extraction and disease prediction are the essential requirements to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Alzheimer's diseases. Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection based classification algorithm is better than the traditional algorithms in terms of true positive rate, error rate and F-measure are concerned.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8482045/,2018 IEEE 17th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),16-18 July 2018,ieeexplore

Such fractures take a lot of time to heal even after a surgery is performed. In addition to this, the majority of such injuries prove to be fatal due to the lack of quick communication and immediate medical response. This situation is pretty common in today's world where the elderly are most of the time unattended at home. Owing to this need, we have designed a system to detect such falls leveraging machine learning and signal processing algorithms deployed over a simple 32-bit micro-controller. To achieve higher accuracy, we prepared our custom dataset of various types of fall as well as other daily routine activities. Our device informs the close relatives/family via a GSM Module when a fall is detected. The main purpose of our system is to detect a fall and trigger the alert system and take immediate action to minimize the impact of the fall.

Arrhythmia is a type of heart ailment where the heart rate is irregular. It is caused due to erratic behavior of the electrical impulses that control the heartbeat. Detection and classification of arrhythmia are conventionally done manually by expert cardiologists through meticulous analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. Automatic and real-time ECG detection and analysis has gained importance in recent years especially due to the accelerating pace of advances in medical technologies. Therefore, the proposed system takes in data from an ECG sensor module (AD8232) and provides it as input to a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in real-time. This model is capable of detecting various types of arrhythmias with accuracy greater than 90%. The classification results are then presented to the user through an interactive mobile application.

The algorithms that were investigated for this paper are based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), measures of variance, linear predictive coding, and measurement of approximate entropy (AE). Based on the results from the test data set, the HMM algorithm performed best for this application. In general, there is little difference between the performance of the HMM and AE algorithms. However, the implementation of the HMM algorithm is more computationally efficient. Because of the large amount of data that must be analyzed in ambulatory ECG recordings, the computational efficiency must be considered as an issue of practicality. Review of the data illuminated some of the strengths and weaknesses of the various algorithms. Variance measures performed with either high sensitivity or high positive predictivity, but were not able to achieve a desirable operating point that had both acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity. Although AE and LPC had acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity, the HMM performed even better than both of these in terms of overall error rate. It would seem that an observational model such as the HMM, fits the data better than parametric models such as AE and LPC.

Human gesture used for Man-Machine Interaction became attractive as it offers a simpler way of controlling sophisticated devices, in a sci-fi-like scenario, in return of an increasingly computational power required by the artificial intelligence algorithms needed to detect, track and recognize them. There have been attempts to bring a solution to it by using 2D or 3D based image processing methods. There is a clear balance incline towards 3D methods in the consumer product as besides the almost insurmountable difficulties for producing robust and stable results, the price constraint added supplementary hurdles. As perfect illumination conditions are core factors in obtaining the above results, the infrared light was unanimously adopted by the domain technologies. In this paper, a novel real-time depth-mapping principle and a corresponding hardware solution for an IR depth-mapping camera is introduced. The new IR camera architecture comprises an illuminator module which is pulsed and modulated via a monotonic function using a phase-locked loop control for the laser intensity, while the reflected infrared light is captured during the increasing and decreasing monotonic function.

10.1109/ICPCSI.2017.8392290,A review of image processing leading to artificial intelligence methods to detect instruments in ultrasound guided minimally invasive surgical procedures,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound is a medical diagnostic imaging modality with the ability to visualize the underlying tissues and organs in the body in realtime. A handheld probe with piezo electric crystals radiates a beam of ultrasonic sound waves in a thin plane, acoustic microphones detect the bounced sound wave and images of the underlying tissue structures are depicted on screen. The realtime advantage has led to ultrasound's alternative use as a guidance for medical treatments such as minimally invasive procedures. Minimally Invasive Surgical procedures require skillful interpretation of the ultrasound image to distinguish the location of the instrument, it's motion and maneuver it via different tissue regions to reach a specified target.

10.1109/ICEESA.2013.6578451,A supervised segmentation scheme based on multilayer neural network and color active contour model for breast cancer nuclei detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Breast cancer nuclei detection is an impressive challenge in surgeries and medical treatments. In the microscopic image of immunohistologically stained breast tissue, cancer nuclei present a large variety in their characteristics that bring various difficulties for traditional segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient supervised segmentation method using a multilayer neural network (MNN) combined with a modified geometric active contour model based on Bayes error energy functional for nuclear stained breast tissue images. First, a discrimination function is constructed from color information of the desired nuclei using Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) analysis and a trained MNN in order to get a preliminary classification of cancer nuclei. This function is then included in the region term of the energy functional and the stopping function of the model to improve the segmentation accuracy of the detected cancer nuclei. Furthermore, the initial curve and the controlling parameters of the proposed model are estimated directly from the initial segmentation by the FLD-MNN method. The proposed segmentation scheme is tested on different microscopic breast tissue images recorded from real patients located in the Tunisian Salah Azaiez Cancer Center.

Text detection, especially for indistinct, diverse, multi-language text regions, is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision and has attracted increasing attention recently. Moreover, although there are some studies in data mining related to structured data extraction, it has not received its deserved attention as one of important steps in OCR. The previous methods for structural data extraction, including layout template-based, rule-based, and natural language processing (NLP)-based methods, usually leads to either inaccurate results or complex modules.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4). Our investigation and observations indicate major improvements to predict unusual traffic accident event even after model compression and deployment.

Our approach is based on two basic operators employed to connect new databases to the system: mapping and unification. The mapping process produces what is called the ""virtual conceptual schema"" of the newly created VR while the unification process provides tools to create an integrated virtual schema for at least two pre-existing VRs. We tested the current implementation of ARMEDA Il using two tumor databases, one containing information from a hospital and the other containing genetic data associated to the tumor samples.

As the complexity of the learning tasks increases, the DL models become deeper or wider with millions of parameters and use larger datasets. Neural networks like AmoebaNet with 557M parameters and GPT-2 with 1.5 billion parameters are some of the recent examples of large models. DL trainings are generally run on accelerated hardware such as GPUs, TPUs or FPGAs which can satisfy the high computational demands of the neural network training. But accelerators are limited in their memory capacities. Larger the models, larger the memory required while training them. Hence, large DL models and large datasets cannot fit into the limited memory available on GPUs. However, there are techniques designed to overcome this limitation like compression, using CPU memory as a data swap, recomputations within the GPUs etc. But the efficiency of each of these techniques also depends on the underneath system platform capabilities. In this paper we present the observations from our study of training large DL models using data swap method on different system platforms. This study showcases the characteristics of large models and presents the system viewpoint of large deep learning model training by studying the relation of the software techniques to the system platform used underneath.

The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain.

In order to overcome these problems and construct an efficient classifier, for these real situations in medical fields, in this work we present an approach based on the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), which utilizes a transfer learning framework to make maximum use of the data and guarantee its enhanced generalization capability. The proposed approach is capable of effectively learning a target domain with limited samples by relying on the probabilistic outputs from the other previously learned model using a heterogeneous method in the source domain. Moreover, it autonomously and quickly decides how much output knowledge to transfer from source domain to the target one using a fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy.

One critical skill requiring subjective (qualitative) learning involves navigating through varying soft and hard tissues by hand, and, most importantly, understanding how medical instruments respond under these conditions. During residency, students learn the specific methods of the teaching surgeons, using specific instruments chosen by both the administrators of the residency programs and medical staff. The availability of practice time is limited not by the interest of the resident, but due to limitations in resources (e.g. high cost of cadaver parts, program insurance, and available contact time with patients in the operating room). By using data extraction during training, teaching surgeons can determine how well participants learn a subjective skill. Without data extraction, residents lack quantifiable numbers to guide them. Such values would verify correct techniques and highlight areas for improvement. In the end, the effectiveness of surgical training, mastery of soft skills, and overall surgical experience directly helps or harms patient outcomes [1].

In the field of medical domain, the extraction of features from real-time images of cancer CT has becoming challenging. The incorporation of machine learning in medical data could explore the salient features that could be used for exploring patterns which then aids in decision making process.Motivation The realm of determining the accuracy of the observed medical image serves as an important factor in accessing image quality and recognition. The quality of image acquisition and analysis lies at quality factors such as range, sharpness, color, fare of lens, artifacts, and tone reproduction. The mechanism of automatic prediction is being useful for a number of practical applications, but if there is a systematic means of accessing the sections of poor quality of subsequent images in medical informatics it can be helpful for assessment and evaluation to determine flags and noise thereby rendering quality-based fusion on all observed images.Objective The objective is to validate the accuracy of cancer CT images using machine learning techniques. The assessment is made in accordance with the deployment of Convolution Neural Network with the enhancement in the image quality features.Methodology The process of assessment and evaluation involves training the dataset with proposed quality metrics.

Various forms of bio-modalities, such as the face, iris, fingerprint, are commonly used for secure user authentication. Concurrently, various spoofing approaches have also been developed over time which can fail traditional bio-modality detection systems. Image synthesis with play-doh, gelatin, ecoflex etc. are some of the ways used in spoofing bio-identifiable property. Since the bio-modality detection sensors are small and resource constrained, heavy-weight detection mechanisms are not suitable for these sensors. Recently, Fog based architectures are proposed to support sensor management in the Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). A thin software client running in these resource-constrained sensors can enable communication with fog nodes for better management and analysis. Therefore, we propose a fog-based security application to detect bio-modality spoofing in a Fog based MCPS.

Deep learning has been proven to achieve state-of-the-art performance in BG prediction.

In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning framework to predict BG levels with the edge inference on a microcontroller unit embedded in a low- power system. By using glucose measurements from a CGM sensor and a recurrent neural network that builds on long-short term memory, the personalized models achieves state-of-the-art performance on a clinical data set obtained from 12 subjects with T1D. In particular, the proposed method achieves an average root mean square error of 19.10 ± 2.04 for a 30-minute prediction horizon (PH) and 32.61 ± 3.45 for a 60-minute PH with high clinical accuracy. Notably, the framework has been optimized to achieve a minimum use of hardware resources (34KB FLASH and 1KB SRAM) as well as an execution time of 22 ms for low power operations (8 μW).

However, current diagnosis depends on dozens of factors, including the family member, past medical problems, tests of memory, blood and urine tests, brain scans and even cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Among them, regular features (e.g., blood and urine tests, brain scans) are simple and accurate. Privileged features (e.g., tests of memory, cerebrospinal fluid specimens) are inconvenient and uncomfortable to acquire, and thus incomplete in most cases. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to predict merely using the regular feature with the aid of incomplete privileged data in the training time. In particular, we first complement the missing data of privileged features by exploring the relationship with regular features and labels. The recovered privileged features, regular features, as well as labels, are combined as a new set of privileged features.

10.1109/ICASERT.2019.8934561,Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Brain Tumor segmentation is one of the most crucial and arduous tasks in the terrain of medical image processing as a human-assisted manual classification can result in inaccurate prediction and diagnosis. Moreover, it is an aggravating task when there is a large amount of data present to be assisted. Brain tumors have high diversity in appearance and there is a similarity between tumor and normal tissues and thus the extraction of tumor regions from images becomes unyielding. In this paper, we proposed a method to extract brain tumor from 2D Magnetic Resonance brain Images (MRI) by Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm which was followed by traditional classifiers and convolutional neural network. The experimental study was carried on a real-time dataset with diverse tumor sizes, locations, shapes, and different image intensities. In traditional classifier part, we applied six traditional classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest which was implemented in scikit-learn. Afterward, we moved on to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is implemented using Keras and Tensorflow because it yields to a better performance than the traditional ones. In our work, CNN gained an accuracy of 97.87%, which is very compelling. The main aim of this paper is to distinguish between normal and abnormal pixels, based on texture based and statistical based features.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8934561/,"2019 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT)",3-5 May 2019,ieeexplore

However, the focus of XR research has shown a lack of diversity in solutions to the problems within medicine, with it being predominantly focused in augmenting surgical procedures. Whilst important, XR applied to aiding medical diagnosis and surgical planning is relatively unexplored. In this paper we present a fully functional mammographic image analysis system, Breast3D, that can reconstruct MRI and CT scan data in XR. With breast cancer Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) risk lexicon, early detection and clinical workflow such as Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings for cancer in mind, our new mammography visualization system reconstructs CT and MRI volumes in a real 3D space. Breast3D is built upon the past literature and inspired from research for diagnosis and surgical planning. In addition to visualising the models in MR using the Microsoft HoloLens, Breast3D is versatile and portable to different XR head-mounted displays such as HTC Vive.

10.1109/ICCCS49078.2020.9118497,CT Image Super Resolution Based On Improved SRGAN,IEEE,Conferences,"CT images are commonly used in medical clinical diagnosis. However, due to factors such as hardware and scanning time, CT images in real scenes are limited by spatial resolution so that doctors cannot perform accurate disease analysis on tiny lesion areas and pathological features. An image super-resolution (SR) method based on deep learning is a good way to solve this problem. Although many excellent networks have been proposed, but they all pay more attention to image quality indicators than image visual perception quality. Unlike other networks that focus more on image evaluation metrics, the super resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) has achieved tremendous improvements in image perception quality. Based on the above, this paper proposes a CT image super-resolution algorithm based on improved SRGAN. In order to improve the visual quality of CT images, a dilated convolution module is introduced. At the same time, in order to improve the overall visual effect of the image, the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) loss is also introduced to improve the perceptual loss function. Experimental results on the public CT image dataset demonstrate that our model is better than the baseline method SRGAN not only in mean opinion score(MOS), but also in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) values.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9118497/,2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS),15-18 May 2020,ieeexplore

Easy access to massive data sets, data analytics tools and High-Performance Computing (HPC) have been fueling this revolution. In many ways, cognification is similar to the electrification revolution that took place more than a century ago when electricity became a ubiquitous commodity that could be accessed with ease from anywhere in order to transform mechanical processes into their electrical counterparts. In this paper, we consider two particular forms of distributed computing - Data Centers and HPC systems - and argue that they are ripe for cognification of their entire ecosystem, ranging from top-level applications down to low-level resource and power management services. We present our vision for what ""Cognified Distributed Computing"" might look like and outline some of the challenges that need to be addressed and new technologies that need to be developed in order to make it a reality. In particular, we examine the role cognification can play in tackling power consumption, resiliency and management problems in these systems. We describe intelligent software-based solutions to these problems powered by on-line predictive models built from streamed real-time data. While we cast the problem and our solutions in the context of large Data Centers and HPC systems, we believe our approach to be applicable to distributed computing in general.

10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320014,CrossMine: efficient classification across multiple database relations,IEEE,Conferences,"Most of today's structured data is stored in relational databases. Such a database consists of multiple relations which are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship links in the design of relational database schemas. Multirelational classification can be widely used in many disciplines, such as financial decision-making, medical research, and geographical applications. However, most classification approaches only work on single ""flat"" data relations. It is usually difficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge, undesirable ""universal relation"" or losing essential information. Previous works using inductive logic programming approaches (recently also known as relational mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately, they suffer from poor scalability w.r.t. the number of relations and the number of attributes in databases. We propose CrossMine, an efficient and scalable approach for multirelational classification. Several novel methods are developed in CrossMine, including (1) tuple ID propagation, which performs semantics-preserving virtual join to achieve high efficiency on databases with complex schemas, and (2) a selective sampling method, which makes it highly scalable w.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases. Both theoretical backgrounds and implementation techniques of CrossMine are introduced.

10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00141,DEAL: Deep Evidential Active Learning for Image Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be state-of-the-art models for image classification. However, large labeled data sets are generally needed for the training and validation of such models. In many domains, unlabeled data is available but labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required. Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled data. Through selecting the most informative and representative data instances for labeling, AL can contribute to more efficient learning of a model. Recent AL methods for CNNs propose different solutions for the selection of such instances. However, they do not perform consistently well and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel AL algorithm that efficiently learns from unlabeled data by capturing high prediction uncertainty. By replacing the softmax standard output of a CNN with the parameters of a Dirichlet density, the model learns to identify data instances that contribute efficiently to improving model performance during training. We demonstrate in several experiments with publicly available data that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art AL approaches. It can be easily implemented and does not require extensive computational resources for training. Additionally, we are able to show the benefits of the approach on the real-world medical use case of pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images.

However, GANs suffer from the problem of mode collapse in the training process then generate images with a limited variety. On the other hand, variational auto-encoder (VAE) is free from mode collapse but it generates blurred images. In this work, we study an auto-encoding generative adversarial network combining the advantages of GAN and VAE to generate realistic images for medical thyroid ultrasound image augmentation.

We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias.

10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115841,Designing device independent two-phase activity recognition framework for smartphones,IEEE,Conferences,"Human activity recognition through posture identification is increasingly used for medical, surveillance and entertainment applications. This paper proposes a ubiquitous solution to activity recognition through the use of tri-axial accelerometers of smartphones. Use of smartphones for activity recognition poses new challenges such as variation in hardware configuration and usage behavior like where the smartphone is kept. Only a few works address one or more of these challenges. Consequently, in this paper we present an activity recognition framework for identifying both static and dynamic activities addressing above mentioned challenges in order to make the framework ubiquitous. Since accelerometer is widely available in many smartphone configurations, activities are detected based on accelerometer readings only.

10.1109/EAIT.2018.8470425,Detailed Activity Recognition with Smartphones,IEEE,Conferences,"Sensors embedded in smart handheld can be ex-tremely useful in providing information on people's activities and behaviors. Human exact activity recognition through pos- ture identification is increasingly used for medical, surveillance. Existing works mostly uses one or more specific devices (with embedded sensor) for activity recognition and most of the time the detected activities are coarse grained like sit or walk rather than detailed like sit on chair or brisk walk. Consequently, in this paper we propose a detailed activity recognition system that uses smartphone accelerometer (available in almost every smartphone) thus does not need any special device to be carried by the user. The system applies inexpensive (in terms of resources consumed) feature extraction and learning mechanism to detect detailed activities, for instance, stow walk and brisk walk. We introduce a new feature based on jerk to detect both detailed static activities (sit on chair) and detailed dynamic activities (brisk walk).

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

10.1109/NSS/MIC42677.2020.9508035,Estimating Ensemble Bias using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are powerful tools in many medical imaging applications including denoising. However, a major concern in deploying a CNN in safety-critical areas is to access its prediction accuracy on out-of-distribution test samples. Our previous study showed that while a CNN could generate similar ensemble standard deviation levels on inputs with different noise levels, the magnitude and location of bias could be substantially different. These observations imply that although CNNs can generate visually high-quality images from each individual dataset, the bias might be higher in one image than the other, which might lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial for us to understand when and where a CNN is uncertain about its prediction in real clinical datasets. In this study, we investigate the use of a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) to estimate an uncertainty map of its prediction, and assess its correlations with the ensemble bias of its own and a conventional CNN's prediction ensemble bias, respectively. The BCNN is implemented by adding Monte Carlo dropout layers after each convolution and ReLU layer, which is equivalent to imposing a Bernoulli prior distribution on the network weights. At the testing stage, we acquire multiple stochastic forward passes through the network to generate the uncertainty map. We applied BCNN and CNN on two 18F-FDG scans, with one whole-body scan which is considered as an in-distribution test sample, and one brain only study which is considered as an out-of-distribution sample. For the whole-body scan, we generated 10 noise realizations for ensemble analysis using bootstrap. Our results demonstrate that BCNN can generate a prediction uncertainty map that highly correlates with the ensemble bias map. This technique could provide important guidance on interpreting the denoising results from a neural network where ground truth is unknown.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9508035/,2020 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC),31 Oct.-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data.

However, not much has so far been explored in this direction. In the current work, we propose a robust and efficient method for incremental learning in medical imaging domain.

Each year, close to 30% of adults around the age group of 65 fall down at least once. In the year 2015, close to 2.9 million falls were reported, resulting in 33,000 deaths. As much as 61% of elderly nursing home residents fell at some point during their first year of residence. These falls may aggravate the situation leading to bone fracture, concussion, internal bleeding or traumatic brain injury when immediate medical attention is not offered to the person. Delay in course of the event may sometimes lead to death as well. Recently, many studies have come up with wearable devices. These devices that are now commercially available in the market are small, compact, wireless, battery operated and power efficient. This study discusses the findings that the optimal location for a Fall Detection Sensor on the human body is in front of the Shin bone. This is based on the 183 features collected from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on 16 human body locations and trained-tested using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) machine learning paradigm. The ultimate goal is to develop a mobile, wireless, wearable, low-power medical device that uses a small Lattice iCE40 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) integrated with gyro and accelerometer sensors which detects whether the device wearer has fallen or not. This FPGA is capable of realizing the Neural Network model implemented in it.

For the complex scenes in surveillance video and the interference of multiple similar human behaviors, this paper proposes a method based on pose estimation and the auxiliary detection method based on yoloV5. First, extract video frames from different falling video sequences to form a data set; then, input the training sample set into the improved network for training until the network converges; finally, test the category of the target in the video according to the optimized network model and locate the target.

This paper presents a classifier application for colorectal tumors based on the TNM-O ontology. It was developed in the JAVA using the OWL-API. The TNM-O uses the Foundational Model of Anatomy for representing anatomical entities and BioTopLite2 as a domain-top-level ontology. The classifier application processes input data via a user interface or tabular data. The classification starts with the creation of RDF Individuals for each pathological information item formally described in the ontology. These Individuals are then classified by the HermiT Description Logics reasoner by A-Box classification. A dataset with 382 entries was provided by the pathology department of a university hospital. It was automatically classified with regard to metastatic regional lymph nodes. Results or expert classification by pathologists and automatic classification were compared. The automatic process helped to detect and explain inconsistencies between expert and automatic classifications.

With the limited failure examples collected during the practical operation, how to effectively leverage such failure cases to repair and enhance DNN so as to generalize to more potentially suspicious samples is challenging, but of great importance. In this paper, we formulate the failure-data-driven DNN repairing as a data augmentation problem, and design a novel augmentation-based repairing method, which to the best extent leverages limited failure cases. To realize the DNN repairing effects that generalize to specific failure examples, we originally propose few-shot guided mix (FSGMix) that augments training data with the guidance of failure examples.

However, such technologies cannot recognize these gestures without prior training. Even for the same gesture, with different gesture amplitude may result in unsuccessful recognition. On the other hand, if we change the person to perform the same gesture, the algorithms also fails. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose an approach, which will be able to track the human body motion in real-time and also recognize complicated gestures.

A physician's interview based method is described to define a orthogonal fuzzy symptom information system, required to apply the model. For the purpose of elaboration and elicitation of characteristics, the algorithm is applied to a simple simulated dataset, and compared with conventional naive Bayes (NB) approach. As a preliminary evaluation of FNB in real world scenario, the comparison is repeated on a real fuzzy dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. The case study on simulated dataset elucidates that FNB can be optimal over NB for diagnosing patients with imprecise-fuzzy information, on account of the following characteristics - 1) it can model the information that, values of some attributes are semantically closer than values of other attributes, and 2) it offers a mechanism to temper exaggerations in patient information. Although the algorithm requires precise training data, its utility for fuzzy training data is argued for. This is supported by the case study on infectious disease dataset, which indicates optimality of FNB over NB for the infectious disease domain.

Oftentimes different types of sensors are deployed in the hope of capturing precursor patterns that are highly correlated to a particular clinical episode, such as seizure, congestive heart failure etc. While there have been several studies that successfully identify patterns as reliable precursors for specific medical conditions, most of them require domain-specific knowledge and expertise. The developed algorithms are also unlikely to be applicable to other medical conditions. In this paper we present a generalized algorithm that discovers potential precursor patterns without prior knowledge or domain expertise. The algorithm makes use of wavelet transform and information theory to extract generic features, and it is also classifier agnostic.

The goal of depression detection is to improve diagnostic accuracy and availability, leading to faster intervention. The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust depression detection model. To this end, there are two challenges to overcome: 1) Multi-modal (audio, image, text, etc.) information must be jointly considered to make accurate inferences. 2) Existing deep learning-based work suffers from multi-modal data sufficiency problem. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention model embedded with multi-modal knowledge for depression detection.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data.

10.1109/INDIN45582.2020.9442246,Hybrid Label Noise Correction Algorithm For Medical Auxiliary Diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"In the context of the continuous development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Machine learning (ML) technology, its application in the medical field is becoming more and more extensive. However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based medical auxiliary diagnosis system, the impact of label noise problems is also increasing. When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, due to ambiguous patient conditions or poor reliability of diagnostic criteria, even clinical experts may lack confidence in making medical diagnoses for some patients. As a result, some samples used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, which adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we study a classification problem of sample labels with random damage. We propose a new hybrid label noise correction model that generalizes many learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. This hybrid model can withstand the negative effects of random noise and various non-random label noise. Extensive experimental results using real-world datasets from UCI machine learning repository are provided, the empirical study shows that our approach successfully improves data quality in many cases, in terms of classification accuracy, over existing label noise correction methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9442246/,2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),20-23 July 2020,ieeexplore

Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160454/,"2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",25-29 May 2015,ieeexplore

Measurements are conducted on a carotid artery flow phantom from Danish Phantom Design, and 20 frames are acquired with a constant flow rate of 16.7±0.17 mL/s provided by a Shelley Medical Imaging Technologies CompuFlow 1000 system. The peak velocity magnitude in the vessel is found to be 52.3±8.1 m/s compared to an expected peak velocity of 53.6±0.54 cm/s.

The primary issue of preventing gastric cancer is to assess its risk level. Most of the current approaches merely contain histological and demographic information for cancer risk assessment. However, the factors of patient-based information, such as family history, diet, high-risk habits and exposure to environmental carcinogens are often not considered in cancer prediction. To address the issue, we present a fully connected neural network method with weighted neighborhood feature (WNF-FCNN) to improve the accuracy of gastric cancer risk prediction based on patient-based information. We first adopt two feature selection schemes to choose weighted neighborhood feature from the 121 raw medical attributes about gastric cancer. Then, a four-layer FCNN is constructed to model the risk level of gastric cancer with Adam optimization algorithm being used to speed up the convergence during training stages. Empirical evaluations on a real hospital cancer medical dataset containing 50,611 records demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach.

This paper presents a solution to non-invasively equip a person with sensors of a Smart Training System (STS) to improve training efficiency during sport activities. Our system calculates the significance of each body part during physical activities and provides targeted feedback on which body locations are under-performing. In experiments, the system collected data from 13 inertial sensors attached to the entire body of inexperienced golf learners. Using an indoor golf training net with a central target with 3 concentric zones, 1,080 real-world golf swings of 11 participants were analyzed. During the first 30 swings of each participant, the system learned distributions of motions from each sensor, conditioned on swing performance reported by users from their hitting location on the target. In the later 70 swings, feedback was provided to a subgroup of 8 participants, by computing, for an optimal set of features determined during training, the largest discrepancy. The remaining 3 (control) participants received no feedback. From only 100 golf swings for each participant, our system led to significantly improved scores by on average 3.7x (t-test, p &lt;; 0.0001) over the latter 70 swings.

As computers and communication bandwidth become ever faster and cheaper, computing and communication capabilities are embedded in all types of objects and structures in the physical environment. Harnessing these capabilities to bridge the cyber-world with the physical world will allow the development of applications with great societal impact and economic benefit. At the heart of these applications are cyber-physical systems consisting of integrated computational and communication cores that interact with the physical world, with intelligence provided by embedded software. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are engineered systems that provide tight integration of and coordination between the cyber world of computing and communications and the physical world. CPS are to meet the needs of the new generation of engineered systems that are highly dependable, efficiently produced and certified, and capable of advanced performance in computation, communication, and control. CPS will transform how we interact with and control the physical world around us, as the Internet transformed how we interact and communicate with one another and revolutionized how and where we access information. One application domain of CPS is Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), which are life-critical, context-aware, networked systems of medical devices. Medical device industry is undergoing a transformation, embracing the potential of embedded software and network connectivity. Instead of stand-alone devices that can be designed, certified, and used to treat patients independent of each other, distributed systems that simultaneously control multiple aspects of the patient's physiology are increasingly used in hospitals to provide high-quality continuous care for patients. The combination of embedded software controlling medical devices, networking capabilities, and complicated physiological dynamics of patient bodies makes MCPS complex. The need to design complex MCPS that are both safe and effective presents numerous challenges, including achieving high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certification. In this talk, I will discuss these challenges in developing MCPS and present some of our work in addressing them, and several open research and development issues.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6264658/,IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN 2012),25-28 June 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/UPCON47278.2019.8980238,IoT Based eHealth Management System Using Arduino and Google Cloud Firestore,IEEE,Conferences,"With the global population crossing 7 billion, the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases is on the rise. According to WHO report, 17.9 million people die each year from CVDs, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of premature death in the world include heart attacks, strokes and other circulatory diseases. More than 75% of CVD deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries. So the challenge is how to provide a health-care monitoring system especially for rural areas which lacks in the established set up of cardio health centers. The scarcity of specialist can partially be solved with sharing the people medical information with professionals, specialists and artificial intelligence health management system on cloud to give information at early stage, which can increase the quality of life and also lessen the risk of death.

10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587406,Large margin pursuit for a Conic Section classifier,IEEE,Conferences,"Learning a discriminant becomes substantially more difficult when the datasets are high-dimensional and the available samples are few. This is often the case in computer vision and medical diagnosis applications. A novel conic section classifier (CSC) was recently introduced in the literature to handle such datasets, wherein each class was represented by a conic section parameterized by its focus, directrix and eccentricity. The discriminant boundary was the locus of all points that are equi-eccentric relative to each class-representative conic section. Simpler boundaries were preferred for the sake of generalizability. In this paper, we improve the performance of the two-class classifier via a large margin pursuit. When formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, the margin computation is demonstrated to be hard, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data. Instead, we present a geometric algorithm to compute the distance of a point to the non-linear discriminant boundary generated by the CSC in the input space. We then introduce a large margin pursuit in the learning phase so as to enhance the generalization capacity of the classifier. We validate the algorithm on real datasets and show favorable classification rates in comparison to many existing state-of-the-art binary classifiers as well as the CSC without margin pursuit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4587406/,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,23-28 June 2008,ieeexplore

10.1109/CRV.2017.15,Leveraging Tree Statistics for Extracting Anatomical Trees from 3D Medical Images,IEEE,Conferences,"Using different priors (e.g. shape and appearance) have proven critical for robust image segmentation of different types of target objects. Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

An efficient way of dealing with these data is by storing them in list-mode (LM). To reconstruct the data, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) is efficiently applied to the list-mode data, resulting in the list-mode maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (LMMLEM) reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we consider a PET system consisting of two thick detectors facing each other. PMT outputs are collected for each coincidence event and are used to perform 3D maximum-likelihood (ML) position estimation of location of interaction. The mathematical properties of the ML estimation allow accurate modeling of the detector blur and provide a theoretical framework for the subsequent estimation step, namely the LMM-LEM reconstruction. Indeed, a rigorous statistical model for the detector output can be obtained from calibration data and used in the calculation of the conditional probability density functions for the interaction location estimates.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images. Through a minimax two-player game, the generative and discriminative networks can train each other. The generated synthetic images are used to train a CNN classification model for tissue recognition. Through the experiments with the synthetic images, the tissue recognition accuracy achieves 98.83%, which reveals the effectiveness and applicability of synthesizing medical images through the GAN models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419363/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),4-7 June 2018,ieeexplore

Recent advances in image processing using the Convolution Neural Networks have led to better results in diagnosing systems. We aim to develop an advanced diagnostic system in a manner that meets the requirements of real-time and extensibility of medical services for skin disease detection. The proposed system provides offline diagnosis for the users who have not Internet connection or online diagnosing uses on-cloud service. The user captures the affected area and get the offline immediate report. The schema offers the users a communication window with dermatologists to get medical recommendations in addition to an online accurate diagnosis service. The new images that are labeled by dermatologists are used to retrain the model to enhance model accuracy. To maximize the number of users, the system is implemented in a mobile-based environment. With the growing numbers of portable apps, it becomes easy for people to obtain up-to-date data. Users are familiar with looking for answers from the virtual globe including health issues.

10.1109/SmartNets48225.2019.9069799,Modeling and Scheduling with DAG used for tasks in ME with OVP,IEEE,Conferences,"Several techniques have been proposed to adapt multimedia and telecommunication applications to resource constraints. These techniques are mostly implemented at the application layer and make simplistic assumptions about the system resources communication and they are often unconvinced to the co-design in embedded system SoC and MPSoC. Moreover, they often assume that the data codec video characteristics and their processing needs are stationary, which is not true in practice especially in hardware for the real target FPGA. In fact, data streams in codec video are highly dynamic and may also experience concept drift, thereby requiring continuous online adaptation of the throughput and quality to each processing task in video and frame. Hence, existing solutions for multimedia and telecommunication applications are often too conservative or too aggressive, especially in video codec. To address these limitations, complexity in video test, quality of frame, precision, send video with a fast time especially in medical applications, airport and military flight problems. we propose offline algorithm scheduling which minimize the execution time (i.e., troughput and output quality of video and frame) of medical and military applications under real time and resources constraints. Our algorithm scheduling uses offline and online reinforcement learning techniques. Moreover, our scheduler is able to detect concept drifts and to smoothly adapt the scheduling strategy (DAG algorithm). Our experiments realized on a chain of tasks modeling real-life streaming application demonstrate that our scheduler is able to learn the scheduling policy and to adapt it such that it minimizes the execution time and optimize the precision, quality of frame as the video codec characteristics are dynamically changing. The strategy of scheduling algorithm is to order the tasks in processor or different processors. This approach remade tow problem in static scheduling algorithm with video and frame processing (the physiological data of a patient and allows in cases of urgent problems to trigger an alarm remotely controlled by an expert to intervene quickly in case of emergency.

10.1109/ACITT.2019.8780078,Modern Hardware and Software Solution for Identification of Abnormal Neurological Movements of Patients with Essential Tremor,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the real physical movements, associated with tremor, which is very small rapid fluctuations that vary greatly in amplitude and frequency, reliable measurements of motion characteristics and the interpretation of the results of such measurements are important for the diagnosis of diseases. Increasing of amplitude and changing the frequency and form of oscillation in relation to the norm (frequency and amplitude of physiological tremor) are signs of disturbance of central and peripheral neural mechanisms of regulation of movements. Program analysis of these parameters is important for understanding the role of dysfunction of individual structures of the brain in the processes of motion management, and for the clinic in the aspects of early detection, more accurate diagnosis of motor disorders, the choice and correction of optimal treatment methods associated with the selection of effective therapy. The analysis of tremor forms has great importance in neurological practice, in particular, in the diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome. Computerized analysis methods are extremely accurate and effective in assessing the degree of tremor of patients. Mathematical modeling allows obtaining frequency characteristics, amplitude of oscillation, deviation from normal state, etc. Development of mathematical models and methods, means of identification greatly facilitate the work with patients; make it possible to assess the degree of disease with a single and objective side.

Consequently, it is necessary to adopt a regular screen to reduce brain damage and other complications. For one thing, the risk factors screened can be divided into 6 subsets: medical history, family history, fasting blood, lifestyle, physical characteristics, and demographic information. For another, the screen results can be categorized into 5 groups: normal carotid plaque, thickening, unstable plaque, and arterial stenosis. To address the above problems, Multi-View Multi-Label (MVML) learning provides a fundamental framework for handling such tasks, which treats the risk factors as multi-view data and the screen results as multi-label data. Besides, it is a challenging issue of how to effectively utilize view correlations and label correlations in MVML learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Multi-label Learning with Dual-Attention Networks (MML-DAN) for stroke screen, which can strike a balance between label-specific views and label correlations. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism aims to focus on the most pertinent information of the corresponding labels rather than using all available risk factors equally. Experiments on one real-world dataset of stroke screen demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MML-DAN for stroke screen prediction. To further validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of MML-DAN, extensive experiments on 5 benchmark MVML datasets show that MML-DAN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art MVML algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9313285/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),16-19 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described.

The classical setup where the observations and responses, i.e., (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) pairs, are Euclidean is well studied. The setting where yi is manifold valued is a topic of much interest, motivated by applications in shape analysis, topic modeling, and medical imaging. Recent work gives strategies for max-margin classifiers, principal components analysis, and dictionary learning on certain types of manifolds. For parametric regression specifically, results within the last year provide mechanisms to regress one real-valued parameter, x<sub>i</sub> ∈ R, against a manifold-valued variable, y<sub>i</sub> ∈ M. We seek to substantially extend the operating range of such methods by deriving schemes for multivariate multiple linear regression -- a manifold-valued dependent variable against multiple independent variables, i.e., f: ℝ<sup>n</sup> → M. Our variational algorithm efficiently solves for multiple geodesic bases on the manifold concurrently via gradient updates. This allows us to answer questions such as: what is the relationship of the measurement at voxel y to disease when conditioned on age and gender. We show applications to statistical analysis of diffusion weighted images, which give rise to regression tasks on the manifold GL(n)/O(n) for diffusion tensor images (DTI) and the Hilbert unit sphere for orientation distribution functions (ODF) from high angular resolution acquisition.

In vitro, ambient pressures were varied (between 0 and 120 mmHg) in a closed-loop flow system circulating 0.2 ml Sonazoid microbubbles (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) suspended in 750 ml of isotonic diluent and recorded by a Millar pressure catheter as the reference standard. Simultaneously, a SonixRP ultrasound scanner (Ultrasonix Medical Corp., Richmond, BC, Canada) operating in pulse inversion mode (f<sub>transmit</sub>: 2.5 MHz) was used to acquire unprocessed RF data at five different incident acoustic pressures (from 76 kPa to 897 kPa; n=3). The subharmonic data for each pulse was extracted using band-pass filtering with averaging, and subsequently, processed to eliminate noise. The incident acoustic pressure most sensitive to ambient pressure fluctuations was determined; then the ambient pressure was tracked over 20 seconds. Regression analysis compared subharmonic and catheter pressure values. In vivo validation of this technique was performed noninvasively for tracking left ventricular (LV) pressures of two canines using similar post processing as in vitro. The subharmonic signal tracked ambient pressures with r<sup>2</sup> = 0.922 for 20 seconds in vitro. In vivo the subharmonic signal tracked the LV pressures with r<sup>2</sup> &gt;; 0.7P90.

For instance, satellite images are taken via IR or NIR spectrometer and laser Doppler medical scanning is collaborated with NIR spectrometer. Matrix functions of any image correspond to brightness or energy at each image pixel. The actual decision making must rely on detailed investigation of images being obtained. Therefore, image processing should be taken into account so as to enhance the results from real world. Segmentation is an image analysis approach to clarify feature ambiguity and information noise, which divides an image into separate parts that correlate with the objects or areas of the particular object involved. This procedure can be conducted by clustering, which is a process of partitioning a set of pattern vectors into subsets. Being a simple unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm has the potential to both simplify the computation and accelerate the convergence. In most cases optimization is closely related to clustering, which gives rise to the best way of problem solving. In this article, optimal approach is proposed to be implemented along with image segmentation. This methodology is to enhance both large scale and small scale IR and NIR image processing",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1644370/,2005 International Conference on Industrial Electronics and Control Applications,29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,ieeexplore

New algorithms address challenges such as genome mapping, medical diagnostics, self-driving cars, autonomous robots and more. Deep learning in embedded systems requires high optimization due to the high computational demand, given that power, heat dissipation, size and price constraints are numerous. In this paper we analyze several acceleration methods which include utilization of GPUs for most complex variants of deep learning, such as semantic video segmentation operating in real time.

More specifically, Convolutional neural networks (CNN) show remarkable performance in tasks such as multi-class skin lesion classification using images. However, concerns remain about the deployment of such models, as real-world test data distribution can significantly differ from the distribution of the training data. In other words, models can classify unknown samples as known classes with high confidence, which could lead to catastrophic mistakes. In line with these concerns, this paper focuses on accessing the current methods to detect out-of-training distribution samples in the context of skin lesion classification.

Nowadays, there are several types of blood pressure meter available manufactured from various companies. In order to meet the demand on telemedicine and technology advancement, a new form of blood pressure meter is desirable. This prototype of blood pressure meter is interfaced with a personal computer (PC) which able to simulate the measurement process in real time. The proposed system is divided by two parts which are hardware and software. Hardware section includes pressure sensor, microcontroller, bulb, cuff and conditioning circuits. The systems operate on oscillometric principle which gives the results in terms of systolic, diastolic and MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure). Furthermore, these results will be presented and simulated on the software. MP Lab software packages is used to program the microcontroller. The user interface was developed by using Visual Basic 6.0 language, which highlights the user friendly attributes. Moreover, the simulated waveform will evaluate the blood pressure and gives the blood pressure value. This application shows significant improvement on the overall performance and gives reliable results. The average percentage difference for the systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the OMRON BP meter and proposed e-BPMS are ± 0.95% and ± 1.32% respectively, which is very small and still in the acceptable range.

The regular treatment is providing the patient with opioid pain relievers medications that in a wide variety of cases leads to addiction. To prevent the partial use of pain reducing drugs in patients that suffer from minor to medium pain and delay their use as much as possible, we propose the use of Virtual Reality technology. Current technological advances have allowed virtual reality application to leave their mark in the medical sector by the use of different training simulators and applications that help the doctors experience from simulating a variety of surgeries. In this paper we present the effects of Virtual Reality immersion on patients that suffer mild to medium pain, as well as our knowledge in the implementation of a virtual reality application that can achieve a positive effect on this serious issue.

Inherent to the efficacy of deep brain stimulation is the acquisition of an optimal parameter configuration. Using conventional methods, the optimization process for tuning the deep brain stimulation system parameters can intrinsically induce strain on clinical resources. An advanced means of quantifying Parkinson's hand tremor and distinguishing between parameter settings would be highly beneficial. The conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system, such as the BioStamp nPoint, has a volumetric profile on the order of a bandage that readily enables convenient quantification of Parkinson's disease hand tremor. Furthermore, the BioStamp nPoint has been certified by the FDA as a 510(k) medical device for acquisition of medical grade data. Parametric variation of the amplitude parameter for deep brain stimulation can be quantified through the BioStamp nPoint conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system mounted to the dorsum of the hand. The acquired inertial sensor signal data can be wirelessly transmitted to a secure Cloud computing environment for post-processing. The quantified inertial sensor data for the parametric study of the effects of varying amplitude can be distinguished through machine learning classification. Software automation through Python can consolidate the inertial sensor data into a suitable feature set format. Using the multilayer perceptron neural network considerable machine learning classification accuracy is attained to distinguish multiple parametric settings of amplitude for deep brain stimulation, such as 4.0 mA, 2.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and `Off' status representing a baseline. These findings constitute an advance toward the pathway of attaining real-time closed loop automated parameter configuration tuning for treatment of Parkinson's disease using deep brain stimulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9175408/,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),20-24 July 2020,ieeexplore

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

The method is validated by the proposed planar 3D res-u-net network with encoder transferred from the 2D VGG-16, which is applied for a single-stage unbalanced 3D image data segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the method on the MICCAI 2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset utilizing solely fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence without brain extraction for training and inference to simulate real medical praxis. The planar 3D res-u-net network performed the best both in sensitivity and Dice score amongst end to end methods processing raw MRI scans and achieved comparable Dice score to a state-of-the-art unimodal not end to end approach. Complete source code was released under the open-source license, and this paper complies with the Machine learning reproducibility checklist. By implementing practical transfer learning for 3D data representation, we could segment heavily unbalanced data without selective sampling and achieved more reliable results using less training data in a single modality. From a medical perspective, the unimodal approach gives an advantage in real praxis as it does not require co-registration nor additional scanning time during an examination. Although modern medical imaging methods capture high-resolution 3D anatomy scans suitable for computer-aided detection system processing, deployment of automatic systems for interpretation of radiology imaging is still rather theoretical in many medical areas.

However, this is a serious drawback in many practical applications. An example are medical systems that have to repeat an action infinitely often within given time bounds.

10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929317,Practical Significance of GA PartCC in Multi-Label Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Multi-label classification (MLC) can be defined as the objective of learning a classification model which has the capability to infer the accurate labels of new, previously unseen, objects where it is a likely situation that each object of the dataset may rightfully belong to multiple class labels. While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details.

In recent years, researchers have used deep recurrent neural networks to predict patients' next-period prescriptions. The main challenges of predicting next-period prescriptions are as follows: i) The latent interdependence information which can be utilized to enhance the representation of the data between heterogeneous features is dynamic. However, most existing approaches do not consider capturing and utilizing this information. ii) Conventional recurrent neural networks cannot store historical interdependent information between heterogeneous features and take advantage of it. To address these challenges, We propose a novel attention mechanism named Cross Attention (CA) that can capture the interdependence between two sequences.

10.1109/InnoTek.2014.6877371,Preventing recreational boating fatalities and serious injuries with: The ANN (Assistant Naval Navigator) System Enterprise,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the significant increase in motor vehicle fatalities due to texting while driving, several US States are implementing or drafting laws that will outright ban the use of handheld devices (“I” and cell Phones, pads, business communicators, etc.) while operating a motor vehicle. At the same time, US recreational boaters already are burdened with high numbers of fatal and injurious accidents, and are being encouraged to navigate using Internet-based APPs that require texting. Our analyses of trends in recent US Coast Guard's (USCG's) Boating Statistics<sup>1</sup> seem to support that accidents due to inattention are on the rise. Specifically, owner/operator inattention is causing a higher number of collisions with other recreational boats and these are accompanied by a related rise in fatalities per collision. This observation is in-line with the US Dept. of Transportation findings that texting while driving leads to more violent accidents; therefore, more fatalities/accident. Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction. Also alarming, in 13% of the 4515 accidents the cause was owner/operator inattention. Add to this, in 1010 accidents of the 4,515, these involved a collision with another recreational boat! (That's over 22% of the total accidents). It's shocking to realize that the number of moms, dads, young men and women and children that are dying and seriously injured per year, while enjoying this recreational activity, was nearly equaled the yearly US troop losses and serious injuries during the Iraq war. Over 10 years ago we began our design effort by assembling a team of experts having experience with on-water Emergency Response, and marine-related technologies. By then, the author and his direct associate had accumulated more than 70 years of successful installation and start-up of computer-based control systems for very large and small processes. The applications included major metals, chemical, plastics, ore-processing, underground coal mining industries, as well as, a medical enterprise application. We envisioned how the vessel navigation process may be adapted to feedforward/feedback control system architecture in real time. Proceeding on this basis, our team met frequently with system integrators, boat and engine manufacturers, Boat Owners Association of the US (BoatUS) Execs, towing station owner/operators and US Coast Guard Certified “A” Captains and pilots. In these meetings, our goal continued to focus on a plan for applying advanced control theory to enhance marine vessel navigation.

10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196,Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Belief Networks for Prognosis of Breast Cancer,IEEE,Conferences,"We propose a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) for prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer. PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes.

Meta-modeling is commonly adopted in the FMA with most of its classes and roles also specified as individuals, leading to undecidability in reasoning. The state-of-the-art reasoning and querying systems like Pellet often ignore the essence of such meta-modeling. In this paper we present a novel, effective approach to querying large and expressive medical ontologies. More precisely, a sub-language of OWL 2 Full is defined, denoted as Hi(SRIQ), to extend the DL language SRIQ with meta-modeling so that one name can be used as class, role and individual at the same time. We give an algorithm to construct multiple SRIQ knowledge bases from a Hi(SRIQ) ontology so that its reasoning and querying tasks can be reduced to be performed in these SRIQs in an independent way. Moreover, a meta-query language is designed to allow for variables present at class/role positions in query. Answering meta-query in constructed SRIQs is transformed into evaluating a group of conjunctive queries over single SRIQ through query partitioning and heuristic materialization of class/role variables in query. As a result, the Hi(SRIQ) version of the FMA yields eight SRIQs and an empirical study shows that our approach outperforms Pellet in query answering.

We recently proposed a robustness definition that considers input data degraded by alterations that may occur in reality; the approach was originally devised for image classification in the medical domain. In this paper, we extend the definition of robustness to any type of input for which some alterations can be defined. Then, we present ROBY, a tool for ROBustness analYsis of ANNs. The tool accepts different types of data (images, sounds, text, etc.) stored either locally or on Google Drive. The user can use some alterations provided by the tool, or define their own. The robustness computation can be performed either locally or remotely on Google Colab. The tool has been experimented for robustness computation of image and sound classifiers, used in the medical and automotive domains.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438585/,"2021 14th IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)",12-16 April 2021,ieeexplore

Authentication by gait identifies a person with his/her unique walking pattern. Gait has the advantage of being unobtrusive compared to other biometrics.

This paper mainly analyses gait features depending on acceleration sensors of smartphones and proposes a new gait authentication method based on the late fusion technique. By using Deep Hybrid Network (DHN), we develop an effective model for real-time authentication of users. DHN is a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), long short term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent unit (GRU), which are sequentially added to the model, and their features are combined to make a final decision by a softmax layer. The combination of networks is made by spreading the input features and changing the neural network's initial weights.

Though well trained clinicians, medical and psychological treatments are available for depression treatment, persons or families are reluctant to speak out/reach doctors about this disorder for various social reasons. Diagnosis of depression disorder includes numerous interviews with patient and family, clinical analysis, questionnaires which is time consuming and also demands well trained clinicians. In the present era of Machine learning, automation of depression detection is not complicated and can easily be deployed. However, the automation should use fewer resources, provide accurate results with more reachability. In this paper, acoustic features are used to train a classification model to categorize a human as Depressed or not-Depressed.

The sooner these diseases are detected, the better the patient's recovery. But colonoscopy is a demanding process, often leads to the high rate of misdiagnosis by experts, professional physicians and nurses and costs a lot of time. Therefore, robot-assisted colonoscopy is considered as an important method to solve this problem. In recent years, many automated deep learning models for colonoscopy have been proposed. However, these models are usually large and time-consuming, and cannot meet actual needs. Besides, due to the disconnection of data between hospitals, the strength of medical resources between different departments in different hospitals is different, so the general multi-classification model cannot fit the characteristics of such data distribution. Therefore, in this article, we ensemble multiple binary classification models (each model detects one disease) and extracted a compression model using knowledge distillation technology, which can simultaneously detect polyps, Merkel diverticula, ulcers and bleeding from colonoscopy.

Since that time, electroencephalography has expanded its uses in the medical field to diagnosing a wide variety of medical conditions, such as sleep disorders, comas, and migraines. This project's goal was to develop an intelligence system that can both read and classify EEG signals from a subject when he/she performs a facial gesture. The intelligence system would be designed to send control signals to a robotic arm to perform specific tasks, such as making a fist or grabbing an object. Following data collection, the intelligence system was able to successfully differentiate the signals produced from the various facial gestures. The robotic arm was then programmed to perform a specific gesture associated with each facial gesture, based on the result produced by the intelligence system. Based on the success, additional facial gestures would be added to the intelligence system with the goal of making it more effective. With a larger database of facial gestures, the robotic arm would be able to perform more physical movements, ultimately providing a wider range of motions for users to select from.

The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models. Experimental results show that SensoryGANs models have the capability of capturing the implicit distribution of real sensor data of human activity, and then the synthetic sensor data generated by SensoryGANs models Have a potential for improving human activity recognition.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489106/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

At present, many algorithms have achieved good results in the segmentation of skin diseases, such as super-pixel segmentation and U-Net network. The method we used in this paper is improved based on the instance segmentation model, Mask R-CNN. Firstly, we have trained the classification branch in Mask R-CNN in advanced. Secondly, we made some adjustments to the parameters of Mask R-CNN. These two changes ensure that our method has higher segmentation accuracy and detection accuracy than traditional Mask R-CNN.

However, objective performance measurement is currently difficult without 3D visualization, with effective surgical training apparatus being extremely expensive or limited in accessibility. This is problematic for medical students, especially in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic in which they are needed by the community but have few ways of practicing without lab access. In this work, we propose and prototype a system for augmented reality (AR) visualization of laparoscopic training tasks using cheap and widely-compatible borescopes, which can track small objects typical of surgical training. We use forward kinematics for calibration and multi-threading to attempt synchronization in order to increase compatibility with consumer applications, resulting in an effective AR simulation with low-cost devices and consumer software, while also providing dynamic camera and marker tracking.

In accidents like these, every second matters. Many times the medical services are unable to make it in time resulting in an unfortunate loss of life, making road accident deaths an integral issue. Also, chances of accidents are equally high during late hours. In an emergency at odd hours, one cannot guarantee if anyone will be present around to inform hospitals, or the police. This paper proposes an End-to-End Deep Learning solution to automate accident recognition and send real-time alerts to emergency services, that is the nearest hospitals and police stations.

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore

Many neurological diseases like paralysis are caused by the interruption of spike propagation due to the malfunctioning neurons in the signaling pathway where the spikes are carried. In this paper, we propose a neuron specific statistical multiplexing scheme to substitute a faulty sensory neural pathway with a neighboring functional one. Since the spikes are stereotyped events and they have no addressing information, we developed an addressing scheme utilizing the spikes themselves. The performance achieved by the proposed technique is analyzed in terms of the percentage of the spikes transmitted under various scenarios. We also compared the results obtained with the previously proposed TDMA based multiplexing schemes. The proposed statistical multiplexing based technique has lower implementation complexity than the previously introduced TDMA based techniques. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed technique when a priority mechanism is employed. The concept of multiplexing spikes to substitute a faulty neural pathway with a functional pathway reveals new opportunities in neuronal communication and may pave the way to the real healthcare applications of nanonetworking in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7002111/,2014 6th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT),6-8 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore

Unsurprisingly, the cybersecurity of MCPS is of high concern, as they are life-critical systems that, if compromised, may result in dire consequences to the patient. A variety of security requirements have been developed over the past 10 years as a result of governmental acts such as HITECH in order to better secure and protect healthcare environments.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8091750,The feasibility of deep learning algorithms integration on a GPU-based ultrasound research scanner,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound medical diagnostics is a real-time modality based on a doctor's interpretation of images. So far, automated Computer-Aided Diagnostic tools were not widely applied to ultrasound imaging. The emerging methods in Artificial Intelligence, namely deep learning, gave rise to new applications in medical imaging modalities. The work's objective was to show the feasibility of implementing deep learning algorithms directly on a research scanner with GPU software beamforming. We have implemented and evaluated two deep neural network architectures as part of the signal processing pipeline on the ultrasound research platform USPlatform (us4us Ltd., Poland). The USPlatform is equipped with a GPU cluster, enabling full software-based channel data processing as well as the integration of open source Deep Learning frameworks. The first neural model (S-4-2) is a classical convolutional network for one-class classification of baby body parts. We propose a simple 6-layer network for this task. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 786 ultrasound images of a fetal training phantom. The second model (Gu-net) is a fully convolutional neural network for brachial plexus localisation. The model uses `U-net'-like architecture to compute the overall probability of target detection and the probability mask of possible target locations. The model was trained and evaluated on 5640 ultrasound B-mode frames. Both training and inference were performed on a multi-GPU (Nvidia Titan X) cluster integrated with the platform. As performance metrics we used: accuracy as a percentage of correct answers in classification, dice coefficient for object detection, and mean and std. dev. of a model's response time. The `S-4-2' model achieved 96% classification accuracy and a response time of 3 ms (334 predictions/s). This simple model makes accurate predictions in a short time.

Distributed Databases represents a software system that allows a multitude of applications to access the data stored in local or remote databases. In this scenario, the data distribution is achieved through the process of replication. Nowadays many solutions for storing the data are available: relational distributed Database Management Systems (DBMS), NoSQL storing solutions, NewSQL storing solutions, graph oriented databases, object oriented databases, object-relational databases, etc. The present study analyzes the most commonly used storing solution: the relational model. The replication topology used in the related experiments was the classical publisher-subscriber topology. The distribution of data is made from the publisher system. The present work studies the interaction between the most suited distributed data mining architecture (Distributed Committee Machines) for mining distributed data and real relational distributed databases. The chosen Data Mining task is the classification one. Distributed Committee Machines are a group of neuronal networks working in a distributed procedure to obtain an improved classification performance compared to a single neural structure. In these experiments we used the classical multilayer perceptron trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The execution performance of the Distributed Committee Machine is analyzed, based on some of the most used types of replication in relational databases: snapshot replication, merge replication, transactional replication, and transactional with queued updating replication. For all these types of replications the execution performances (distributed speedup and distributed efficiency) of the entire system is also analyzed.

Although there have been studies on diversity and its links to overall ensemble accuracy, little work has been done on the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures in class imbalance learning. The study of class imbalance learning is important, because many real-world problems, such as those in medical diagnosis, fraud detection, condition monitoring, etc., have imbalanced classes, where a minority class is usually more important and interesting than the majority class. In order to gain a deeper understanding of ensemble learning for imbalanced classes, this paper studies the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures theoretically and empirically.

10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005488,Towards comparing and using Machine Learning techniques for detecting and predicting Heart Attack and Diseases,IEEE,Conferences,"Heart diseases are one of the deadly but are silent killers for humans, which results in the increase in death rate of sufferers every year. The World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2016, reported that 17.9 million deaths that occur worldwide per year are a result of heart disease. In the health care sector, enormous data are being generated on a daily basis, which contains different types of data, and acquiring knowledge from these data is essential. This knowledge can be acquired using various data mining techniques to mine knowledge by designing models from the medical records dataset. We implement a machine learning based system that can detect and predict heart diseases in patients using the medical records of patients. The proposed solution is based on existing techniques like Random Forest Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression, which provides a decision support system for medical professionals to detect and predict heart diseases and heart attacks in humans or individuals using risk factors of heart disease. The dataset used in our model consists of 18 features (risk factors) and 1990 observations after performing preprocessing. It was then split into 80% train sets and 20% test sets. Using real medical records of patients, a series of experiments were conducted to examine the performance and accuracy of the proposed system. The system was implemented in RStudio platform which predicts the risk of heart disease in patients.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092364,Towards real-time implementation of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) — How to Identify optimum acoustic output for SHAPE?,IEEE,Conferences,"Pressure measurements within the chambers of the heart yield critical information for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients (~92 million Americans), but the procedure used to gain these pressures, cardiac catheterization, is invasive and expensive. Subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) may be able to estimate intra-cardiac pressures noninvasively, if the optimum incident acoustic output (IAO) for SHAPE can be established in real-time. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine in real-time the optimum IAO for SHAPE. We developed a customized interface on a SonixTablet scanner (BK Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) using C/C++ and Qt libraries (The Qt Company, Oslo, Norway). In vitro experiments were conducted using a closed-loop flow system. Activated Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, N. Billerica, MA, USA; 0.1 ml) was mixed with 750 ml isotonic diluent. A pressure catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was used to acquire ambient pressure values. A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (f<sub>transmit</sub>: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). At the optimum IAO level the correlation coefficient between SHAPE and the pressure catheter data ranged between -0.6 and -0.9; for the IAO immediately below and above the optimum IAO, ranges were -0.4 to -0.8, and -0.6 to -0.8, respectively. In conclusion, optimum IAO level determination for insonating microbubbles to be utilized for SHAPE has been demonstrated; this will assist in real-time clinical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8092364/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets.

In this research, we used a combination of real stone-contained images and synthesized stone-embedded images to train U-Net model to segment urinary stones in abdominal x-ray images. Furthermore, the simple augmentation methods which appear realistic in x-ray images were also implemented in these combined datasets.

Here, we propose a novel deformable image registration approach based on weakly supervised learning that can be applied to registering ssEM images at scale.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048435,A Comprehensive Fuzzy Ontology-Based Decision Support System for Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis,IEEE,Journals,"The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the proportion of the elderly will soon include nearly a quarter of the world population. Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries. ADDO currently includes 7060 concepts, 99 properties, 46274 axioms, and 30708 annotations. As a result, ADDO is consistent and more reliable in managing most AD aspects than other existing AD ontologies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311736/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Different intelligent application scenarios can benefit from these computer-based systems that predict the ages of people correctly. Automatic apparent age system is particularly useful in medical diagnosis, facial beauty product development, movie role casting, the effect of plastic surgery, and anti-aging treatment. Predicting the real and apparent age of people has been quite difficult for both machines and humans. More recently, Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods have been extensively used for these classification task. It has incomparable advantages in extracting discriminative image features from human faces. However, many of the existing CNN-based methods are designed to be deeper and larger with more complex layers that makes it challenging to deploy on mobile devices with resource-constrained features. Therefore, we design a lightweight CNN model of fewer layers to estimate the real and apparent age of individuals from unconstrained real-time face images that can be deployed on mobile devices. The experimental results, when analyzed for classification accuracy on FG-NET, MORPH-II and APPA-REAL, with large-scale face images containing both real and apparent age annotations, show that our model obtains a state-of-the-art performance in both real and apparent age classification when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Our method is capable of incorporating high-dimensional information inherent in MV features generated from available inputs using the proposed DCA-based scheme.

Fitness trackers have become popular which record steps taken and distance, typically using a fixed stride length. While useful for everyday purposes, medical monitoring requires precise accuracy and testing on real patients with a scientifically valid measure. Walking speed is closely linked to morbidity in patients and widely used for medical assessment via measured walking. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a standard assessment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Current generation smartphone hardware contains similar sensor chips as in medical devices and popular fitness devices.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905875,A Novel Definition of Equivalent Uniform Dose Based on Volume Dose Curve,IEEE,Journals,"With the improvement of mobile device performance, the requirement of equivalent dose description in intensity-modulated radiation therapy is increasing in mobile multimedia for healthcare. The emergence of mobile cloud computing will provide cloud servers and storage for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) mobile applications, thus realizing visualized radiotherapy in a real sense. Equivalent uniform dose (EUD) is a biomedical indicator based on the dose measure. In this paper, the dose volume histogram is used to describe the dose distribution of different tissues in target and nontarget regions. The traditional definition of EUD, such as the exponential form and the linear form, has only a few parameters in the model for fast calculation. However, there is no close relationship between this traditional definition and the dose volume histogram. In order to establish the consistency between the EUD and the dose volume histogram, this paper proposes a novel definition of EUD based on the volume dose curve, called VD-EUD. By using a unique organic volume weight curve, it is easy to calculate VD-EUD for different dose distributions. In definition, different weight curves are used to represent the biological effects of different organs. For the target area, we should be more careful about those voxels with a low dose (cold point); thus, the weight curve is monotonically decreasing. While for the nontarget area, the curve is monotonically increasing. Furthermore, we present the curves for parallel, serial, and mixed organs of nontarget areas separately, and we define the weight curve form with only two parameters. Medical doctors can adjust the curve interactively according to different patients and organs. We also propose a fluence map optimization model with the VD-EUD constraint, which means that the proposed EUD constraint will lead to a large feasible solution space. We compare the generalized EUD (gEUD) and the proposed VD-EUD by experiments, which show that the VD-EUD has a closer relationship with the dose volume histogram. If the biological survival probability is equivalent to the VD-EUD, the feasible solution space would be large, and the target areas can be covered. By establishing a personalized organic weight curve, medical doctors can have a unique VD-EUD for each patient. By using the flexible and adjustable EUD definition, we can establish the VD-EUD-based fluence map optimization model, which will lead to a larger solution space than the traditional dose volume constraint-based model. The VD-EUD is a new definition; thus, we need more clinical testing and verification.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673563/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have assisted DL-based segmentation models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fields critical to human beings, such as medicine. However, the existing state-of-the-art methods often use computationally expensive operations to achieve high accuracy and lightweight networks often lack a precise medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes an accurate and efficient DCNN model (AEDCN-Net) based on an elaborate preprocessing step and a resourceful model architecture. The AEDCN-Net exploits bottleneck, atrous, and asymmetric convolution-based residual skip connections in the encoding path that reduce the number of trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) to learn feature representations with a larger receptive field. The decoding path employs the nearest-neighbor based upsampling method instead of a computationally resourceful transpose convolution operation that requires an extensive number of trainable parameters. The proposed method attains a superior performance in both computational time and accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The results of benchmarking using four real-life medical image datasets specifically illustrate that the AEDCN-Net has a faster convergence compared to the computationally expensive state-of-the-art models while using significantly fewer trainable parameters and FLOPs that result in a considerable speed-up during inference.

To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive weighting and scalable distance regularized level set evolution (AW-SDRLSE) method for delineating lymphoma boundaries on 2D PET slices. There are three important characteristics with respect to AW-SDRLSE: 1) A scalable distance regularization term is proposed and a parameter <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$q$</tex-math></inline-formula> can control the contour's convergence rate and precision in theory. 2) A novel dynamic annular mask is proposed to calculate mean intensities of local interior and exterior regions and further define the region energy term. 3) As the level set method is sensitive to parameters, we thus propose an adaptive weighting strategy for the length and area energy terms using local region intensity and boundary direction information. AW-SDRLSE is evaluated on 90 cases of real PET data with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8796.

Various studies have developed automatic critical fall detection systems for emergency alarms and medical services. Window sizes and segmentation approaches would affect the system performance in terms of power consumption, computational speed and reliability that are essential considerations in the real-world implementation. Intuitively, employing shorter window sizes and simpler segmentation approaches leads to a faster detection speed and better power efficiency. However, few works explore the effects of windowing methods on detection performance, especially for machine learning models. This paper investigates the impact of segmentation approaches and window sizes in wearable-based critical fall detection systems with machine learning models.

Application of these methods to medical signals and images can help caregivers form proper decision-making. One of the important IoMT medical application areas includes aggressive driving behaviors to mitigate road incidents and crashes. Various IoMT-enabled body sensors or camera sensors can be utilized for real-time monitoring and detection of drivers' bio-signal status such as heart rate, blood pressure, and drivers' behaviors. However, it requires a lightweight detection module and a powerful training module with real-time storing and analysis of drivers' behaviors data from these medical devices to detect driving behaviors and provides instant feedback by the administrator for safety, gas emissions, and energy/fuel consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a bio-signal-based system for real-time detection of aggressive driving behaviors using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model with edge and cloud technologies. More precisely, the system consists of three modules, which are the driving behaviors detection module implemented on edge devices in the vehicle, the training module implemented in the cloud platform, and the analyzing module placed in the monitoring environment connected with a telecommunication network.

It is relatively easier to segment prostate from MR images than from CT images, due to better soft tissue contrast of the MR images. For segmenting prostate from CT images, most previous methods mainly used CT alone, and thus their performances are often limited by low tissue contrast in the CT images. In this article, we explore the possibility of using indirect guidance from MR images for improving prostate segmentation in the CT images. In particular, we propose a novel deep transfer learning approach, i.e., MR-guided CT network training (namely MICS-NET), which can employ MR images to help better learning of features in CT images for prostate segmentation. In MICS-NET, the guidance from MRI consists of two steps: (1) learning informative and transferable features from MRI and then transferring them to CT images in a cascade manner, and (2) adaptively transferring the prostate likelihood of MRI model (i.e., well-trained convnet by purely using MR images) with a view consistency constraint. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate MICS-NET on a real CT prostate image set, with the manual delineations available as the ground truth for evaluation.

They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims.

With the increasing number of people infected, healthcare systems, especially those in developing countries, are bearing tremendous pressure. There is an urgent need for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the prognosis of inpatients. To alleviate these problems, a data-driven medical assistance system is put forward in this article. Based on two real-world data sets in Wuhan, China, the proposed system integrates data from different sources with tools of machine learning (ML) to predict COVID-19 infected probability of suspected patients in their first visit, and then predict mortality of confirmed cases.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136648/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results. Experiments demonstrate that COAM can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction and provide clinically meaningful explanations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8761846/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Due to the large amount of data to be transmitted in the reconstructed model and the small storage capacity, data need to be compressed progressively before transmission. On this basis, we proposed a lightweight progressive transmission algorithm based on large data visualization in telemedicine to improve transmission efficiency and achieve lossless transmission of original data. Moreover, a novel four-layer system architecture based on IoT has been introduced, including the sensing layer, analysis layer, network layer and application layer. In this way, the three-dimensional reconstructed data at the local end is compressed and transmitted to the remote end, and then visualized at the remote end to show reconstructed 3D models.

The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS.

In this article, we propose a novel spatiotemporal two-streams generative adversarial network (SpGAN) as a cross-modality data processing approach to deploy the medical IoT in infarction learning. Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance.

The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components. Eventually, various principal components are accumulated for clustering using scatter plots. The long-term objective of this intelligent-control approach is to create a real-time technique for sample analysis, using a Raman spectrometer directly mounted at the end-effectors of medical robots, which is to enhance the robotic surgery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381368/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Jan. 2005,ieeexplore

Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax.

Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc+, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN.

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection.

The purpose of this study is to investigate and implement a new intuitive and space-conscious visualization framework, called DBMap, to facilitate efficient multidimensional data visualization and knowledge discovery against the large-scale data warehouses of integrated image and nonimage data. The DBMap framework is built upon the TreeMap concept. TreeMap is a space constrained graphical representation of large hierarchical data sets, mapped to a matrix of rectangles, whose size and color represent interested database fields. It allows the display of a large amount of numerical and categorical information in limited real estate of the computer screen with an intuitive user interface. DBMap has been implemented and integrated into a large brain research data warehouse to support neurologic and neuroradiologic research at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. For imaging specialists and clinical researchers, this novel DBMap framework facilitates another way to better explore and classify the hidden knowledge embedded in medical image data warehouses.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1331412/,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,Sept. 2004,ieeexplore
10.1109/TSMC.2017.2759090,Deep Additive Least Squares Support Vector Machines for Classification With Model Transfer,IEEE,Journals,"The additive kernel least squares support vector machine (AK-LS-SVM) has been well used in classification tasks due to its inherent advantages. For example, additive kernels work extremely well for some specific tasks, such as computer vision classification, medical research, and some specialized scenarios. Moreover, the analytical solution using AK-LS-SVM can formulate leave-one-out cross-validation error estimates in a closed form for parameter tuning, which drastically reduces the computational cost and guarantee the generalization performance especially on small and medium datasets. However, AK-LS-SVM still faces two main challenges: 1) improving the classification performance of AK-LS-SVM and 2) saving time when performing a grid search for model selection. Inspired by the stacked generalization principle and the transfer learning mechanism, a layer-by-layer combination of AK-LS-SVM classifiers embedded with transfer learning is proposed in this paper. This new classifier is called deep transfer additive kernel least square support vector machine (DTA-LS-SVM) which overcomes these two challenges. Also, considering that imbalanced datasets are involved in many real-world scenarios, especially for medical data analysis, the deep-transfer element is extended to compensate for this imbalance, thus leading to the development of another new classifier iDTA-LS-SVM. In the hierarchical structure of both DTA-LS-SVM and iDTA-LS-SVM, each layer has an AK-LS-SVM and the predictions from the previous layer act as an additional input feature for the current layer. Importantly, transfer learning is also embedded to guarantee generalization consistency between the adjacent layers. Moreover, both iDTA-LS-SVM and DTA-LS-SVM can ensure the minimal leaveone-out error by using the proposed fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy on the training set in each layer. We compared the proposed classifiers DTA-LS-SVM and iDTA-LS-SVM with the traditional LS-SVM and SVM using additive kernels on seven public UCI datasets and one real world dataset. The experimental results show that both DTA-LS-SVM and iDTALS-SVM exhibit better generalization performance and faster learning speed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8125563/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",July 2019,ieeexplore

After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000. Such initial extreme class imbalance during domain gamification poses a big challenge for the Watson machine-learning pipelines. The combination of ingested corpus sets, question-and-answer pairs, configuration settings, and NLP algorithms contribute toward the challenging data state. We propose several data engineering techniques, such as answer key vetting and expansion, source ingestion, oversampling classes, and question set modifications to increase the computed true labels. In addition, algorithm engineering, such as an implementation of the Newton-Raphson logistic regression with a regularization term, relaxes the constraints of class imbalance during training adaptation.

In this article, we propose a method based on machine learning (ML) and wearable sensors to identify the optimal exercises for the efficient detection of PD in patients.

10.1109/TSMC.2019.2958094,Design and Analysis of a Human–Machine Interaction System for Researching Human’s Dynamic Emotion,IEEE,Journals,"Dynamic emotion is typically used to facilitate human–machine interactions. Conversational data from social media contain a considerable amount of useful information, and such data are the foundation for researching dynamic and artificial emotion. At present, most human–machine interaction systems focus on the complexity and accuracy of the dialog but neglect the emotional characteristics of the speaker. When generating a dialog considering the emotional personality of the interlocutor, controlling, and guiding the dialog to a specified direction are essential. This article presents a system for studying dynamic emotions in human-computer interaction from the perspective of emotional transfer and guidance. Based on the emotional state of the interlocutor and the distribution of emotional transfer, the process of emotional transfer is simulated and sampled, and the sequence of emotional guidance is generated. In this system, two algorithms are proposed. A generative Markov chain Monte Carlo (GEN-MCMC) algorithm is proposed to generate a variety of emotional transfer sequences that fit the talke’s personality dynamically based on the real-world dialog. Further, a guiding MCMC (GUI-MCMC) algorithm-based GEN-MCMC is proposed to generate the emotional guiding sequences. The generated emotional sequences by GEN-MCMC were evaluated in two aspects: 1) consistency and 2) diversity. The experimental results show that the GEN-MCMC algorithm performs better than the general sequence generation algorithm in terms of consistency and diversity in generating emotional states. The GUI-MCMC was able to generate a proper stimulus sequence when given the first and target emotions. An emotional stimulus sequence can simulate the emotional transfer of the interlocutor in the process of dialogue, and give the observer appropriate reference to guide and control the emotions of dialogue. The experimental results show that the proposed system can effectively model the dynamic emotion in emotional transfer and guidance, which can be further used to build chat robots, intelligent assistants, and human–machine interaction systems. The models can also be used for emotional induction and enhance the feel-good or feel-terrible factor in human–machine communication applications, such as medical treatment of mental diseases, interrogation, and psychological attack and defense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943333/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Oct. 2021,ieeexplore

Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133296/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,May-June 2012,ieeexplore

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019.

This is because the scale step is limited by conditional stability of explicit schemes. We introduce the unconditionally stable semiimplicit linearized difference scheme that is fashioned after additive operator split (AOS) [Weickert, J. et al. (1998)], [Goldenberg, R et al., (2001)] for Beltrami and the subjective surface computation. The Beltrami flow [Kimmel, R. (1997) (1999)], [Sochen, N. et al. (1998)], is one of the most effective denoising algorithms in image processing. For gray-level images, we show that the flow equation can be arranged in an advection-diffusion form, revealing the edge-enhancing properties of this flow. This also suggests the application of AOS method for faster convergence. The subjective surface [Sarti, A. et al. (2002)] deals with constructing a perceptually meaningful interpretation from partial image data by mimicking the human visual system. However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required. We first show that the governing equation for the subjective surface flow can be rearranged in an AOS implementation, providing a near real-time solution to the shape completion problem in 2D and 3D. Then, we devise a new initialization paradigm where we first ""condition"" the viewpoint surface using the fast-marching algorithm.

These filters also reduce the information content of the image by suppressing spatial frequencies or by recognizing only a limited set of shapes. Here we show that denoising can be efficiently done using a nonlinear filter, which operates along patch neighborhoods and multiple copies of the original image. The use of patches enables the algorithm to account for spatial correlations in the random field whereas the multiple copies are used to recognize the noise statistics. The nonlinear filter, which is implemented by a hierarchical multistage system of multilayer perceptrons, outperforms state-of-the-art denoising algorithms such as those based on collaborative filtering and total variation. Compared to conventional denoising algorithms, our filter can restore images without blurring them, making it attractive for use in medical imaging where the preservation of anatomical details is critical.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7055927/,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,Sept. 2015,ieeexplore

Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion.

However, their superior performance relies on correctly annotated large-scale datasets. It is very expensive and time-consuming to get the annotated large-scale datasets, especially in the medical field. While collecting a large amount of data is relatively easy, given the amount of data available on the web, but these data are highly unreliable, and they often include a massive amount of noisy labels. The past research works have shown that these noisy labels could significantly affect the performance of the deep convolutional neural networks on image classification. However, training a robust deep convolutional neural network with extremely noisy labels is a very challenging task. Inspired by the co-teaching concept, this paper proposes a novel method for training a robust convolutional neural network with extremely noisy labels, which is called group-teaching. Specifically, we train a group of convolutional neural networks simultaneously, and let them teach each other by selecting possibly clean samples for each network in each mini-batch. Each network back propagates the samples selected by other networks except itself and then it updates itself. The empirical results on noisy versions of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in the robustness for noisy labels. Particularly, to verify the efficacy of our group-teaching in real-world noisy labels distribution, we have also validated the effectiveness of our method on the real-world noisy WebVision1000-100 dataset.

In recent years, some popular methods based on deep learning have been used for text classification, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. However, some problems are still encountered when classifying Chinese text. For example, important but obscure context information in Chinese text is not easily extracted. To improve the effect of Chinese text classification, we propose a novel classification model in this paper named the hierarchical comprehensive context modeling network (HCCMN) that can extract more comprehensive context. Our approach aims to extract contextual information and integrate it with the original input and then extract hierarchically more context, spatial information and high-weight local features from the integrated results. In addition, our method can remember long-term historical obscure information.

However, the majority of these robots are overly complex, and require teleoperation via either a skilled operator or a specialised device, and often the operator must be present at the scene to navigate safely around the casualty. Instead, improving the autonomy of such robots can reduce the reliance on expert operators and potentially unstable communication systems, while still extracting the casualty in a safe manner. There are several stages in the casualty extraction procedure, from navigating to the location of the emergency, safely approaching and loading the casualty, to finally navigating back to the medical assistance location. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Decomposed-Objective based Model Predictive Control (HiDO-MPC) method for safely approaching and manoeuvring around the casualty. We implement this controller on ResQbot — a proof-of-concept mobile rescue robot we previously developed — capable of safely rescuing an injured person lying on the ground, i.e. performing the casualty extraction procedure. HiDO-MPC achieves the desired casualty extraction behaviour by decomposing the main objective into multiple sub-objectives with a hierarchical structure. At every time step, the controller evaluates this hierarchical decomposed objective and generates the optimal control decision. We have conducted a number of experiments both in simulation and using the real robot to evaluate the proposed method’s performance, and compare it with baseline approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy gives significantly better results than baseline approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and execution time, when applied to casualty extraction scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369351/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we presents methods for extending FAST, an open-source high performance framework for medical imaging, to use any IE with a common programming interface. Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds. For volume processing, using the CPU or the GPU, showed a difference of 2 vs. 53 seconds, and for processing an whole slide microscopy image, the difference was 81 seconds vs. almost 16 minutes.

The technologies introduced in this paper are based on two key methods for real-time transformation of the photographic-quality Reinhard tone-mapping operator on emerging appliances, without compromising its quality. The first allows computing convolutions “selectively,” yielding faster computation than state-of-the-art convolution techniques while requiring a significantly lower memory footprint. The second utilizes machine learning to decrease the number of required convolutions per pixel. Both methods allow for scalable parallel implementation on commodity multicore processors and embedded processors. We also extend this implementation to 3-D and higher dimensions on massively parallel architectures for possible important applications such as medical imaging and multispectral or hyperspectral imaging applications. The inverse tone-mapping operation is equally important for rendering legacy content on new HDR displays. We used the underlying tone-mapping operator to perform inverse tone mapping using the two key methods described above. While existing techniques generally extend the dynamic range from the highlights side, our new operator performs two-sided expansion, yielding enhanced details in shades (and highlights) with generally negligible visible contrast loss. Applications of these technologies include 3-D volume rendering for the medical and seismic industries, video display on HDR television screens, and next-generation digital cameras and smart phones performing on-the-fly tone mapping.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5643226/,IBM Journal of Research and Development,Nov.-Dec. 2010,ieeexplore

Input data perseveration is a method to train more responsive RNN-based models. Input data is replicated k times during training and deployment.

To address this, this study identifies the diagnostic strategy learning problem and proposes a novel framework consisting of three components to learn a diagnostic strategy with limited features. First, as we often encounter incomplete medical records of the patients, a sequence encoder is designed to encode any set of information in various sizes into fixed-length vectors. Second, taking the output of the encoder as the input, a feature selector based on reinforcement learning techniques is proposed to learn the best feature sequence for diagnosis.

Particularly, our method learns the hidden knowledge within EMRs by locally remembering individual patterns of a patient (via local memory) and globally remembering group evidence of disease (via global memory). In addition, we show how our model can be modified to classify the hidden states of EMRs from different patients at each time step into different phases that indicate the progressions of medications in terms of a specific disease, in an unsupervised manner.

CNNs have large memory footprints, which obstructs their implementation on mobile devices, and require numerous floating point operations, which results in slow CPU inference times. In this article, we propose three approaches to training efficient CNNs that can operate in real-time on a CPU (catering to a clinical setting), with a low memory footprint, for minimal compromise in accuracy. We first demonstrate the power of `thin' CNNs (with very few feature channels) for fast medical image segmentation. We then leverage separable convolutions to further speed up inference, reduce parameter count and facilitate mobile deployment. Lastly, we propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to boost the accuracy of light-weight models, while maintaining inference speed-up. For a negligible sacrifice in test set Dice performance on the challenging ultrasound analysis task of nerve segmentation, our final proposed model processes images at 30 fps on a CPU, which is 9× faster than the standard U-Net, while requiring 420× less space in memory.

These scenarios call for more advanced performance in application-specific algorithms and efficient hardware support. Warnings on health emergencies sensitive to response speed require low latency output and action early detection capabilities. Medical monitoring that works in an always-on edge platform needs the system processor to have extreme energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MC-LSTM, a functional and versatile 3D skeleton-based action detection system, for the above demands. Our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on trimmed and untrimmed cases of general-purpose and medical-specific datasets with early-detection features. Further, the MC-LSTM accelerator supports parallel inference on up to 64 input channels. The implementation on Xilinx ZCU104 reaches a throughput of 18 658 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and an inference latency of 3.5 ms with the batch size of 64. Accordingly, the power consumption is 3.6 W for the whole FPGA+ARM system, which is 37.8x and 10.4x more energy-efficient than the high-end Titan X GPU and i7-9700 CPU, respectively. Meanwhile, our accelerator also keeps a 4 ~ 5x energy efficiency advantage against the low-power high-performance Firefly-RK3399 board carrying an ARM Cortex-A72+A53 CPU.

Therefore, in order for convenient real-time MI detection, it is essential to design lightweight models suitable for resource-limited portable devices. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel lightweight model (ML-Net), that provides a new solution for portable detection devices with limited resources. In ML-Net, each electrocardiogram (ECG) lead is assigned an independent channel, ensuring data independence and preserve the ECG characteristics of different angles represented by different leads. Moreover, convolution kernels of heterogeneous sizes are utilized to achieve accurate classification with only a small amount of lead data. Extensive experiments over actual ECG data from the PTB diagnostic database are conducted to evaluate ML-Net.

If a domain shift exists, i.e. differences in image statistics between training and test data, care needs to be taken to ensure reliable deployment in real-world scenarios. In digital pathology, domain shift can be manifested in differences between whole-slide images, introduced by for example differences in acquisition pipeline - between medical centers or over time. In order to harness the great potential presented by deep learning in histopathology, and ensure consistent model behavior, we need a deeper understanding of domain shift and its consequences, such that a model's predictions on new data can be trusted. This work focuses on the internal representation learned by trained convolutional neural networks, and shows how this can be used to formulate a novel measure - the representation shift - for quantifying the magnitude of model-specific domain shift. We perform a study on domain shift in tumor classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained images, by considering different datasets, models, and techniques for preparing data in order to reduce the domain shift. The results show how the proposed measure has a high correlation with drop in performance when testing a model across a large number of different types of domain shifts, and how it improves on existing techniques for measuring data shift and uncertainty. The proposed measure can reveal how sensitive a model is to domain variations, and can be used to detect new data that a model will have problems generalizing to.

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model.

To solve the first problem, we propose an algorithm Topk-NSP to mine the k most frequent negative patterns. In Topk-NSP, we first mine the top-k PSPs using the existing methods, and then we use an idea which is similar to top-k PSPs mining to mine the top-k NSPs from these PSPs. To solve the remaining two problems, we propose three optimization strategies for Topk-NSP. The first optimization strategy is that, in order to consider the influence of PSPs when selecting useful top-k NSPs, we introduce two weights, w<sub>P</sub> and w<sub>N</sub>, to express the user preference degree for NSPs and PSPs, respectively, and select useful NSPs by a weighted support wsup.

Unlike the conventional AHP, the modified AHP allows us to process quantitative factors that are ranking outcomes of individual gene selection methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test, and signal-to-noise ratio. The IT2FLS is introduced for the classification task due to its great ability for handling nonlinear, noisy, and outlier data, which are common problems in cancer microarray gene expression profiles. An unsupervised learning strategy using the fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to initialize parameters of the IT2FLS. Other classifiers such as multilayer perceptron network, support vector machine, and fuzzy ARTMAP are also implemented for comparisons. Experiments are carried out on three well-known microarray datasets: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer, and prostate. Rather than the traditional cross validation, leave-one-out cross-validation strategy is applied for the experiments. Results demonstrate the performance dominance of the IT2FLS against the competing classifiers. More noticeably, the modified AHP improves the classification performance not only of the IT2FLS but of all other classifiers as well.

Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials.

10.1109/JIOT.2020.3013272,Physical Activity Recognition With Statistical-Deep Fusion Model Using Multiple Sensory Data for Smart Health,IEEE,Journals,"Nowadays, enhancing the living standard with smart healthcare via the Internet of Things is one of the most critical goals of smart cities, in which artificial intelligence plays as the core technology. Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9153758/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Feb.1, 2021",ieeexplore
10.1109/TCBB.2018.2827029,Predicting Hospital Readmission via Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning,IEEE,Journals,"With increased use of electronic medical records (EMRs), data mining on medical data has great potential to improve the quality of hospital treatment and increase the survival rate of patients. Early readmission prediction enables early intervention, which is essential to preventing serious or life-threatening events, and act as a substantial contributor to reduce healthcare costs. Existing works on predicting readmission often focus on certain vital signs and diseases by extracting statistical features. They also fail to consider skewness of class labels in medical data and different costs of misclassification errors. In this paper, we recur to the merits of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn features from time series of vital sign, and categorical feature embedding to effectively encode feature vectors with heterogeneous clinical features, such as demographics, hospitalization history, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and all data is taken from historical EMR databases and reflects the kinds of data that would realistically be available at the clinical prediction system in hospitals. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. For example, using the general hospital wards data for 30-day readmission prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for the proposed model was 0.70, significantly higher than all the baseline methods. Based on these results, a system is being deployed in hospital settings with the proposed forecasting algorithms to support treatment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338085/,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1 Nov.-Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

The successful application of edge computing in the IoT will make our algorithms faster, more convenient, lower overall costs, providing better business practices, and enhance sustainability. Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area. According to the detected facial feature points, we could calculate the values of AU, and then use classification algorithms for emotion recognition. In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production. Therefore, we designed a lightweight edge computing-based distributed system using Raspberry Pi tailed for this need, and we optimized the data transfer and components deployment. In the vicinity, the front-end and back-end processing modes are separated to reduce round-trip delay, thereby completing complex computing tasks and providing high-reliability, large-scale connection services.

However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system to real-time classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological rhythms. Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary events and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a reservoir computing paradigm. An event-driven neuron output layer is then trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally, the filtered activity of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating the presence or absence of a pathological pattern. We validate the approach proposed using a Dynamic Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP) chip, implemented using a standard 180 nm CMOS VLSI process, and present experimental results measured from the chip.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8896021/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems,Dec. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

We trained the resource-efficient oblique tree with power-efficient regularization (ResOT-PE) on three neural classification tasks to evaluate the performance, memory, and hardware requirements. On seizure detection task, we were able to reduce the model size by 3.4× and the feature extraction cost by 14.6× compared to the ensemble of boosted trees, using the intracranial EEG from 10 epilepsy patients.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891970,Semi-Supervised Learning With Deep Embedded Clustering for Image Classification and Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Deep neural networks usually require large labeled datasets to construct accurate models; however, in many real-world scenarios, such as medical image segmentation, labeling data are a time-consuming and costly human (expert) intelligent task. Semi-supervised methods leverage this issue by making use of a small labeled dataset and a larger set of unlabeled data. In this paper, we present a flexible framework for semi-supervised learning that combines the power of supervised methods that learn feature representations using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks with the deeply embedded clustering algorithm that assigns data points to clusters based on their probability distributions and feature representations learned by the networks. Our proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm based on deeply embedded clustering (SSLDEC) learns feature representations via iterations by alternatively using labeled and unlabeled data points and computing target distributions from predictions. During this iterative procedure, the algorithm uses labeled samples to keep the model consistent and tuned with labeling, as it simultaneously learns to improve feature representation and predictions. The SSLDEC requires a few hyper-parameters and thus does not need large labeled validation sets, which addresses one of the main limitations of many semi-supervised learning algorithms. It is also flexible and can be used with many state-of-the-art deep neural network configurations for image classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we implemented and tested our approach on benchmark image classification tasks as well as in a challenging medical image segmentation scenario. In benchmark classification tasks, the SSLDEC outperformed several state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, achieving 0.46% error on MNIST with 1000 labeled points and 4.43% error on SVHN with 500 labeled points. In the iso-intense infant brain MRI tissue segmentation task, we implemented SSLDEC on a 3D densely connected fully convolutional neural network where we achieved significant improvement over supervised-only training as well as a semi-supervised method based on pseudo-labeling. Our results show that the SSLDEC can be effectively used to reduce the need for costly expert annotations, enhancing applications, such as automatic medical image segmentation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8606090/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Firstly, the spatial-temporal features of the video are extracted by the constructed multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network. Then the scene background is modeled by the high-dimensional mixed Gaussian model and used for anomaly detection. Finally, the accurate position of anomalous behavior in the video data is achieved by calculating the position of the last output feature, that is, the position of the receptive field.

A practical approach to this problem is particularly difficult to implement, not only because the shape variability of relevant object classes is generally large, but also because standard sensing devices used to capture the real world only provide a partial view of a scene, so there is partial information pertaining to the objects of interest. In this work, we develop an algorithmic framework for recognizing classes of deformable shapes from range data. The basic idea of our component-based approach is to generalize existing surface representations that have proven effective in recognizing specific 3D objects to the problem of object classes using our newly introduced symbolic-signature representation that is robust to deformations, as opposed to a numeric representation that is often tied to a specific shape. Based on this approach, we present a system that is capable of recognizing and classifying a variety of object shape classes from range data.

The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models.

Unlike still images, video images contain many color shifts, blurs, reflections, and so on, a classification method that takes these noises into account is indispensable. In this paper, in the framework of Bag-of-Feature (BoF), we use a pre-learned convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with general images as feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification. A robust classification method for endoscopic video is proposed by relearning SVM with several sets of endoscopic images. In addition, since CNN and SVM need to perform many multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operations, we implement the hardware system on a customizable DSP, which can be realize at high speed MAC operations and parallel processing with Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW). The prototyped system can be achieved real-time processing on video frame rate (30 fps @ 200 MHz).

ESD is a form of skin disease. It generally causes redness of the skin and also may cause loss of skin. They are generally due to genetic or environmental factors. ESD comprises six classes of skin conditions namely, pityriasis rubra pilaris, lichen planus, chronic dermatitis, psoriasis, seboreic dermatitis and pityriasis rosea. The automated diagnosis of ESD can help doctors and dermatologists in reducing the efforts from their end and in taking faster decisions for treatment. The literature is replete with works that used conventional machine learning methods for the diagnosis of ESD. However, there isn't much instances of application of Deep learning for the diagnosis of ESD. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning approach i.e. Derm2Vec for the diagnosis of the ESD. Derm2Vec is a hybrid deep learning model that consists of both Autoencoders and Deep Neural Networks. We also apply a conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the classification of ESD. We apply both Derm2Vec and DNN along with other traditional machine learning methods on a real world dermatology dataset. The Derm2Vec method is found to be the best performer (when taking the prediction accuracy into account) followed by DNN and Extreme Gradient Boosting.The mean CV score of Derm2Vec, DNN and Extreme Gradient Boosting are 96.92%, 96.65% and 95.80% respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9198447/,"2020 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)",2-4 July 2020,ieeexplore

The FusaHum graminearum Sehw., special fugus always damages the wheat ear, and produces vomitoxin,is difficult to control and prevent, and seriously threatens the health of humans, animals and China's food security. Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display. The Service-Terminal was completed by the mixed programming of Myeclipse and Matlab software, and Tomcat was used as the Server. It mainly implements the functions of image receiving, image preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier modeling. The MySQL was used to establish two databases: the “Disease Characteristics Database” and the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base”. Finally, through samples testing and validating, the Android-based mobile terminal can real-time collect the image of Fusarium head blight and upload the server. After the target image was processed and compared by the “Disease Characteristics Database”, the appropriate diagnostic knowledge was selected from the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base” and feedbacked to the client.

And the situation is exacerbated by the properties of velocity, variety and volume (3Vs) of big data. To recovery the system from performance anomaly, the first step is to find the root causes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature-based performance diagnosis approach to rapidly pinpoint the root causes of performance problems in big data platforms. The performance diagnosis is formalized as a pattern recognition problem. We leverage Maximum Information Criterion (MIC) to express the invariant relationships amongst the performance metrics in the normal state. Each performance problem occurred in the big data platform is signified by a unique binary vector named signature, which consists of a set of violations of MIC invariants. The signatures of multiple performance problems form a signature database. If the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the big data application exhibits model drift, our approach can identify the real culprits by retrieving the root causes which have similar signatures to the current performance problem. Moreover, considering the diversity of big data applications, we establish an ensemble approach to treat each application separately. The experiment evaluations in a controlled big data platform show that our approach can pinpoint the real culprits of performance problems in an average 84% precision and 87% recall when one fault occurs, which is better than several state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359155/,2018 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE),26-29 March 2018,ieeexplore

Compared with traditional methods, fault diagnosis method based on deep learning could approximate complex non-linear relationship and achieve very high precision under the same load. However, the performance of these deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods will be greatly reduced when the load changes, which are significant in fault diagnosis issues since the working load is changing all the time in real world industrial applications. Thus, a fault diagnosis method based on multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to solve this problem. CNN is a type of neural network which can extract feature from the fault signal directly. In order to obtain sufficient fault information, the proposed method uses multi-scale convolution kernels to extract features of different scales. In addition, dropout is also added to the network to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model. The experimental results show that the proposed model not only performs well under the same load, but also achieves high fault diagnosis accuracy when the load changes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9084876/,"2020 IEEE 4th Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)",12-14 June 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICATCCT.2016.7912031,Bearing fault diagnosis using discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Rotating machinery has vast industrial applications in fields of petroleum, automotive, HVAC and food processing. Rotating machineries use bearings to perform rotational or linear movement of various subcomponents while reducing friction and stress. Compared other types of bearing, REBs offer a good balance of key attributes like friction, lifetime, stiffness, speed and cost. Hence, real-time monitoring and diagnosis of bearings is crucial to prevent failures, improve safety, avoid unforeseen downtime of production assembly lines and lower cost. We propose an approach based on Wavelet Transform and ANN for analysis of vibration signals from a rolling element bearing to identify and multi-classify its component defects. The vibration signals from the REB being analyzed are passed over to the software setup consisting of Wavelet Transform and ANN. To remove noise and extract the relevant features from this signal, we pass the vibration signal through a Wavelet transform. These features are retrieved using time domain parameters like Skewness, Kurtosis, RMS and Crest Factor and they are used as an input for ANN classifier. The role of the ANN is to classify the bearing fault features produced by the Wavelet Transform and identify bearing faults, if any. To this end, we have designed a feedforward topology ANN using the sigmoid transfer function. The ANN training methodology uses three learning paradigms - namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient Back-propogation and Scaled Conjugate method. The learning models generated by each algorithm are tested to find the one which gives better accuracy. The outcome of this experiment indicates that DWT and ANN can together achieve good accuracy and reliability in detection and classification of bearing faults.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7912031/,2016 2nd International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Computing and Communication Technology (iCATccT),21-23 July 2016,ieeexplore

However, current diagnosis depends on dozens of factors, including the family member, past medical problems, tests of memory, blood and urine tests, brain scans and even cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Among them, regular features (e.g., blood and urine tests, brain scans) are simple and accurate. Privileged features (e.g., tests of memory, cerebrospinal fluid specimens) are inconvenient and uncomfortable to acquire, and thus incomplete in most cases. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to predict merely using the regular feature with the aid of incomplete privileged data in the training time. In particular, we first complement the missing data of privileged features by exploring the relationship with regular features and labels. The recovered privileged features, regular features, as well as labels, are combined as a new set of privileged features. Then privileged learning via matching logits is applied to boost the diagnosis accuracy.

The estimations made by recently published data found that lung cancer deaths will increase from 1.6 million in 2012 to 3 million in 2035. This is mainly because most cases are still diagnosed in advanced stages, leading to considerably low survival rates. Therefore, urgent strategies are necessary to facilitate early diagnosis or improve current diagnosis techniques. Due to late detection, only approximately 15% of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary cancer are able to survive for a longer period of time, however, the survival rate increases considerably if the cancer is detected in its early stages. In this paper we aim to develop a software application able to accurately and non-invasively aid physicians for lung tumors differential diagnosis and biopsy guidance based on ultrasound image processing and neural networks.

Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault and Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: (1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; (2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures.

Majority of the faults which occur in induction motors are mainly diagnosed using motor current signature analysis. However, the accuracy of fault detection depends on selection of suitable features from motor current, the failure of which may result in incorrect interpretation. Considering the aforesaid fact, this paper presents an image processing aided deep learning framework for reliable diagnosis of induction motor faults, which eliminates the need of separate feature extraction stage. To this end, the motor current signals under different types of fault conditions were procured and were subsequently processed into frequency occurrence plots. The frequency occurrence image plots for different fault scenarios were finally used as inputs to a deep convolution neural network for the purpose of classification. Transfer learning technique was adopted to reduce the computation time of Convolution Neural Network and classification of motor faults was done at five different loading conditions. Four types of classification tasks have been addressed here and comprehensive analysis was done using a variety of CNN architectures.

Incoherent mapping repair will restore the incoherent to coherent condition in mapping, by removing unwanted mapping. The process of removing unwanted mapping to restore the coherent condition is called diagnosis process. Since mappings are very important sources to support data integration and exchange, then diagnosis should be done as minimal as possible. We propose two focuses minimal using global new technique to repair the incoherent mapping.

These include a power spectral density estimate, and two discrete wavelets, the Daubechies wavelet of order 10 (db 10) and the Symlet wavelet of order 8 (sym8) applied to a single beat of the X, Y and Z Frank leads. Simple statistical parameters derived from these transforms and from reconstructed filtered signals were used as inputs to a neural network with no hidden units and a softmax output stage. We used multiple runs of 10 fold cross validation to obtain estimates of classifier performance. Best results were obtained for the db 10 parameters when age and sex were also added. Overall accuracy was 68.8/spl plusmn/0.6%. These results are comparable to those derived from neural nets trained with over 229 scalar parameters (70.9/spl plusmn/0.6%) and were derived at much lower computational cost.

The running status of radars are consecutively recorded in time series to monitor the status of different channels. However, due to the large sum of data, the status data is not rigorously used to diagnose possible radar faults. Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data. Based on the assumption that anomaly deviates from normal data, the time periods with large prediction error can be recognized as faults. We also apply a dynamic thresholding method to automatically determine the threshold of the anomaly.

Existing studies of failure diagnosis based on log messages tend to use rule-based methods or execution-path-based methods. Rule-based methods generate bug-fixing rules using either human expertise, which is time consuming, or machine learning methods, which may lack the precision of failure diagnosis. To remedy these problems, researchers propose execution-path-based methods that reconstruct execution paths by analyzing source code and run-time logs. These methods, however, may lead to path explosion. To fill this gap, our work focuses on solving the path explosion problem in execution-path-based methods. We assume that run-time logs may have a relationship with their corresponding patches in real-world bug reports. We conduct empirical studies on seven open-source software packages and obtain two findings: (1) 80% of similar bugs have similar patches, and (2) 70% of faulty code is found to lie near the code where the first failure message is printed. Based on these two observations, we design and implement a practical tool NotOnlyLog for bug diagnosis. NotOnlyLog is able to mine the relationships between failure logs and their corresponding patches, in order to reduce both the number and length of uncertain execution paths in bug diagnosis. We evaluate the performance of NotOnlyLog on nine real-world bugs from three large open-source projects.

We consider some methods for pre-processing the acoustic signal, generated by a rolling mill process, for fault detection and structural classification. The pre-processing methods are based on artificial neural networks. The methods refer to: signal decomposition algorithms, a distances measure for spectral amplitude classification and neural network structures for spectrum compression. For the signal decomposition problem an adaptive neural network algorithm is proposed in which the number of inputs is adapted to the imposed error. When the training error for two successive steps is very little, then the number of inputs in network is increased. If the spectral components are zero for sufficient time, then the number of inputs is decreased. The Hausdorff distance is proposed for spectrum classification as the distance measure for the frequency domain in a pattern recognition context. It shown that the Hausdorff distance has a monotone relationship with the signal-to-noise-ratio. Finally, the possibility of decreasing the number of spectrum components as patterns is presented, by compression with neural networks. Spectral representations of the acoustic source show that signatures collected at rolling mill sensor locations can be successfully used to identify process and structural changes in the rolling mill monitoring system.

The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line past-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the case of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, hypothesis resting on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts.

Third, the relative residual values are used to implement quantitative diagnosis of HGU using weighted fuzzy set theory.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults. We include an analysis and discussion of ADTM's performance on several of these fault cases. We conclude with a brief discussion of future work, which contains investigation of a hierarchical SOM-architecture as well as a Case-Based Reasoning module for further assisting astronauts in diagnosis and remediation activities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172454/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/DASC.2012.6382418,Semi-supervised learning of decision making for parts faults to system-level failures diagnosis in avionics system,IEEE,Conferences,"Supervised fault detection and fault diagnosis are the techniques for recognizing small faults with abrupt or incipient time behavior in closed loops. Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system. The presented structure is generic and can be extended to the verification and validation of other diagnosis and prognostic algorithms on different platforms.

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device.

Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way.

However, the wide applications of this scheme are generally compromised in real-world conditions because of the discrepancy between the training data and testing data. Although the recently emerging transfer fault diagnosis can learn transferable features from relevant source data and adapt the diagnostic model to the target data, these methods still only work on the target domain with a priori data distribution. The generalization capability of the transferred model cannot be guaranteed for unseen domains. Since the working conditions of machinery are varying during operation, the generalization capability of the diagnosis methods is crucial in this case. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a domain generalization-based hybrid diagnosis network for deploying to unseen working conditions. The main idea is to regularize the discriminant structure of the deep network with both intrinsic and extrinsic generalization objectives such that the diagnostic model can learn robust features and generalize to unseen domains. The triplet loss minimization of intrinsic multisource data is implemented to facilitate the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability at the class level, leading to a more generalized decision boundary. The extrinsic domain-level regularization is achieved by using adversarial training to further reduce the risk of overfitting.

Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller.

The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS. The designed system considers the ontology semantic similarity of diabetes complications and symptoms concepts in the fuzzy rules' evaluation process. The framework was tested using a real data set, and the results indicate how the proposed system helps physicians and patients to accurately diagnose diabetes mellitus.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8403911/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

This work presents an innovative method for a recommendation system for the diagnosis of breast cancer using patient medical histories. In this proposal, techniques of natural language processing (NLP) were implemented on real datasets: one comprised 160, 560 medical histories of anonymous patients from a hospital in Chile for the following categories: breast cancer, cysts and nodules, other cancer, breast cancer surgeries and other diagnoses; and the other dataset was obtained from the MIMIC III dataset. With the application of word-embedding techniques, such as word2vec's skip-gram and BERT, and machine learning techniques, a recommendation system as a tool to support the physician's decision-making was implemented. The obtained results demonstrate that using word embeddings can define a good-quality recommendation system.

The task is challenging owing to shortage and ineffectiveness of clinical testing kits. However, the existing problems can be improved by employing computational intelligent techniques on radiological images like CT-Scans (Computed Tomography) of lungs. Extensive research has been reported using deep learning models to diagnose the severity of COVID-19 from CT images. This has undoubtedly minimized the manual involvement in abnormality identification but reported detection accuracy is limited.

However, since EEG signals are highly complex, nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, both visual inspection and the existing computed aid detection approaches fail to capture the intrinsic dynamics of seizure events, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. Therefore, an accurate computer-aided automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis system is valuable and urgently needed in clinical application. In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%.

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax.

The performance of these activities can be fundamental for achieving a business objective, but they also imply the assumption of certain security risks that might go against a company's security policies. A risk may be defined as the effects of uncertainty on the achievement of the goals of a company, some of which can be associated with security aspects (e.g., data corruption or data leakage). The execution of the activities can be choreographed using business processes models, in which the risk of the entire business process model derives from a combination of the single activity risks (executed in an isolated manner). In this paper, a risk assessment method is proposed to enable the analysis and evaluation of a set of activities combined in a business process model to ascertain whether the model conforms to the security-risk objectives. To achieve this objective, we use a business process extension with security-risk information to: 1) define an algorithm to verify the level of risk of process models; 2) design an algorithm to diagnose the risk of the activities that fail to conform to the level of risk established in security-risk objectives; and 3) the implementation of a tool that supports the described proposal.

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection.

The intelligent fault diagnosis method has been widely used to accurately diagnose bearing faults. However, in engineering practice, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sample data to train the intelligent diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a fusion diagnosis model CGAN-2-D-CNN that combines a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis with small samples. Considering the problem of insufficient sample data, CGAN is used to learn the data distribution of real samples to generate new samples with similar data distribution by the confrontation training of the generator and discriminator. Then, 2-D preprocessing is conducted to convert the generated 1-D data into 2-D gray images. Finally, these images are input into the 2-D-CNN to extract the features and classify the bearing fault types. Two experimental cases are implemented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CGAN-2-D-CNN. The experimental results illustrate that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method used on the small sample data is close to that of the 2-D-CNN directly used on the enough original sample data whose size is equal to the expanded sample size.

Machine learning-based methods are increasingly being used for fault diagnosis applications. However, the performance of such detection algorithms will degrade because of variations between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation of the field. Furthermore, the fault's data in the target domain for model training are usually not available. In this paper, domain adaptation combined with deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN)-based methodology is proposed, where DA-DCGAN first learns an intelligent normal-to-arcing transformation from the source-domain data.

In designing reliable cellular networks, it is essential to predict spectrum saturation events in the future by analyzing the past behavior of base stations, especially their frequency resource block (RB) utilization states. This paper investigates a deep learning-based forecasting strategy of the future RB usage rate (RBUR) status of hundreds of LTE base stations deployed in Seoul, South Korea. The dataset consists of real measurement RBUR samples with a randomly varying number of base stations at each measurement time. This poses a difficulty in handling variable-length RBUR data vectors, which is not trivial for state-of-the-art deep learning estimation models, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), developed for handling fixed-length inputs. To this end, we propose a two-step RBUR estimation approach. In the first step, we extract a useful feature of the RBUR dataset that accurately approximates the behavior of the top quantile base stations. The feature parameters are carefully designed to be fixed-length vectors regardless of the dimensions of the raw RBUR samples. The fixed-length feature parameter vectors are readily exploited as the training dataset of RNN-based prediction models. Thus, in the second step, we propose a feature estimation strategy where the RNN is trained to predict the future RBUR from the input feature parameter sequences. With the estimated RBUR at hand, we can easily predict the spectrum saturation of the future LTE systems by examining the resource utilization states of the top quantile base stations.

However, in many cases the collected data may be incomplete or inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or unformulated. In this paper, we develop an innovative cognitive fault diagnosis framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation. This paper also theoretically investigates how to measure the pairwise distance between two models in the model space and incorporates the model distance into the learning algorithm in the model space. The results on three benchmark applications and one simulated model for the Barcelona water distribution network confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6515601/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Jan. 2014,ieeexplore

Proposed methodology is addressed with relying on PMSG (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator) stator current signals, which is already being used by protection system of wind turbines. According to the aforementioned description, non-stationary current signals of PMSG have been pre-processed to extract the input features by empirical mode decomposition followed with J48 algorithm based most relevant input feature selection. For the one-step ahead performance demonstration of the proposed MFQL approach, results have been compared with neural network, support vector machines, fuzzy logic, and conventional Fuzzy-Q-Learning techniques.

However, many of existing DL methods fail in relationship mining between signals explicitly. Unlike those deep neural networks, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) taking graph data with topological structure as input is more efficient for data relationship mining, making GCN to be powerful for feature representation from graph data in non-Euclidean space. Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation. To address these issues, a multireceptive field graph convolutional network (MRF-GCN) is proposed for effective intelligent fault diagnosis. In MRF-GCN, data samples are converted into weighted graphs to indicate differences in relationship of data samples. Moreover, MRF-GCN learns not only features from different receptive field, but also fuses learned features as an enhanced feature representation. To verify the efficacy of MRF-GCN for machine fault diagnosis, case studies are implemented, and the results show that MRF-GCN can achieve superior performance even under imbalanced dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280401/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

Such performance variations can lead to failures and inefficiencies, which impact the cost and resilience of HPC systems. To minimize the impact of performance variations, one must quickly and accurately detect and diagnose the anomalies that cause the variations and take mitigating actions. However, it is difficult to identify anomalies based on the voluminous, high-dimensional, and noisy data collected by system monitoring infrastructures. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to automatically diagnose performance anomalies at runtime. Our framework leverages historical resource usage data to extract signatures of previously-observed anomalies. We first convert collected time series data into easy-to-compute statistical features. We then identify the features that are required to detect anomalies, and extract the signatures of these anomalies. At runtime, we use these signatures to diagnose anomalies with negligible overhead. We evaluate our framework using experiments on a real-world HPC supercomputer and demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies 98 percent of injected anomalies and consistently outperforms existing anomaly diagnosis techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466019/,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1 April 2019,ieeexplore

Regarding cloud computing, data-driven methods running at clouds are adopted to train the model with a large amount of raw data at the beginning, then end machines upload their real-time readings to the cloud center for processing. However, this incurs considerable computational costs and may sometimes bear a severe delay. In this article, we consider a hierarchical structure where edge-PLCs are employed to gather sensed data locally and reduce communication costs. Since a single fault may be related to multiple influencing features, we want to first minimize the number of features that need to determine a fault, then try to find out the minimal set of edge-PLCs which can cover all key features so as to save the deployment cost. We propose a random-forest-based method to handle the features selection problem, and then the selection of edge-PLCs by solving the set coverage problem.

However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings. Experimental results on the benchmark tasks show that PKRLS obtains a parsimonious network structure with the satisfactory prediction accuracy. Finally, a multi-sensor health diagnosis approach based on PKRLS is developed for identifying the health state of a degraded aero-engine in realtime.

The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into an expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line post-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the ease of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, continuous hypothesis testing on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.142,7A-4 A New Method for Enhancing Dynamic Vascular Patterns of Focal Liver Lesions in Contrast Ultrasound,IEEE,Conferences,"The differential diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLL) frequently presents a dilemma, as FLL cannot be reliably characterized with conventional ultrasound. Recently, ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) and contrast-specific imaging methods have substantially improved the characterization of FLL. This was made possible by the known differences in dynamic vascular patterns (DVP) between healthy parenchyma and various FLL types, revealed by UCA. The purpose of this work was to develop a new method, called DVP processing, which provides a DVP-enhanced imaging mode of FLL using contrast ultrasound; this mode allows an improved differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. DVP processing consists in generating a sequence of images, where hyper-echoic and hypo- echoic pixels, compared to reference levels taken in healthy parenchyma, are coded over time in warm and cold colors, respectively. For example, a benign lesion remains hyper-echoic over time, while a malignant lesion is hyper-echoic in the arterial phase and turns into hypo-echoic in the portal phase. This method was implemented as an image-processing software program, which was the object of clinical evaluation. Sequences of 111 FLL were acquired with real-time low-MI contrast- specific ultrasound after a 2.5-mL bolus injection of SonoVuetrade, and subsequently analyzed off-fine with DVP processing. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by two clinical observers in this way were 92%, and 86%, respectively. These results reflect a significant improvement over accuracy scores achieved with contrast-enhanced ultrasound alone, having resulted in 93% and 82% in sensitivity and specificity, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4409715/,2007 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings,28-31 Oct. 2007,ieeexplore

Vestibular disorders and their complications have become one of the most common health problems worldwide. Patients with vestibular disorders not only feel uncomfortable in daily living but also have higher risk of stroke. Because of the popularity of vestibular disorders, a good screening method can significantly save resources for hospitals and society. Currently, there are three vestibular disorder diagnostic methods including hearing tests, eye movement tests, and balance tests. The first two methods are sensitive and accurate.

Finally, specially combined morphological operations are designed as a post processor to remove noise and to delineate the liver. Our unique contributions to liver segmentation are twofold: one is that it has been proved through experiments that wavelet features present better classification than Haralick texture descriptors when SVMs are used; the other is that the combination of morphological operations with a pixel-wised SVM classifier can delineate volumetric liver accurately. The algorithm can be used in an advanced computer-aided liver disease diagnosis and surgical planning systems.

10.1109/BRACIS.2016.076,A Meta-Learning Method to Select Under-Sampling Algorithms for Imbalanced Data Sets,IEEE,Conferences,"Imbalanced data sets originating from real world problems, such as medical diagnosis, can be found pervasive. Learning from imbalanced data sets poses its own challenges, as common classifiers assume a balanced distribution of examples' classes in the data. Sampling techniques overcome the imbalance in the data by modifying the examples' classes distribution. Unfortunately, selecting a sampling technique together with its parameters is still an open problem. Current solutions include the brute-force approach (try as many techniques as possible), and the random search approach (choose the most appropriate from a random subset of techniques). In this work, we propose a new method to select sampling techniques for imbalanced data sets. It uses Meta-Learning and works by recommending a technique for an imbalanced data set based on solutions to previous problems. Our experimentation compared the proposed method against the brute-force approach, all techniques with their default parameters, and the random search approach. The results of our experimentation show that the proposed method is comparable to the brute-force approach, outperforms the techniques with their default parameters most of the time, and always surpasses the random search approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7839617/,2016 5th Brazilian Conference on Intelligent Systems (BRACIS),9-12 Oct. 2016,ieeexplore

The FusaHum graminearum Sehw., special fugus always damages the wheat ear, and produces vomitoxin,is difficult to control and prevent, and seriously threatens the health of humans, animals and China's food security. Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display. The Service-Terminal was completed by the mixed programming of Myeclipse and Matlab software, and Tomcat was used as the Server. It mainly implements the functions of image receiving, image preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier modeling. The MySQL was used to establish two databases: the “Disease Characteristics Database” and the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base”. Finally, through samples testing and validating, the Android-based mobile terminal can real-time collect the image of Fusarium head blight and upload the server. After the target image was processed and compared by the “Disease Characteristics Database”, the appropriate diagnostic knowledge was selected from the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base” and feedbacked to the client.

In this review, we cover the landscape of attacks targeting the confidentiality of embedded DNN models that may have a major impact on critical IoT systems, with a particular focus on model extraction and data leakage.

The paper discusses the potential for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into an application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for condition monitoring. The paper is a continuation of the work presented by the authors at the IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference in Calgary. The proposed asset management system analyses condition monitoring (CM) data and assesses the risk of failure data across complete HV networks. Knowledge of deteriorating asset condition provides the operator with an advanced, early warning of incipient mechanical and electrical faults. With knowledge of the severity and source of such faults, pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions can then made during planned maintenance outages. The complete HV network asset monitoring solution described includes permanent sensors and monitoring nodes deployed at strategic locations across the network. Processed data is passed via a local area network to local servers and then via secure data cloud transmission to a centralized monitoring server located at the CM headquarters. This central server operates a CM database that logs, displays, benchmarks and trends the condition data with comparison to a statistically-significant database of measurements. It is proposed in the IIoT solution proposed that this database will be downloadable to a smartphone/tablet for use by the field engineer. The monitoring technology will likely also incorporate a number of AI machine learning software modules for the de-noising of raw signals and the diagnosis of different types of defects within different types of HV plant items. The proposed SMART CM system includes an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing HV asset CM data along with operational and maintenance (O&amp;M) data. The GUI will also be able to display both condition criticality and operational criticality (on a color-coded range of 0-100%) for individual HV plant items on a digitized mimic of the HV network's single-line diagram (SLD). This could also be combined with geometric positioning data of assets across the facility (including HV cable routes and lengths) to provide a fully digitized SMART network diagram for use in the IIoT asset management solution. Asset management data, combined with the application of the developing techniques of AI, AR and VR, will greatly help the user to visualize the plant items in 3-D, their position within the network, their condition and operational criticality along with all related asset management information together on one dashboard screen, downloaded onto smartphone/tablet.

Subjective segmentations are widely adopted in clinical diagnosis and treating, but they are neither accurate nor reliable. An automatical and objective system for brain tumor segmentation is strongly expected. But they are still facing some challenges such as lower segmentation accuracy, demanding a priori knowledge or requiring the human intervention. In this paper, a novel and new coarse-to-fine method is proposed to segment the brain tumor. This hierarchical framework consists of preprocessing, deep learning network based classification and post-processing. The preprocessing is used to extract image patches for each MR image and obtains the gray level sequences of image patches as the input of the deep learning network. The deep learning network based classification is implemented by a stacked auto-encoder network to extract the high level abstract feature from the input, and utilizes the extracted feature to classify image patches. After mapping the classification result to a binary image, the post-processing is implemented by a morphological filter to get the final segmentation result. In order to evaluate the proposed method, the experiment was applied to segment the brain tumor for the real patient dataset.

This reference architecture organises the monitoring and diagnosis functions in a modified hierarchical manner with multiple levels, and is therefore easily scalable to meet growing requirements of different application scenarios. The architecture is efficient as it allows problems to be quickly dealt with closer to their sources; therefore minimising intra-level data communication and messaging. Similarly the proposed functional model for monitoring and diagnosis unit can be adopted (i.e., scaled up or down) to suit the needs of the application, and indeed it fits well into the proposed reference architecture.

Decentralization/distributed solutions can solve some of these problems (Goldszmidt, G. and Yemini, Y., 1995), and thus there is considerable interest in distributed/decentralized network management applications. We present the design and evaluation of an SNMP-based distributed network fault detection/monitoring system. We integrate into the SNMP framework our ML-ADSD algorithm (Su, M.-S. et al., Proc. 39th Annual Allerton Conf. on Commun., Control, and Computers, 2001; Su, ""Multilevel distributed diagnosis and the design of a distributed network fault detection system based on the SNMP protocol"", Ph.D. Thesis, School of Computer Science, University of Oklahoma, 2002) for fault diagnosis in a distributed processor system. The algorithm uses the multilevel paradigm and requires only minor modifications to be scalable to networks of varying sizes. The system is fault tolerant, allowing processor failure and/or recovery during the diagnosis process. We have implemented the system on an Ethernet network of 32 machines. Our results show that the diagnosis latency (or time to termination) is much better than that of earlier solutions. Also, the system's bandwidth utilization is insignificant, demonstrating the practicality of its deployment in a real network.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

And the situation is exacerbated by the properties of velocity, variety and volume (3Vs) of big data. To recovery the system from performance anomaly, the first step is to find the root causes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature-based performance diagnosis approach to rapidly pinpoint the root causes of performance problems in big data platforms. The performance diagnosis is formalized as a pattern recognition problem. We leverage Maximum Information Criterion (MIC) to express the invariant relationships amongst the performance metrics in the normal state. Each performance problem occurred in the big data platform is signified by a unique binary vector named signature, which consists of a set of violations of MIC invariants. The signatures of multiple performance problems form a signature database. If the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the big data application exhibits model drift, our approach can identify the real culprits by retrieving the root causes which have similar signatures to the current performance problem. Moreover, considering the diversity of big data applications, we establish an ensemble approach to treat each application separately. The experiment evaluations in a controlled big data platform show that our approach can pinpoint the real culprits of performance problems in an average 84% precision and 87% recall when one fault occurs, which is better than several state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359155/,2018 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE),26-29 March 2018,ieeexplore

Such complex workflows are dynamic, exhibit periodic patterns, and combine diverse task groupings and requirements. In this work, we propose ANANKE, a scheduling system addressing these challenges. Our approach extends the state-of-the-art in portfolio scheduling for data centers with a reinforcement-learning technique, and proposes various scheduling policies for managing complex workflows. Portfolio scheduling addresses the dynamic aspect of the workload. Q-learning, allows our approach to adapt to the periodic patterns of the workload, and to tune the other configuration parameters. The proposed policies are heuristics that guide the provisioning process, and map workflow tasks to the provisioned cloud resources.

10.1109/ICPHM.2019.8819421,Application of Deep Learning for Fault Diagnostic in Induction Machine’s Bearings,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent developments in sensor technologies and advances in communication systems have resulted in deployment of a large number of sensors for collecting condition monitoring (CM) data in order to monitor health condition of a manufac-tring/industrial system. Efficient utilization of sensory data leads to highly accurate results in system fault diagnostics/prognostics. The exponential growth of CM data poses significant analytical challenges, due to their high variety, high dimensionality and high velocity rendering conventional health monitoring tools impractical. In this regard, the paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for fault diagnosis of an induction machine's bearing based on real data set provided by Case Western Reserve University bearing data center. In particular, we focus on deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BiD-LSTM) networks fed with raw signals for fault diagnosis to address drawbacks of conventional machine learning (ML) solutions such as support vector machines. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the complete procedure of the proposed framework, which shows the great potentials of the BiD-LSTM for detection of different types of the bearing fault with high accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through a comparison with a recently developed deep neural network (DNN) that considers temporal coherence for the same data set.

One of the most popular scheme is the model-based fault diagnostic. Recently, artificial intelligence techniques have been found to be suitable for fault detection and diagnosis and a variety of techniques have been proposed in this area. However, only few applications and real time implementation of the schemes have been reported. In this paper, we use a fault detection and diagnostic scheme based on the model-based approach using parameter estimation and fuzzy inference and experimented it on a DC motor servo trainer. The model of the plant is obtained using the recursive least squares parameter estimation technique, and fuzzy inference is used for the interpretation of the fault.

Physicians make diagnoses by visual examination of ECGs. Analysing huge amounts of ECGs however, can be very time consuming and cumbersome. Hence, developing analytic software is of great importance to automatically analyse these ECG signals to detect efficiently the common cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: Proposed an ensemble learning approach for automatic processing of ECG signals and classification of arrhythmias. Twenty six features (based on wavelets, heartbeat intervals, and RR-intervals) are extracted and three algorithms, namely, Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are utilized for classification. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on ECG signals from 44 recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

The automatic segmentation of psoriasis lesions is a challenging task in the field of computer vision.

Compared with traditional methods, fault diagnosis method based on deep learning could approximate complex non-linear relationship and achieve very high precision under the same load. However, the performance of these deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods will be greatly reduced when the load changes, which are significant in fault diagnosis issues since the working load is changing all the time in real world industrial applications. Thus, a fault diagnosis method based on multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to solve this problem. CNN is a type of neural network which can extract feature from the fault signal directly. In order to obtain sufficient fault information, the proposed method uses multi-scale convolution kernels to extract features of different scales. In addition, dropout is also added to the network to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the model.

Rotating machineries use bearings to perform rotational or linear movement of various subcomponents while reducing friction and stress. Compared other types of bearing, REBs offer a good balance of key attributes like friction, lifetime, stiffness, speed and cost. Hence, real-time monitoring and diagnosis of bearings is crucial to prevent failures, improve safety, avoid unforeseen downtime of production assembly lines and lower cost. We propose an approach based on Wavelet Transform and ANN for analysis of vibration signals from a rolling element bearing to identify and multi-classify its component defects. The vibration signals from the REB being analyzed are passed over to the software setup consisting of Wavelet Transform and ANN. To remove noise and extract the relevant features from this signal, we pass the vibration signal through a Wavelet transform. These features are retrieved using time domain parameters like Skewness, Kurtosis, RMS and Crest Factor and they are used as an input for ANN classifier. The role of the ANN is to classify the bearing fault features produced by the Wavelet Transform and identify bearing faults, if any. To this end, we have designed a feedforward topology ANN using the sigmoid transfer function. The ANN training methodology uses three learning paradigms - namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient Back-propogation and Scaled Conjugate method. The learning models generated by each algorithm are tested to find the one which gives better accuracy.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples.

However, current diagnosis depends on dozens of factors, including the family member, past medical problems, tests of memory, blood and urine tests, brain scans and even cerebrospinal fluid specimens. Among them, regular features (e.g., blood and urine tests, brain scans) are simple and accurate. Privileged features (e.g., tests of memory, cerebrospinal fluid specimens) are inconvenient and uncomfortable to acquire, and thus incomplete in most cases. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework to predict merely using the regular feature with the aid of incomplete privileged data in the training time. In particular, we first complement the missing data of privileged features by exploring the relationship with regular features and labels. The recovered privileged features, regular features, as well as labels, are combined as a new set of privileged features.

10.1109/ICCCS49078.2020.9118497,CT Image Super Resolution Based On Improved SRGAN,IEEE,Conferences,"CT images are commonly used in medical clinical diagnosis. However, due to factors such as hardware and scanning time, CT images in real scenes are limited by spatial resolution so that doctors cannot perform accurate disease analysis on tiny lesion areas and pathological features. An image super-resolution (SR) method based on deep learning is a good way to solve this problem. Although many excellent networks have been proposed, but they all pay more attention to image quality indicators than image visual perception quality. Unlike other networks that focus more on image evaluation metrics, the super resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) has achieved tremendous improvements in image perception quality. Based on the above, this paper proposes a CT image super-resolution algorithm based on improved SRGAN. In order to improve the visual quality of CT images, a dilated convolution module is introduced. At the same time, in order to improve the overall visual effect of the image, the mean structural similarity (MSSIM) loss is also introduced to improve the perceptual loss function. Experimental results on the public CT image dataset demonstrate that our model is better than the baseline method SRGAN not only in mean opinion score(MOS), but also in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) values.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9118497/,2020 5th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS),15-18 May 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00118,Cognified Distributed Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Cognification - the act of transforming ordinary objects or processes into their intelligent counterparts through Data Science and Artificial Intelligence - is a disruptive technology that has been revolutionizing disparate fields ranging from corporate law to medical diagnosis. Easy access to massive data sets, data analytics tools and High-Performance Computing (HPC) have been fueling this revolution. In many ways, cognification is similar to the electrification revolution that took place more than a century ago when electricity became a ubiquitous commodity that could be accessed with ease from anywhere in order to transform mechanical processes into their electrical counterparts. In this paper, we consider two particular forms of distributed computing - Data Centers and HPC systems - and argue that they are ripe for cognification of their entire ecosystem, ranging from top-level applications down to low-level resource and power management services. We present our vision for what ""Cognified Distributed Computing"" might look like and outline some of the challenges that need to be addressed and new technologies that need to be developed in order to make it a reality. In particular, we examine the role cognification can play in tackling power consumption, resiliency and management problems in these systems. We describe intelligent software-based solutions to these problems powered by on-line predictive models built from streamed real-time data. While we cast the problem and our solutions in the context of large Data Centers and HPC systems, we believe our approach to be applicable to distributed computing in general. We believe that the traditional systems research agenda has much to gain by crossing discipline boundaries to include ideas and techniques from Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8416381/,2018 IEEE 38th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),2-6 July 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/IEEE.ICCC.2017.20,Cognitive Acoustic Analytics Service for Internet of Things,IEEE,Conferences,"The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought great changes for non-contact and non-destructive sensing and diagnosis. For every inanimate object can tell us something by the sound it makes, acoustic sensor demonstrates great advantages comparing to conventional electronic and mechanic sensors in such cases: overcoming environmental obstacles, mapping to existing use cases of detecting problems with human ears, low cost for deployment, etc. It could be widely applied to various domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, robot sensory, elderly and baby care in smart home, etc. Whether we can use the acoustic sensor data to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen relies heavily on the analytics capabilities we apply to the acoustic data, which has to overcome the obstacles of noise, disturbance and errors, and has to meet the requirement of real-time processing of high volume signals with large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on acoustic event recognition for machinery diagnosis, and show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8029228/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),25-30 June 2017,ieeexplore

Thus, for example, exact colour reproduction is required for remote medical diagnosis or remote operation. The doctor has to see the same image that appears in reality.

The estimations made by recently published data found that lung cancer deaths will increase from 1.6 million in 2012 to 3 million in 2035. This is mainly because most cases are still diagnosed in advanced stages, leading to considerably low survival rates. Therefore, urgent strategies are necessary to facilitate early diagnosis or improve current diagnosis techniques. Due to late detection, only approximately 15% of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary cancer are able to survive for a longer period of time, however, the survival rate increases considerably if the cancer is detected in its early stages. In this paper we aim to develop a software application able to accurately and non-invasively aid physicians for lung tumors differential diagnosis and biopsy guidance based on ultrasound image processing and neural networks.

In this paper, we manually study 22 open source software projects and summarize several observations on the comments of their configuration files, most of which lack sufficient information and are poorly formatted. Based on these observations and the general process of misconfiguration diagnosis, we design and implement a tool called ConfigFile++ that automatically enhances the comment in configuration files. By using name-based analysis and machine learning, ConfigFile++ extracts guiding information about the configuration option from the user manual and source code, and inserts it into the configuration files. The format of insert comment is also designed to make enhanced comments concise and clear. We use real-world examples of misconfigurations to evaluate our tool.

However, ECG recording is vulnerable to different types of noises and artifacts that make it very difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis. In this context, we propose a novel ECG denoising algorithm based on the deep Convolutional Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE) which requires minimal preprocessing steps, and conserves the important ECG features. In this study, the proposed CDAE algorithm is specifically implemented to remove the Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) from the recorded ECG signal. The CDAE was trained, validated and tested on a set of real ECG signals acquired from the well-known MIT-BIH-Arrythmia (MITDB) database with artificially generated AWGN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to some of the state-of-the-art methods.

10.1109/PHM-Paris.2019.00061,Convolutional Neural Network Based Rolling-Element Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Naturally Occurring and Progressing Defects Using Time-Frequency Domain Features,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are becoming increasingly popular for bearing fault diagnosis due to their ability to automatically capture the sensitive fault information without the need for expert knowledge. Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault and Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: (1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; (2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures. Finally, the potential challenges that come along with the implementation of Deep Learning technologies for industrial applications are discussed and future research directions are proposed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8756423/,2019 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Paris),2-5 May 2019,ieeexplore

Also the rapid development of deep learning segmentation and classification models alleviates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts of ultrasonic imaging. However, due to the privacy issues of medical data, it is not easy to acquire sufficient data for deep learning model training. In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used in data augmentation. However, GANs suffer from the problem of mode collapse in the training process then generate images with a limited variety. On the other hand, variational auto-encoder (VAE) is free from mode collapse but it generates blurred images. In this work, we study an auto-encoding generative adversarial network combining the advantages of GAN and VAE to generate realistic images for medical thyroid ultrasound image augmentation. Experiment results show that the generated images can simulate realistic ultrasound features and thyroid tissues for augmentation and help training a U-Net model to get better segmentation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9593403/,2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),11-16 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

When models learn spurious correlations not found in real-world situations, their deployment for critical tasks, such as medical decisions, can be catastrophic. In this work we address this issue for skin-lesion classification models, with two objectives: finding out what are the spurious correlations exploited by biased networks, and debiasing the models by removing such spurious correlations from them. We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias.

For machine health monitoring systems (MHMS), the major efforts have been put in designing and deploying more and more complex machine learning models which are also called as black-box models considering they are non-transparent towards their working mechanism. However, this research trend brings huge potential risk in real life. Since machine health monitoring itself is a high-stake decision scenario, the decision of the autonomous monitoring system should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: Why the deployed MHMS predict what they predict. In this paper, we shed some lights on this meaningful research direction: explainable machine health monitoring systems (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can only make diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named as DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), balances precision-explainability trade-off. Specifically, features and temporal information will be encoded in different stages of our model. Second, to explain the decision of the model, we adopt the gradient-based methods to generate features and temporal saliency maps highlighting which kind of features and time steps are key for the model's predictions.

Despite neural immaturity, seizures can also occur in preterm infants. However, surprisingly little is known about their evolution after an HI insult or patterns of expression. An improved understanding of preterm seizures will help facilitate diagnosis and prognosis and the implementation of treatments. This requires improved detection of seizures, including electrographic seizures. We have established a stable preterm fetal sheep model of HI that results in different types of post-HI seizures. These including the expression of epileptiform transients during the latent phase (0-6 h) of cerebral energy recovery, and bursts of high amplitude stereotypic evolving seizures (HAS) during the secondary phase of cerebral energy failure (~6-72 h). We have previously developed successful automated machine-learning strategies for accurate identification and quantification of the evolving micro-scale EEG patterns (e.g. gamma spikes and sharp waves), during the latent phase. The current paper introduces, for the first time, a real-time approach that employs a 15-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, directly fed with the raw EEG time-series, to identify HAS in the 1024Hz and 256Hz down-sampled data in our preterm fetuses post-HI. The classifier was trained and tested using EEG segments during ~6 to 48 hours post-HI recordings. The classifier accurately identified HAS with 98.52% accuracy in the 1024Hz and 97.78% in the 256Hz data.

This paper proposes a low power VLSI architecture that facilitates the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) into normal and other seven types of arrhythmia beats using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Unlike the existing methods for heartbeat classification, in which handcrafted ECG features are utilised, the proposed design leverages DNN for the classification of arrhythmia using a complete ECG beat. This obviates the need to extract ECG features separately and, produces an accurate and power optimised design for arrhythmia classification. Evaluation of the proposed methodology on the MIT-BIH dataset exhibits the accuracy and specificity of 97.01 % and 99.09%, respectively, which is comparable or better with respect to other algorithms implemented on software or ASIC based platforms. The proposed architecture is realised at 180nm CMOS technology having 0.624mm<sup>2</sup> area and exhibits 6.82× less power consumption at 1kHz as compared to others methods.

Majority of the faults which occur in induction motors are mainly diagnosed using motor current signature analysis. However, the accuracy of fault detection depends on selection of suitable features from motor current, the failure of which may result in incorrect interpretation. Considering the aforesaid fact, this paper presents an image processing aided deep learning framework for reliable diagnosis of induction motor faults, which eliminates the need of separate feature extraction stage. To this end, the motor current signals under different types of fault conditions were procured and were subsequently processed into frequency occurrence plots. The frequency occurrence image plots for different fault scenarios were finally used as inputs to a deep convolution neural network for the purpose of classification. Transfer learning technique was adopted to reduce the computation time of Convolution Neural Network and classification of motor faults was done at five different loading conditions. Four types of classification tasks have been addressed here and comprehensive analysis was done using a variety of CNN architectures.

Most matching systems do evaluation by comparing the correspondences with reference alignment. Since 2010 another method has been used to measure a logic-based of correspondence or mapping, called incoherent mapping measurement. The more incoherent of the mapping the lower quality of mapping. Incoherent mapping repair will restore the incoherent to coherent condition in mapping, by removing unwanted mapping. The process of removing unwanted mapping to restore the coherent condition is called diagnosis process. Since mappings are very important sources to support data integration and exchange, then diagnosis should be done as minimal as possible. We propose two focuses minimal using global new technique to repair the incoherent mapping. This approach should (1) ensure minimal impact on the input alignment by minimizing the number of mapping removed; and (2) minimize the average of confidence values of the mapping removed.

10.1109/ISORC49007.2020.00028,Failure Detection in TSN Startup Using Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Time triggered devices are increasingly deployed in safety-critical distributed applications. Failures that manifest during the startup process of the synchronisation service pose a challenge to diagnose. The difficulty stems from the fact that most implemented diagnostic services for time-triggered systems employ the prior knowledge of the schedule to provide diagnosis. However, at the beginning of the startup process, when the global time base is not yet established, these diagnostic services are not viable. This work proposes the use of a fault injection framework to generate data that resembles the behaviour of failed components during startup. The data generated can then be used for developing fault diagnostic mechanisms. Due to the large data set that can be provided by fault injection frameworks, deep learning is proposed as a strategy for failure identification. The data generated from a fault injection framework is used to train the neural network to distinguish between correct behaviour, corruption and omission failures during startup.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112868/,2020 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC),19-21 May 2020,ieeexplore

EEGs are typically used to diagnose and monitor disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain death and also to help the advancement of various fields of science such as cognitive science, and psychology. EEG signals usually suffer from a variety of artifacts caused by eye movements, chewing, muscle movements, and electrode pops, which disrupts the diagnosis and hinders precise representation of brain activities.

10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00085,Fast Outage Analysis of Large-Scale Production Clouds with Service Correlation Mining,IEEE,Conferences,"Cloud-based services are surging into popularity in recent years. However, outages, i.e., severe incidents that always impact multiple services, can dramatically affect user experience and incur severe economic losses. Locating the root-cause service, i.e., the service that contains the root cause of the outage, is a crucial step to mitigate the impact of the outage. In current industrial practice, this is generally performed in a bootstrap manner and largely depends on human efforts: the service that directly causes the outage is identified first, and the suspected root cause is traced back manually from service to service during diagnosis until the actual root cause is found. Unfortunately, production cloud systems typically contain a large number of interdependent services. Such a manual root cause analysis is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose COT, the first outage triage approach that considers the global view of service correlations. COT mines the correlations among services from outage diagnosis data. After learning from historical outages, COT can infer the root cause of emerging ones accurately. We implement COT and evaluate it on a real-world dataset containing one year of data collected from Microsoft Azure, one of the representative cloud computing platforms in the world. Our experimental results show that COT can reach a triage accuracy of 82.1%-83.5%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art triage approach by 28.0%-29.7%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9402074/,2021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),22-30 May 2021,ieeexplore

In this expert system, we use the object-oriented production rule to represent the knowledge, which solves the bottleneck problem of the diagnostic knowledge acquisition effectively. The inferential process begins with the abnormal event and finally finds all of the possible faults and the faulty component. For some possible faulty components, which have large number of fault samples, the neural network model can be used to diagnose. The training network of fault samples employs the BP neural network.

As a preliminary evaluation of FNB in real world scenario, the comparison is repeated on a real fuzzy dataset of 81 patients diagnosed with infectious diseases. The case study on simulated dataset elucidates that FNB can be optimal over NB for diagnosing patients with imprecise-fuzzy information, on account of the following characteristics - 1) it can model the information that, values of some attributes are semantically closer than values of other attributes, and 2) it offers a mechanism to temper exaggerations in patient information. Although the algorithm requires precise training data, its utility for fuzzy training data is argued for.

Various cases including High Impedance Faults (HIFs), normal condition, load switching and capacitor switching are subsequently investigated through the study of the model. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used as a feature extraction technique. The extracted features are subsequently fed into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) Schemes in order to effectively diagnose HIFs. ANN is used for fault classification and detection from other power system conditions. Furthermore, the GPR scheme is used to estimate the location of the fault. Thus a hybrid technique which comprises of DWT-ANN-GPR is proposed for HIF diagnosis.

Osteoporosis is a bone disease that commonly occurs among postmenopausal women and no effective treatments are available at the moment, except prevention, which requires early diagnosis. However, early detection of the disease is very difficult. This research aims to devise an intelligent diagnosis support system by using data mining ensemble technology to assist general practitioners assessing patient's risk at developing osteoporosis.

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based medical auxiliary diagnosis system, the impact of label noise problems is also increasing. When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, due to ambiguous patient conditions or poor reliability of diagnostic criteria, even clinical experts may lack confidence in making medical diagnoses for some patients. As a result, some samples used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, which adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we study a classification problem of sample labels with random damage. We propose a new hybrid label noise correction model that generalizes many learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. This hybrid model can withstand the negative effects of random noise and various non-random label noise. Extensive experimental results using real-world datasets from UCI machine learning repository are provided, the empirical study shows that our approach successfully improves data quality in many cases, in terms of classification accuracy, over existing label noise correction methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9442246/,2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),20-23 July 2020,ieeexplore

Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk.

Due to its direct impact on Central Nervous System if tumor cells prevail at certain locations in the brain, the overall functionality of the body is disturbed and chances of a person approaching death accelerate. Tumors can be cancerous or non-cancerous but in many cases, the chances of complete recovery are less and as a result death rate has increased all over the world despite recent advancements in technology, equipment and awareness. So the main concern is to detect brain related diseases at early stages so that it does not spread into vital parts of brain and disrupt body functions. Also, more precise and accurate technologies are required to serve as aid in diagnosis, treatment and surgery of brain. Therefore, its high alarming time to monitor mortality statistics and develop faster and accurate methods to curb the situation by simulating tissue deformation and locating cancerous nodes which is a good area of research. A brain tumor is used to design the deformation model. Early stage detection of tumors is difficult from images. Moreover, the accuracy involved is less. Keeping all this into consideration, a machine learning approach has been developed to detect and model tissue deformation with classification of soft and hard tissues so that the tissues having risk of future problem can also be recognized. The machine learning is the approach which learns from the existing patterns and derives new patterns based on their input parameters. This approach can be used in real time for modeling of tissue deformation in image guided neurosurgery.

The deluge of IoT data creates enormous opportunities for us to explore the physical world, especially with the help of deep learning techniques. Traditionally, the Cloud is the option for deploying deep learning based applications. However, the challenges of Cloud-centric IoT systems are increasing due to significant data movement overhead, escalating energy needs, and privacy issues. Rather than constantly moving a tremendous amount of raw data to the Cloud, it would be beneficial to leverage the emerging powerful IoT devices to perform the inference task. Nevertheless, the statically trained model could not efficiently handle the dynamic data in the real in-situ environments, which leads to low accuracy. Moreover, the big raw IoT data challenges the traditional supervised training method in the Cloud. To tackle the above challenges, we propose In-situ AI, the first Autonomous and Incremental computing framework and architecture for deep learning based IoT applications. We equip deep learning based IoT system with autonomous IoT data diagnosis (minimize data movement), and incremental and unsupervised training method (tackle the big raw IoT data generated in ever-changing in-situ environments). To provide efficient architectural support for this new computing paradigm, we first characterize the two In-situ AI tasks (i.e. inference and diagnosis tasks) on two popular IoT devices (i.e. mobile GPU and FPGA) and explore the design space and tradeoffs. Based on the characterization results, we propose two working modes for the In-situ AI tasks, including Single-running and Co-running modes. Moreover, we craft analytical models for these two modes to guide the best configuration selection. We also develop a novel two-level weight shared In-situ AI architecture to efficiently deploy In-situ tasks to IoT node. Compared with traditional IoT systems, our In-situ AI can reduce data movement by 28-71%, which further yields 1.4X-3.3X speedup on model update and contributes to 30-70% energy saving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8327001/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA),24-28 Feb. 2018,ieeexplore

An approach toward a real environment implementation,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper considers the problem of characterize the way people drive applied to driver assistance systems without using direct driver signals. To make this, was developed an intelligent driving diagnosis system based on neural networks [2]. This take into account signals that can be acquired by a GPS data logging system: position, velocity, accelerations and steering angle. Now, are presented two approaches based on this intelligent driving diagnosis system. The first, propose to identify potential high risk areas on the road taking into account the average rate of diagnosis in each signal on the road. The second, present the structure of a driver model based on neural networks and using as inputs statistical transformations of the driving diagnosis time signals: inadequate steering and pedals inputs, speeding and road or lane departure. The validation of this model is developed in two applications: driver identification and driver classification (good or bad). In addition, an architecture based on fuzzy logic for real environment implementation is presented. System performance was tested in a driving simulation system [13]. Results presented in this paper shows that our intelligent driving diagnosis system allows to identify potential high risk locations on roads, and also is able to classify different kinds of drivers with a high degree of reliability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6294312/,2012 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES 2012),24-27 July 2012,ieeexplore

10.1109/SYSTOL.2010.5675940,Intelligent monitoring and fault tolerance in large-scale distributed systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only. Electronic devices are starting to become widely available for monitoring and controlling large-scale distributed systems. These devices may include sensing capabilities for online measurement, actuators for controlling certain variables, microprocessors for processing information and making realtime decisions based on designed algorithms, and telecommunication units for exchanging information with other electronic devices or possibly with human operators. A collection of such devices may be referred to as a networked intelligent agent system. Such systems have the capability to generate a huge volume of spatial-temporal data that can be used for monitoring and control applications of large-scale distributed systems. One of the most important research challenges in the years ahead is the development of information processing methodologies that can be used to extract meaning and knowledge out of the ever-increasing electronic information that will become available. Even more important is the capability to utilize the information that is being produced to design software and devices that operate seamlessly, autonomously and reliably in some intelligent manner. The ultimate objective is to design networked intelligent agent systems that can make appropriate real-time decisions in the management of large-scale distributed systems, while also providing useful high-level information to human operators. One of the most important classes of large-scale distributed systems deals with the reliable operation and intelligent management of critical infrastructures, such as electric power systems, telecommunication networks, water systems, and transportation systems. The design, control and fault monitoring of critical infrastructure systems is becoming increasingly more challenging as their size, complexity and interactions are steadily growing. Moreover, these critical infrastructures are susceptible to natural disasters, frequent failures, as well as malicious attacks. There is a need to develop a common system-theoretic fault diagnostic framework for critical infrastructure systems and to design architectures and algorithms for intelligent monitoring, control and security of such systems. The goal of this presentation is to motivate the need for health monitoring, fault diagnosis and security of critical infrastructure systems and to provide a fault diagnosis methodology for detecting, isolating and accommodating both abrupt and incipient faults in a class of complex nonlinear dynamic systems. A detection and approximation estimator based on computational intelligence techniques is used for online health monitoring. Various adaptive approximation techniques and learning algorithms will be presented and illustrated, and directions for future research will be discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5675940/,2010 Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol),6-8 Oct. 2010,ieeexplore

The use of mobile-based solution will significantly contribute on the availability and accessibility of human expert's knowledge on this domain. In this study, a convolutional neural network was used and deployed on an android-based mobile application to perform detection and diagnosis of jackfruit fruit damages caused by pests (fruit borer and fruit fly) and diseases (rhizopus fruit rot and sclerotium fruit rot).

Based on a large amount of historical data, a joint self-learning and fuzzy clustering algorithm was developed. The joint algorithm combines the advantages of the fuzzy clustering algorithm and of the self-learning algorithm; the fuzzy clustering algorithm has been widely applied in fault diagnosis of conventional mechanical systems, but is difficult to be applied for the fault diagnosis of railway vehicle running gears in the specific track-vehicle environment, due to the track irregularities. When combined with the self-learning algorithm, the new joint algorithm converts original featured values into clustering series as new judgement criteria by clustering samples in the same section, and then obtains the dynamic early warning threshold to realize the vibration monitoring and early warning of the railway vehicle running gear. A mechanical vibration test rig was built to verify the new joint algorithm.

Previous studies mainly focus on QoS (Quality of Service) based anomaly detection and root cause analysis, but the cellular network operators pay more attention to the userâ€™s QoE (Quality of Experience) degradation since QoE can better represent the userâ€™s actual service experience. To achieve online QoE anomaly detection and root cause analysis, in this paper, we present a new integrated anomaly detection and diagnosis framework. Firstly, QoE is expressed by the KQIs (Key Quality Indicators) vector of the userâ€™s three most common services with largest traffic. And then, QoE anomaly detection is processed by using two-step clustering method (SOM+K-mediods) to obtain QoE Anomaly Codebooks. Diagnosis is achieved by selecting KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and learning their characteristic impact on KQIs to obtain Fault Cause Codebooks. The QoE Anomaly Codebooks are used to detect anomaly samples, and the Fault Cause Codebooks are applied to find the fault cause types. The designed framework has been evaluated with real 4G data. For comparison, three other two- step clustering algorithms are introduced, and results show that our framework can achieve the highest detection accuracy rate.

High quality diagnosis results, measured in terms of accuracy and resolution, are crucial for physical failure analysis during fast yield ramping. Despite various existing methods for enhancing diagnosis, there is still ample room for further improvement. In this paper, a new machine learning based diagnosis method is proposed for improving both accuracy and resolution. Based on features extracted from tester and simulation data, the goal is to predict whether a defect candidate actually corresponds to the real defect. Specifically, semi-supervised learning is deployed to use unlabeled data to augment model training. In addition, a defect-level learning procedure uses characteristics from similar defects to further improve resolution. Experiments involving virtual and silicon datasets demonstrate significant improvements that include: 6.4× increase in occurrences of perfect diagnosis, and a performance that consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art diagnosis techniques.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325212/,2020 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC),1-6 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587406,Large margin pursuit for a Conic Section classifier,IEEE,Conferences,"Learning a discriminant becomes substantially more difficult when the datasets are high-dimensional and the available samples are few. This is often the case in computer vision and medical diagnosis applications. A novel conic section classifier (CSC) was recently introduced in the literature to handle such datasets, wherein each class was represented by a conic section parameterized by its focus, directrix and eccentricity. The discriminant boundary was the locus of all points that are equi-eccentric relative to each class-representative conic section. Simpler boundaries were preferred for the sake of generalizability. In this paper, we improve the performance of the two-class classifier via a large margin pursuit. When formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, the margin computation is demonstrated to be hard, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data. Instead, we present a geometric algorithm to compute the distance of a point to the non-linear discriminant boundary generated by the CSC in the input space. We then introduce a large margin pursuit in the learning phase so as to enhance the generalization capacity of the classifier. We validate the algorithm on real datasets and show favorable classification rates in comparison to many existing state-of-the-art binary classifiers as well as the CSC without margin pursuit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4587406/,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,23-28 June 2008,ieeexplore

This paper proposes a simplified DT model, which can be realized in APP based on iOS system. The APP classifies real-time ECG data into different arrhythmias, and the delay latency is 500 ms in average. Meanwhile, according to 4G or Wi-Fi, the collected ECG data are uploaded to the cloud server for training DT. Then, the coefficients of the pre-trained DT will be sent back to the APP for updating.

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure.

Datasets from the ISIC Archive were implemented during training, validation and testing. Further tests were performed on a smaller dataset of images taken from the Dermnet NZ website and from recent clinical cases still awaiting histological results to indicate the trained network's ability to generalise to real cases. The 86% test accuracy achieved with the proposed method was comparable to the results of prior studies but required significantly less pre-processing actions to classify a lesion and was not dependant on consistent image scaling or the presence of a scale on the image.

The running status of radars are consecutively recorded in time series to monitor the status of different channels. However, due to the large sum of data, the status data is not rigorously used to diagnose possible radar faults. Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data. Based on the assumption that anomaly deviates from normal data, the time periods with large prediction error can be recognized as faults.

We aim to develop an advanced diagnostic system in a manner that meets the requirements of real-time and extensibility of medical services for skin disease detection. The proposed system provides offline diagnosis for the users who have not Internet connection or online diagnosing uses on-cloud service. The user captures the affected area and get the offline immediate report. The schema offers the users a communication window with dermatologists to get medical recommendations in addition to an online accurate diagnosis service. The new images that are labeled by dermatologists are used to retrain the model to enhance model accuracy. To maximize the number of users, the system is implemented in a mobile-based environment. With the growing numbers of portable apps, it becomes easy for people to obtain up-to-date data. Users are familiar with looking for answers from the virtual globe including health issues. The following experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

10.1109/ACITT.2019.8780078,Modern Hardware and Software Solution for Identification of Abnormal Neurological Movements of Patients with Essential Tremor,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the real physical movements, associated with tremor, which is very small rapid fluctuations that vary greatly in amplitude and frequency, reliable measurements of motion characteristics and the interpretation of the results of such measurements are important for the diagnosis of diseases. Increasing of amplitude and changing the frequency and form of oscillation in relation to the norm (frequency and amplitude of physiological tremor) are signs of disturbance of central and peripheral neural mechanisms of regulation of movements. Program analysis of these parameters is important for understanding the role of dysfunction of individual structures of the brain in the processes of motion management, and for the clinic in the aspects of early detection, more accurate diagnosis of motor disorders, the choice and correction of optimal treatment methods associated with the selection of effective therapy. The analysis of tremor forms has great importance in neurological practice, in particular, in the diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome. Computerized analysis methods are extremely accurate and effective in assessing the degree of tremor of patients. Mathematical modeling allows obtaining frequency characteristics, amplitude of oscillation, deviation from normal state, etc. Development of mathematical models and methods, means of identification greatly facilitate the work with patients; make it possible to assess the degree of disease with a single and objective side.

10.1109/ICAC.2005.42,Multi-resolution Abnormal Trace Detection Using Varied-length N-grams and Automata,IEEE,Conferences,Detection and diagnosis of faults in a large-scale distributed system is a formidable task. Interest in monitoring and using traces of user requests for fault detection has been on the rise recently. In this paper we propose novel fault detection methods based on abnormal trace detection. One essential problem is how to represent the large amount of training trace data compactly as an oracle. Our key contribution is the novel use of varied-length n-grams and automata to characterize normal traces. A new trace is compared against the learned automata to determine whether it is abnormal. We develop algorithms to automatically extract n-grams and construct multiresolution automata from training data. Further both deterministic and multihypothesis algorithms are proposed for detection. We inspect the trace constraints of real application software and verify the existence of long n-grams.

10.1109/APSEC.2018.00033,NotOnlyLog: Mining Patch-Log Associations from Software Evolution History to Enhance Failure Diagnosis Capability,IEEE,Conferences,"Log messages are widely used in the diagnosis of software failures. Existing studies of failure diagnosis based on log messages tend to use rule-based methods or execution-path-based methods. Rule-based methods generate bug-fixing rules using either human expertise, which is time consuming, or machine learning methods, which may lack the precision of failure diagnosis. To remedy these problems, researchers propose execution-path-based methods that reconstruct execution paths by analyzing source code and run-time logs. These methods, however, may lead to path explosion. To fill this gap, our work focuses on solving the path explosion problem in execution-path-based methods. We assume that run-time logs may have a relationship with their corresponding patches in real-world bug reports. We conduct empirical studies on seven open-source software packages and obtain two findings: (1) 80% of similar bugs have similar patches, and (2) 70% of faulty code is found to lie near the code where the first failure message is printed. Based on these two observations, we design and implement a practical tool NotOnlyLog for bug diagnosis. NotOnlyLog is able to mine the relationships between failure logs and their corresponding patches, in order to reduce both the number and length of uncertain execution paths in bug diagnosis. We evaluate the performance of NotOnlyLog on nine real-world bugs from three large open-source projects.

The voltage ratios together with the calculated energies are considered as the important features for the ANN training for short-switch faults. The whole scheme is implemented by simulation in Matlab/ Simulink. The simulation results show that the scheme successfully identifies the short switch fault for any switch health conditions. Moreover, the scheme is simple and does not involve too many computations. This ensures the real time applicability of the proposed algorithm in any fast acting digital signal processor. The scheme is universal and can be applied to any other inverter topology as well.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7513290/,Michael Faraday IET International Summit 2015,12-13 Sept. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICNF.2017.7985948,Portable measurement system for breath analysis by real-time fluctuation enhanced sensing method,IEEE,Conferences,"Resistance flicker noise of gas sensors gives a new opportunity to improve gas detection by enhancing selectivity and sensitivity of cheap and popular gas sensors. The improvement at low gas concentrations can be even increased further by UV light irradiating the gas sensing layers exhibiting photocatalytic effect (e.g., WO<sub>3</sub> or TiO<sub>2</sub> gas sensing layers). A new system has been developed recently to utilize low frequency noise measurement method but controlling a set of sensors applied for breath analysis and medical check-up. The system measures DC resistance and resistance noise in an array of four prototype resistive gas sensors. An operating temperature of each sensor can be set independently by the software controlling the system. Some sensors can be irradiated by the UV light as well. Humidity, temperature and pressure within a miniature gas chamber, of a volume about 40 ml, is monitored to secure repeatable conditions during the measurements and to avoid humidity condensation in the exhaled breath. The setup is controlled by an FPGA circuit performing necessary computations (power spectrum density estimation) and data transmission. Further processing by applying selected detection or gas concentration estimation methods can be done by a smartphone or a PC controlling the measurement setup.

It has also become a necessity to predict the faults that could occur between the different transfer nodes of the enterprise application. The features of preventive maintenance which includes methodical study, estimation, the notion of time, the diagnosis of faults and so on can be analyzed using well designed and structured methods of relevance to the application domain. In this scenario, the technologies which are focused are diagnosis of faults and activities, prediction of the states and monitoring the conditions.

10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196,Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Belief Networks for Prognosis of Breast Cancer,IEEE,Conferences,"We propose a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) for prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer. PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes. Extensive experiments using real-world databases, such as METABRIC and NKI, show promising results in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers, for classifying tumors and predicting events like recurrence and metastasis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7424407/,2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA),9-11 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore

Timely recognition of early symptoms of a disease can help avoid the spread of epidemics on the plantations. In this regard, most of the existing solutions use some AI techniques on smart edge devices (IoTs or intelligent Cyber Physical Systems), typically equipped with a hardware like sensors and actuators. However, the resource constraints on such devices like energy (power), memory and computation capability, make the execution of complex operations and AI algorithms (neural network models) for disease detection quite challenging. To this end, compression and quantization techniques offer viable solutions to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks while maximizing performance on the constrained devices. In this paper, we realized a real intelligent CPS on top of which we implemented an AI application, called Deep Leaf running on a microcontroller of the STM32 family, to detect coffee plant diseases with the help of a Quantized Convolutional Neural Network (Q-CNN) model. We present a quantitative analysis of Deep Leaf by comparing five different deep learning models: a 32-bit floating point model, a compressed model, and three different types of quantized models exhibiting differences in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, average inference time, and energy consumption.

We present the development and functioning of our lab-developed fNIRS system. It provides a real-time display of variation in blood chromophores related to neuronal activation. It employs 128 dual-wavelength LEDs of 735 nm and 850 nm. The selection of these wavelengths allows computation of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). A single photosensor is used in the presented device.

People with LBP show altered trunk muscle activity and enhanced fatigability of trunk muscles is associated with the development and future risk of LBP. Therefore, a system that can forecast trunk muscle activity and detect fatigue can help subjects, practitioners and physiotherapists in the diagnosis, monitoring and recovery of LBP. In this paper, we present a novel approach in order to determine whether subjects are fatigued, or transitioning to fatigue, 25 seconds ahead of time using surface Electromyography (sEMG) from 14 trunk muscles. This is achieved using a three-step approach: A) extracting features related to fatigue from sEMG, B) forecasting the features using a real-time adaptive filter and C) performing dimensionality reduction (from 70 to 2 features) and then classifying subjects using a supervised machine learning algorithm.

The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into a knowledge-based expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line past-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the case of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, hypothesis resting on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts.

In order to overcome those problems, firstly, the general mathematical description of the Binary Classification Problem with Error Cost and Class-dependent Reject Cost (BCP-EC<sup>2</sup>RC) is proposed. Secondly, as one of implementation methods of BCP-EC<sup>2</sup>RC, the new algorithm, named as Cost-sensitive Support Vector Machines with the Error Cost and the Class-dependent Reject Cost (CSVM-EC<sup>2</sup>RC), is presented. The CSVM-EC<sup>2</sup>RC algorithm involves two stages: estimating the classification reliability based on trained SVM classifier, and determining the optimal reject rate of positive class and negative class by minimizing the average cost based on the given error cost and class-dependent reject cost. The experiment studies based on a benchmark data set illustrate that the proposed algorithm is effective.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5460735/,2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing,9-11 Feb. 2010,ieeexplore
10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172454,Semi-Supervised Machine Learning for Spacecraft Anomaly Detection &amp; Diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper describes Anomaly Detection via Topological-feature Map (ADTM), a data-driven approach to Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) for monitoring the health of spacecraft and space habitats. Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults. We include an analysis and discussion of ADTM's performance on several of these fault cases. We conclude with a brief discussion of future work, which contains investigation of a hierarchical SOM-architecture as well as a Case-Based Reasoning module for further assisting astronauts in diagnosis and remediation activities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172454/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/DASC.2012.6382418,Semi-supervised learning of decision making for parts faults to system-level failures diagnosis in avionics system,IEEE,Conferences,"Supervised fault detection and fault diagnosis are the techniques for recognizing small faults with abrupt or incipient time behavior in closed loops. Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system. The presented structure is generic and can be extended to the verification and validation of other diagnosis and prognostic algorithms on different platforms. It has been successfully preventing aircraft system/subsystem failures, identifying and predicting failures that will occur, which provides real application on making health management information and decisions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6382418/,2012 IEEE/AIAA 31st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),14-18 Oct. 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/INDIANCC.2016.7441102,Sensor health monitoring using simple data driven approaches,IEEE,Conferences,"Present day high end vehicles contain as many as 100 microprocessors and have more than 100 million lines of code [3]. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7441102/,2016 Indian Control Conference (ICC),4-6 Jan. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICCEA53728.2021.00060,ShuffleNet2MC: A method of light weight fault diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"Bearing fault diagnosis plays an important role in the field of modern industry. Although convolution neural network achieves good results, large amount of parameters costs a lot of calculation, which brings challenges to the deployment of fault diagnosis tasks in low computational power equipments. To solve the problems, an novel CNN model ShuffleNet2MC based on improved Shufflenetv2 network is proposed. Firstly, Depthwise convolution and Channel Shuffle are used to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the accuracy of diagnosis computation; Secondly, mixed convolution is used to extract the features of different resolutions through multi-scale and multi-channel method, which improves the accuracy of the model; Finally, K-means quantization is applied to the model, which greatly reduces the GFLOPS of the model and further improves the performance of the model while ensuring that the accuracy is basically unchanged. A large number of experiments on the bearing fault dataset of Western Reserve University show that: The times of floating point operation and classification accuracy of ShufflenetV2 are 0.001GFLOPS and 97.9% respectively in the task of fault diagnosis.

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis (unhealthy individuals). We evaluated the proposed approach using available physiological sensor data from Physionet databases, and achieved 38% energy reduction in comparison to the conventional deep learning approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8036767/,2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),11-15 July 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580709,Statistical spectral feature extraction for classification of epileptic EEG signals,IEEE,Conferences,Discrimination of epileptic activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals continuously recorded from the brain may facilitate the effective and accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. This paper proposes a new statistical method combined with a simple classification algorithm that can discriminate epileptic EEG signals from normal signals. The statistical method extracts most significant spectral features by maximizing statistical distance between the epileptic and the normal power spectrums. The power spectrum density of EEG signals is estimated by the multi-taper method. A linear algorithm based on the Fisher discriminant analysis classifies the selected spectral features as either the epileptic or the normal class from the EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that our method could reach &gt;99.6% classification accuracy while its computational complexity appears to be much lower than the previously proposed methods that exhibited similar classification performances. It is suggested that our method may be readily implemented in real time with high accuracy so that it can provide an on-line monitoring tool for clinical epilepsy diagnosis.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5580709/,2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics,11-14 July 2010,ieeexplore

Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system.

In fact, most of the computation in ANN is multiplication and addition. While digital signal processors (DSP) has altitude advantage on multiplication and addition computation, it can perform parallel multiplication and addition in a single cycle clock.

Not limited in disease, the sub-health is bedeviling humanity more generally. An increasing number of people go in quest of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for life quality, since TCM achieves the significant and curative effectiveness in recuperating certain sub-health conditions. However, the lack of clinical data poses a vast challenge on the emerging deep-learning-based methods in modeling TCM diagnosis. In this paper, a Similar Sparse Domain Adaptation (SSDA) method is proposed in modeling the tongue inspection, which is one of the four diagnostic methods and plays important roles in TCM primary diagnosis. First, a similar domain adaptation is introduced to transfer necessary knowledge efficiently and overcome insufficient data. Then, inspired by the Lottery Ticket hypothesis, the network is pruned to generate sparse subnet using in adaptation. Finally, the model with two combined sparse network is designed.

Distributed Databases represents a software system that allows a multitude of applications to access the data stored in local or remote databases. In this scenario, the data distribution is achieved through the process of replication. Nowadays many solutions for storing the data are available: relational distributed Database Management Systems (DBMS), NoSQL storing solutions, NewSQL storing solutions, graph oriented databases, object oriented databases, object-relational databases, etc. The present study analyzes the most commonly used storing solution: the relational model. The replication topology used in the related experiments was the classical publisher-subscriber topology. The distribution of data is made from the publisher system. The present work studies the interaction between the most suited distributed data mining architecture (Distributed Committee Machines) for mining distributed data and real relational distributed databases. The chosen Data Mining task is the classification one. Distributed Committee Machines are a group of neuronal networks working in a distributed procedure to obtain an improved classification performance compared to a single neural structure. In these experiments we used the classical multilayer perceptron trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The execution performance of the Distributed Committee Machine is analyzed, based on some of the most used types of replication in relational databases: snapshot replication, merge replication, transactional replication, and transactional with queued updating replication. For all these types of replications the execution performances (distributed speedup and distributed efficiency) of the entire system is also analyzed.

Although there have been studies on diversity and its links to overall ensemble accuracy, little work has been done on the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures in class imbalance learning. The study of class imbalance learning is important, because many real-world problems, such as those in medical diagnosis, fraud detection, condition monitoring, etc., have imbalanced classes, where a minority class is usually more important and interesting than the majority class. In order to gain a deeper understanding of ensemble learning for imbalanced classes, this paper studies the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures theoretically and empirically.

10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506482,Towards Deep Learning-Based Sarcopenia Screening with Body Joint Composition Analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Sarcopenia, a newly recognized geriatric syndrome, now prevalent in the rapidly aging region of Asia, is characterized by the age-related decline of skeletal muscle mass plus relatively low muscle strength and/or physical performance. Doctors screen for sarcopenia by observing patients’ habitual gait features without quantification and the performance of gait disturbances differ in various people that are considered to be sarcopenic, which is an important basis along with reduced physical functioning for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Such a subjective diagnosis has been seen as a problem because diagnostic results may differ among doctors and factors such as fatigue may affect diagnosis. To strengthen and aid the use of these observations, we built a novel automatic deep learning model based on random forest for real-time human body joint detection coupled with a modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to recognize gait features for further clinical analysis. Aligned with the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) [1] aims, our goal is to facilitate the implementation of standardized sarcopenia diagnosis in clinical practice by providing an automatic gait analysis system. Our model is recorded from geriatric patients for whole gait understanding.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092364,Towards real-time implementation of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) — How to Identify optimum acoustic output for SHAPE?,IEEE,Conferences,"Pressure measurements within the chambers of the heart yield critical information for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients (~92 million Americans), but the procedure used to gain these pressures, cardiac catheterization, is invasive and expensive. Subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) may be able to estimate intra-cardiac pressures noninvasively, if the optimum incident acoustic output (IAO) for SHAPE can be established in real-time. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine in real-time the optimum IAO for SHAPE. We developed a customized interface on a SonixTablet scanner (BK Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) using C/C++ and Qt libraries (The Qt Company, Oslo, Norway). In vitro experiments were conducted using a closed-loop flow system. Activated Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, N. Billerica, MA, USA; 0.1 ml) was mixed with 750 ml isotonic diluent. A pressure catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was used to acquire ambient pressure values. A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (f<sub>transmit</sub>: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). At the optimum IAO level the correlation coefficient between SHAPE and the pressure catheter data ranged between -0.6 and -0.9; for the IAO immediately below and above the optimum IAO, ranges were -0.4 to -0.8, and -0.6 to -0.8, respectively. In conclusion, optimum IAO level determination for insonating microbubbles to be utilized for SHAPE has been demonstrated; this will assist in real-time clinical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8092364/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets.

Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries. ADDO currently includes 7060 concepts, 99 properties, 46274 axioms, and 30708 annotations. As a result, ADDO is consistent and more reliable in managing most AD aspects than other existing AD ontologies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311736/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2832648,A Cost-Sensitive Deep Belief Network for Imbalanced Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Imbalanced data with a skewed class distribution are common in many real-world applications. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning technique that is effective in classification tasks. However, conventional DBN does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes equal costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches assign different misclassification costs for different classes without disrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive learning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential evolution to optimize the misclassification costs based on the training data that presents an effective approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e., G-mean) into the objective function. We first optimize the misclassification costs, and then apply them to DBN. Adaptive differential evolution optimization is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates its corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge. The experiments have shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on both benchmark data sets and real-world data set for fault diagnosis in tool condition monitoring.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8368071/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Jan. 2019,ieeexplore

The digital revolution has transformed the manufacturing industry into smart manufacturing through the development of intelligent systems. In this paper, a big data ecosystem is presented for the implementation of fault detection and diagnosis in predictive maintenance with real industrial big data gathered directly from large-scale global manufacturing plants, aiming to provide a complete architecture which could be used in industrial IoT-based smart manufacturing in an industrial 4.0 system. The proposed architecture overcomes multiple challenges including big data ingestion, integration, transformation, storage, analytics, and visualization in a real-time environment using various technologies such as the data lake, NoSQL database, Apache Spark, Apache Drill, Apache Hive, OPC Collector, and other techniques. Transformation protocols, authentication, and data encryption methods are also utilized to address data and network security issues. A MapReduce-based distributed PCA model is designed for fault detection and diagnosis. In a large-scale manufacturing system, not all kinds of failure data are accessible, and the absence of labels precludes all the supervised methods in the predictive phase. Furthermore, the proposed framework takes advantage of some of the characteristics of PCA such as its ease of implementation on Spark, its simple algorithmic structure, and its real-time processing ability. All these elements are essential for smart manufacturing in the evolution to Industry 4.0. The proposed detection system has been implemented into the real-time industrial production system in a cooperated company, running for several years, and the results successfully provide an alarm warning several days before the fault happens.

10.1109/TIM.2021.3088489,A Hybrid Generalization Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Under Unseen Working Conditions,IEEE,Journals,"The data-driven methods in machinery fault diagnosis have become increasingly popular in the past two decades. However, the wide applications of this scheme are generally compromised in real-world conditions because of the discrepancy between the training data and testing data. Although the recently emerging transfer fault diagnosis can learn transferable features from relevant source data and adapt the diagnostic model to the target data, these methods still only work on the target domain with a priori data distribution. The generalization capability of the transferred model cannot be guaranteed for unseen domains. Since the working conditions of machinery are varying during operation, the generalization capability of the diagnosis methods is crucial in this case. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a domain generalization-based hybrid diagnosis network for deploying to unseen working conditions. The main idea is to regularize the discriminant structure of the deep network with both intrinsic and extrinsic generalization objectives such that the diagnostic model can learn robust features and generalize to unseen domains. The triplet loss minimization of intrinsic multisource data is implemented to facilitate the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability at the class level, leading to a more generalized decision boundary. The extrinsic domain-level regularization is achieved by using adversarial training to further reduce the risk of overfitting.

Different intelligent application scenarios can benefit from these computer-based systems that predict the ages of people correctly. Automatic apparent age system is particularly useful in medical diagnosis, facial beauty product development, movie role casting, the effect of plastic surgery, and anti-aging treatment. Predicting the real and apparent age of people has been quite difficult for both machines and humans. More recently, Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods have been extensively used for these classification task. It has incomparable advantages in extracting discriminative image features from human faces. However, many of the existing CNN-based methods are designed to be deeper and larger with more complex layers that makes it challenging to deploy on mobile devices with resource-constrained features. Therefore, we design a lightweight CNN model of fewer layers to estimate the real and apparent age of individuals from unconstrained real-time face images that can be deployed on mobile devices. The experimental results, when analyzed for classification accuracy on FG-NET, MORPH-II and APPA-REAL, with large-scale face images containing both real and apparent age annotations, show that our model obtains a state-of-the-art performance in both real and apparent age classification when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The core focus of this algorithm is to explore the effectiveness of MV information embedding in learning models and viable implementation in real-time applications. Our method is capable of incorporating high-dimensional information inherent in MV features generated from available inputs using the proposed DCA-based scheme. The algorithm is tested with two real-time electromyogram data sets, which include three categories of nonlinear data-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myopathy, and healthy control subjects. A set of MV features is generated in both the time and the wavelet domain for all of the study groups.

The discriminant features are applied for the statistical analysis and the model validation. The model achieves an accuracy of 99.03% with a specificity of 99.58% and sensitivities of 98.50% and 97.59%.

As one of the emerging technologies in the next-generation cellular systems, small cells, or so-called “femtocells” in indoor environments, are expected to be densely deployed for the ubiquitous coverage and capacity enhancement in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. However, unplanned femtocell deployment and complex interior layouts of buildings may lead to severe coverage and capacity problems and even possible negative impacts on the dense deployment. In this paper, we aim at developing a data-driven indoor diagnostic framework for fault detection in cellular-assisted IoT networks. The framework utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze crowd-sourced measurements uploaded from diverse end devices. Then, some well-trained prediction models are used to construct a global view of a radio environment, namely, radio environment map (REM), for diagnosis and management purposes. Moreover, REMs enable operators to detect existing coverage and capacity problems at any interested location. To verify the feasibility of indoor diagnoses, we collect a real trace data from an indoor testbed and then conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the machine-learning algorithms in terms of the accuracy, the time complexity, and the sensitivity to data volumes.

In this context, it is of paramount importance to identify such conflicts before sending network service (NS) request (NS-Req) to the embedding algorithm to avoid unexpected behavior in its execution. Since both NS-Req and NFV infrastructure (NFVI) may contain many policies, the process of conflict detection and diagnosis is an intricate work both for humans and computer systems. Besides, as conflicts may occur among a set of constraints, pairwise detection will not suffice. Therefore, this paper proposes NSChecker, a semantic verification system to detect and diagnose policy conflicts in NFV environments. To achieve its functionality, NSChecker uses an ontology, called Onto-NFV, to describe the NFVI, NS, and associated policies. With Onto-NFV, conflicts detection is carried out through description logic (DL) inconsistency verification. We develop a prototype of NSChecker in Java and validate its capabilities on a small scenario with three use cases, showing that it supports conflict detection concerning the following policies: network function precedence, resource usage, and location. Finally, we evaluate NSChecker performance using some real topologies.

It holds an important place in theory and practice, because a huge number of real-world problems, such as timetabling, planning, routing, bioinformatics, fault diagnosis, etc., could be encoded into it. Stochastic local search (SLS) methods can solve many real-world problems that often involve large-scale instances at reasonable computation costs while delivering good-quality solutions. In this work, we propose a novel SLS algorithm called adaptive variable depth SLS for PMSAT problem solving based on a dynamic local search framework. Our algorithm exploits two algorithmic components of an SLS method: parameter tuning and neighborhood search. Our first contribution is the design of an adaptive parameter tuner that searches for the best parameter setting for each instance by considering its features.

In contrast to monolithic diagnosis systems, the neural-network-based approach presented here accomplishes the scalability and dynamic adaptability requirements of the application. Mapping the power grid onto a set of interconnected modules that model the functional behavior of electrical equipment provides the flexibility and speed demanded by the problem. After a preliminary generation of candidate fault locations, competition among hypotheses results in a fully justified diagnosis that may include simultaneous faults. The way in which the neural system is conceived allows for a natural parallel implementation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/485636/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,March 1996,ieeexplore

This system has been developed in the frame of the Mobile Tele-Echography Using an Ultralight Robot European Project. A light-weight six degrees-of-freedom serial robot, with a remote center of motion, has been specially designed for this application. It holds and moves a real probe on a distant patient according to the expert gesture and permits an image acquisition using a standard ultrasound device. The combination of mechanical structure choice for the robot and dedicated control law, particularly nearby the singular configuration allows a good path following and a robotized gesture accuracy. The choice of compression techniques for image transmission enables a compromise between flow and quality. These combined approaches, for robotics and image processing, enable the medical specialist to better control the remote ultrasound probe holder system and to receive stable and good quality ultrasound images to make a diagnosis via any type of communication link from terrestrial to satellite.

However, the volume and fast changing behavior of metric streams have rendered it a challenging task. Many diagnosis frameworks often rely on thresholding with stationarity or normality assumption, or on complex models requiring extensive offline training. Such techniques are known to be prone to spurious false-alarms in online settings as metric streams undergo rapid contextual changes from known baselines. Hence, we propose two unsupervised incremental techniques following a two-step strategy. First, we estimate an underlying temporal property of the stream via adaptive learning and, then we apply statistically robust control charts to recognize deviations. We evaluated our techniques by replaying over 40 time-series streams from the Yahoo! Webscope S5 datasets as well as four other traces of real Web service QoS and ISP traffic measurements. Our methods achieve high detection accuracy and few false-alarms, and better performance in general compared to an open-source package for time-series anomaly detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8031053/,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,March 2018,ieeexplore

However their on-site application is a rather difficult task as PD information is generally superimposed with electromagnetic disturbances. These disturbances affect negatively all known PD evaluation systems. Especially the detection and suppression of stochastically distributed pulse shaped disturbances is a major problem. To determine such disturbances fast machine intelligent recognition systems are being developed. Three different strategies based on digital signal processing are discussed in this paper, while focusing on time resolved neural signal recognition. The system investigated more closely is currently able to distinguish between PD pulses and disturbances with the disturbances values being ten times higher than the peak values of the PD pulses. Therefore a measuring system acquires the input data in the VHF range (20-100 MHz). The discrimination of the pulses is performed in real time in time domain using fast neural network hardware. With that signal recognition system a noise reassessed phase resolved pulse sequence (PRPS) data set in the CIGRE data format is generated that can be the input source of most PD evaluation software.

A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore, to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency.

These features extracted are recognized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned twin support vector machines (TSVM) classifier.

However, traditional fault diagnosis methods usually adopt manual feature extraction, which not only costs expensively and depends on prior knowledge. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of automatic fault identification based on the original vibration signals. Recently, existing studies have shown that most of fault diagnoses are implemented by using deep neural network. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performances, there are obvious limitations in real applications, that is, the complexity of deep neural network requires a lot of hardware computing resources. This hinders the development of online fault diagnosis tools. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet, and realizes an end-to-end intelligent fault classification and diagnosis application.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO.

Based on these factors, researchers have proposed various approaches for early diagnosis. However, the accuracy of proposed techniques and approaches needs certain improvements due to the inherent criticality and life threatening risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Particularly, the framework first deals with the missing values (via mean replacement technique) and data imbalance (via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique - SMOTE). Subsequently, Feature Importance technique is utilized for feature selection.

The validation of framework is performed through three benchmark datasets (i.e. Framingham, Heart Disease and Cleveland) and the accuracies of 99.1%, 98.0% and 95.5 % are achieved respectively. Finally, the comparative analysis proves that MaLCaDD predictions are more accurate (with reduced set of features) as compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information.

The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions.

The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components.

In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%. Our proposed method shows great potential for real-time diagnosis of the epileptic seizures, which can be deployed in hospitals to assist clinicians in accurate diagnosis of seizures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8709668/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax. Thus, the outstanding abilities of deep learning techniques can be deployed for developing robust models for pneumothorax detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9585605/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

The aim of this paper is to reduce user variability in data acquisition by automatically computing a score of echo quality for operator feedback. To do this, a deep convolutional neural network model, trained on a large set of samples, was developed for scoring apical four-chamber (A4C) echo. In this paper, 6,916 end-systolic echo images were manually studied by an expert cardiologist and were assigned a score between 0 (not acceptable) and 5 (excellent). The images were divided into two independent training-validation and test sets. The network architecture and its parameters were based on the stochastic approach of the particle swarm optimization on the training-validation data. The mean absolute error between the scores from the ultimately trained model and the expert's manual scores was 0.71 ± 0.58. The reported error was comparable to the measured intra-rater reliability. The learned features of the network were visually interpretable and could be mapped to the anatomy of the heart in the A4C echo, giving confidence in the training result. The computation time for the proposed network architecture, running on a graphics processing unit, was less than 10 ms per frame, sufficient for real-time deployment. The proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the widespread use of echo at the point-of-care and enable early and timely diagnosis and treatment. Finally, the approach did not use any specific assumptions about the A4C echo, so it could be generalizable to other standard echo views.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7892028/,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,June 2017,ieeexplore

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers—both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios—and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$&gt;$</tex-math></inline-formula> 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art.

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection. We implemented our algorithms and evaluated the system with a large dataset of real-world subjects, including people with dementia, MCI persons, and cognitively healthy people.

To address these, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA).

The intelligent fault diagnosis method has been widely used to accurately diagnose bearing faults. However, in engineering practice, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sample data to train the intelligent diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a fusion diagnosis model CGAN-2-D-CNN that combines a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis with small samples. Considering the problem of insufficient sample data, CGAN is used to learn the data distribution of real samples to generate new samples with similar data distribution by the confrontation training of the generator and discriminator. Then, 2-D preprocessing is conducted to convert the generated 1-D data into 2-D gray images. Finally, these images are input into the 2-D-CNN to extract the features and classify the bearing fault types. Two experimental cases are implemented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CGAN-2-D-CNN. The experimental results illustrate that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method used on the small sample data is close to that of the 2-D-CNN directly used on the enough original sample data whose size is equal to the expanded sample size. In addition, compared with the 1-D-CNN, support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the 2-D-CNN model after 2-D preprocessing has the higher fault classification accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565927/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, we present a deep learning model that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 9.38 ± 0.71 [mg/dL] over a 30-min horizon, RMSE = 18.87 ± 2.25 [mg/dL] over a 60-min horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.07 ± 2.35 [mg/dL] for 30 min, RMSE = 33.27 ± 4.79% for 60 min).

Spam detection methods can be broadly divided into expert-based and machine learning-based detection methods. When experts participate in spam detection, the detection accuracy is fairly high. However, this method is highly time-consuming and expensive. Conversely, methods using machine learning have the advantage of automation, but their accuracy is relatively low. This paper proposes a spam-detection framework that combines and fully exploits the advantages of both methods. To reduce the workload of the experts, all messages are first analyzed via a primary machine learning filter, and those that are determined to be normal messages are allowed through, whereas suspicious messages are flagged. The flagged messages are subsequently analyzed by an expert to enhance the overall system accuracy. In the filtering process, cost-based machine learning is used to prevent the fatal error of misidentifying a spam message as a normal message. In addition, to obviate the continuously evolving spam trends, a module that periodically updates the expert-diagnosis results on the training dataset is incorporated into the framework. The results of experiments conducted, on an imbalanced dataset of spam tweets and normal tweets in a ratio similar to the actual situation in real life, indicate that the proposed framework has a spam-detection rate of almost 92.8%, which is higher than that of the conventional machine learning technique.

However, the performance of such detection algorithms will degrade because of variations between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation of the field. Furthermore, the fault's data in the target domain for model training are usually not available. In this paper, domain adaptation combined with deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN)-based methodology is proposed, where DA-DCGAN first learns an intelligent normal-to-arcing transformation from the source-domain data. Then by generating dummy arcing data with the learned transformation using the normal data from the target domain and employing domain adaptation, a robust and reliable fault diagnosis scheme can be achieved for the target domain. The PV loop current is framed and arranged into a 2D matrix as input for cross-domain DC series arc fault diagnosis. The system is validated offline using pre-recorded PV loop current data from a real 1.5-kW grid-connected rooftop PV system.

Two main contributions are concluded by comparing to the previous works: first, the proposed model can utilize domain adaptation meanwhile strengthening the representative information of the original data, so that a high classification accuracy in the target domain can be achieved, and second, we proposed several strategies to explore the optimal hyperparameters of the model. Experimental results, on several real-world datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness and the reliability of both the proposed model and the exploring strategies for the parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7740016/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,March 2017,ieeexplore

The current 3-D approaches based on convolutional neural networks usually suffer from at least three main issues caused predominantly by implementation constraints-first, they require resizing the volume to the lower-resolutional reference dimensions, and second, the capacity of such approaches is very limited due to memory restrictions, and third, all slices of volumes have to be available at any given training or testing time. We address these problems by a U-Net-like architecture consisting of bidirectional convolutional long short-term memory and convolutional, pooling, upsampling, and concatenation layers enclosed into time-distributed wrappers.

According to the analysts, there is a plausible “PD pandemic” to occur within the next two decades. Nowadays, the research in the area focuses on how to detect, predict, or classify PD and similar diseases without addressing the point of what activities or exercises a subject should do to improve the performance of these tasks. In this article, we propose a method based on machine learning (ML) and wearable sensors to identify the optimal exercises for the efficient detection of PD in patients. We first define 15 common tasks that are typically used to diagnose PD in modern clinical practice. However, these exercises still carry a high risk of misdiagnosis and, moreover, not all of them work well in the scope of existing ML solutions to support the diagnosis. Herein, we collect the data in a real clinical setting using a compact wearable wireless sensor node entailing a board gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer. Application of ML methods to the collected data reveals three “most efficient” exercises to assist diagnosticians with the highest discriminating power (0.9 ROC AUC in each task).

The proposed process is based on pixel neighborhood analysis using only simple arithmetic operations on the image files. This leads to an optimization of the processing speed of the produced image. A first step in the process is to identify and locate the defective pixels on the image. Three defective pixel detection algorithms are proposed. The first one uses the distance between the pixel under test and its neighboring pixels. The second method is based on the median value of the pixel block around each pixel. The third method uses an evaluation and analysis of the local dispersion parameters in the image. The concealment of detected defective pixels is the second step of the self-healing process of image sensor. It consists of substituting the defective value by the median value of the neighborhood pixel block. In the study and learning phase, distorted images obtained by injecting random disturbances into healthy reference images are used to evaluate the defective pixel detection and concealment methods. The set of $1 176$ distorted images is constructed using 196 reference images with six types of defects, based on typical failure mechanism of image sensors.

Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard of detecting OSA, requires multiple specialized sensors for signal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals and bear the costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor alternatives have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience. Among these methods, solutions based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between two consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory balance among comfort, portability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval based OSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy perspectives. As photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped on smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and wristbands), the energy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an overnight observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors are unable to keep collecting continuous signals due to the limited battery capacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore, we propose a novel Frequency Extraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different frequency bands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection results with downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of the one-to-multiple structure, FENet requires only one-third of the operation time of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down the energy consumption and enabling overnight diagnosis.

Here, we introduce the idea of zero-shot learning into the industry field, and tackle the zero-sample fault diagnosis task by proposing the fault description based attribute transfer method. Specifically, the method learns to determine the fault categories using the human-defined fault descriptions instead of the collected fault samples.The defined description consists of arbitrary attributes of the faults, including the fault positions, the consequences of the fault, and even the cause of the fault, etc. For the attribute knowledge of target faults, they can be prelearned and transferred from some readily available faults occurred in the same process. Afterwards, the target faults can be diagnosed based on the defined fault descriptions without the need for any additional data based training. Besides, the supervised principle component analysis is adopted in our method to extract the attribute related features to offer an effective attribute learning. We analyze and interpret the feasibility of the fault description based method theoretically. Also, the zero-sample fault diagnosis experiments are designed and conducted on the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process and the real thermal power plant process to validate the effectiveness.

Different from native real-valued negative selection algorithm (RNSA) that operates in original data space, this algorithm utilizes feature space transformation and diversity factor-based GA for optimized detector distribution in nonself feature space. The proposed framework comprises three stages namely; feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and GA optimized AIS. In the first stage, signal processing methods are applied to extract multidomain features (time-domain statistical, frequency domain statistical, and special features) of the system. In the second stage, two unsupervised methods namely, k-NN clustering and pretraining using deep learning neural network are proposed for dominant fault-characterizing feature selection. Finally, in the third stage, the fault-characterizing feature vectors are used for system status categorization (i.e., normal, fault) using selected (fault-characterizing) features-based AIS method. The efficacy of the proposed framework is verified through experiments on motor bearing fault detection using vibration signal. The major accomplishment of the proposed combination of space transformation, feature selection and AIS (anomaly classification) techniques is the alleviation of computational burden on RNSA implementation.

However, many of existing DL methods fail in relationship mining between signals explicitly. Unlike those deep neural networks, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) taking graph data with topological structure as input is more efficient for data relationship mining, making GCN to be powerful for feature representation from graph data in non-Euclidean space. Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation. To address these issues, a multireceptive field graph convolutional network (MRF-GCN) is proposed for effective intelligent fault diagnosis. In MRF-GCN, data samples are converted into weighted graphs to indicate differences in relationship of data samples. Moreover, MRF-GCN learns not only features from different receptive field, but also fuses learned features as an enhanced feature representation. To verify the efficacy of MRF-GCN for machine fault diagnosis, case studies are implemented, and the results show that MRF-GCN can achieve superior performance even under imbalanced dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280401/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

The problem becomes more challenging when the sensor channels are not synchronized because of different sampling rates used and/or time-varying operational schemes. This paper provides a nonparametric sensor recovery technique and a semi-parametric alternative to enhance the robustness of multichannel CM systems.

Such performance variations can lead to failures and inefficiencies, which impact the cost and resilience of HPC systems. To minimize the impact of performance variations, one must quickly and accurately detect and diagnose the anomalies that cause the variations and take mitigating actions. However, it is difficult to identify anomalies based on the voluminous, high-dimensional, and noisy data collected by system monitoring infrastructures. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to automatically diagnose performance anomalies at runtime. Our framework leverages historical resource usage data to extract signatures of previously-observed anomalies. We first convert collected time series data into easy-to-compute statistical features. We then identify the features that are required to detect anomalies, and extract the signatures of these anomalies. At runtime, we use these signatures to diagnose anomalies with negligible overhead.

However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings. Experimental results on the benchmark tasks show that PKRLS obtains a parsimonious network structure with the satisfactory prediction accuracy.

Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

Lower computation time and better accuracy achieved depict the effectiveness of the proposed method to be used in real-time diagnosis of cardiorespiratory diseases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8733864/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2019",ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095391,Studying the Applicability of Generative Adversarial Networks on HEp-2 Cell Image Augmentation,IEEE,Journals,"The Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANAs) testing is the primary serological diagnosis screening test for autoimmune diseases. ANAs testing is conducted mainly by the Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) on Human Epithelial cell-substrate (HEp-2) protocol. However, due to its high variability, human-subjectivity, and low throughput, there is an insistent need to develop an efficient Computer-Aided Diagnosis system (CADs) to automate this protocol. Many recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrated promising results in HEp-2 cell image classification, which is the main task of the HE-p2 IIF protocol. However, the lack of large labeled datasets is still the main challenge in this field. This work provides a detailed study of the applicability of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) algorithms as an augmentation method. Different types of GANs were employed to synthesize HEp-2 cell images to address the data scarcity problem. For systematic comparison, empirical quantitative metrics were implemented to evaluate different GAN models' performance of learning the real data representations. The results of this work showed that though the high visual similarity with the real images, GANs' capacity to generate diverse data is still limited. This deficiency in the generated data diversity is found to be of a crucial impact when used as a standalone method for augmentation. However, combining limited-size GANs-generated data with classic augmentation improves the classification accuracy across different variants of CNNs. Our results demonstrated a competitive performance for the overall classification accuracy and the mean class accuracy of the HEp-2 cell image classification task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9475986/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TPAMI.2006.23,Symbolic signatures for deformable shapes,IEEE,Journals,"Recognizing classes of objects from their shape is an unsolved problem in machine vision that entails the ability of a computer system to represent and generalize complex geometrical information on the basis of a finite amount of prior data. A practical approach to this problem is particularly difficult to implement, not only because the shape variability of relevant object classes is generally large, but also because standard sensing devices used to capture the real world only provide a partial view of a scene, so there is partial information pertaining to the objects of interest. In this work, we develop an algorithmic framework for recognizing classes of deformable shapes from range data. The basic idea of our component-based approach is to generalize existing surface representations that have proven effective in recognizing specific 3D objects to the problem of object classes using our newly introduced symbolic-signature representation that is robust to deformations, as opposed to a numeric representation that is often tied to a specific shape. Based on this approach, we present a system that is capable of recognizing and classifying a variety of object shape classes from range data. We demonstrate our system in a series of large-scale experiments that were motivated by specific applications in scene analysis and medical diagnosis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1542033/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Jan. 2006,ieeexplore
10.1109/TBME.2005.869776,Telephony-based voice pathology assessment using automated speech analysis,IEEE,Journals,"A system for remotely detecting vocal fold pathologies using telephone-quality speech is presented. The system uses a linear classifier, processing measurements of pitch perturbation, amplitude perturbation and harmonic-to-noise ratio derived from digitized speech recordings. Voice recordings from the Disordered Voice Database Model 4337 system were used to develop and validate the system. Results show that while a sustained phonation, recorded in a controlled environment, can be classified as normal or pathologic with accuracy of 89.1%, telephone-quality speech can be classified as normal or pathologic with an accuracy of 74.2%, using the same scheme. Amplitude perturbation features prove most robust for telephone-quality speech. The pathologic recordings were then subcategorized into four groups, comprising normal, neuromuscular pathologic, physical pathologic and mixed (neuromuscular with physical) pathologic. A separate classifier was developed for classifying the normal group from each pathologic subcategory. Results show that neuromuscular disorders could be detected remotely with an accuracy of 87%, physical abnormalities with an accuracy of 78% and mixed pathology voice with an accuracy of 61%. This study highlights the real possibility for remote detection and diagnosis of voice pathology.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1597497/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,March 2006,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933437,The OCS-SVM: An Objective-Cost-Sensitive SVM With Sample-Based Misclassification Cost Invariance,IEEE,Journals,"Studies on the traditional support vector machine (SVM) implicitly assume that the costs of different types of mistakes are the same and minimize the error rate. On the one hand, it is not enough for many practical applications to rely solely on the error rate, which reflects only the average classification ability of a classifier. It is also of great significance to consider the performance of classifiers from the perspective of each sample. On the other hand, many real-world problems, such as credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, oil-spill detection and cancer diagnosis, usually involve substantially unequal misclassification costs. To solve this problem, many works on the cost-sensitive SVM (CS-SVM) have emerged. The misclassification costs for this model are generally provided by domain experts. Inspired by the concept of the CS-SVM, we propose a new SVM with sample-based misclassification cost invariance with the aim of constructing a relatively reliable classifier. The relatively reliable classifier is defined as the one with low probabilities of finding a classifier that correctly classifies each misclassified sample. Note that the cost is determined by the inherent characteristics of each sample rather than being subjectively assigned, so we denote the proposed classifier as the objective-cost-sensitive SVM (OCS-SVM). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with nine other commonly used classifiers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8789540/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2963939,Towards Real-Time Computing of Intraoperative Hyperspectral Imaging for Brain Cancer Detection Using Multi-GPU Platforms,IEEE,Journals,"Several causes make brain cancer identification a challenging task for neurosurgeons during the surgical procedure. The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949497/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/JSEN.2021.3096641,Wireless Channel Modelling for Identifying Six Types of Respiratory Patterns With SDR Sensing and Deep Multilayer Perceptron,IEEE,Journals,"Contactless or non-invasive technology has a significant impact on healthcare applications such as the prediction of COVID-19 symptoms. Non-invasive methods are essential especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as they minimise the burden on healthcare personnel. One notable symptom of COVID-19 infection is a rapid respiratory rate, which requires constant real-time monitoring of respiratory patterns. In this paper, Software Defined Radio (SDR) based Radio-Frequency sensing technique and supervised machine learning algorithm is employed to provide a platform for detecting and monitoring various respiratory: eupnea, biot, bradypnea, sighing, tachypnea, and kussmaul. The variations in Channel State Information produced by human respiratory were utilised to identify distinct respiratory patterns using fine-grained Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing signals. The proposed platform based on the SDR and the Deep Multilayer Perceptron classifier exhibits the ability to effectively detect and classify the afore-mentioned distinct respiratory with an accuracy of up to 99%. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of diagnosis accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix is demonstrated by comparison with a state-of-the-art machine learning classifier: Random Forest.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9481241/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"15 Sept.15, 2021",ieeexplore
