Especially for the cultivation of industrial tomato, harvest is conducted when the total soluble solids, a major quality characteristic, are as high as possible. Advancements in technology have made Decision Support Systems simpler and more applicable in an everyday basis. Data Analysis, combined with Machine Learning algorithms are considered the future of sustainable agriculture, allowing farmers to be advised about the best possible decisions for their cultivation. Farmers need to adopt this kind of technology in order to be able to know when the quality of tomatoes is at its peak, in order to gather their product from the field. The implementation of a Decision Support System to predict the total soluble solids was conducted,based on data from previous years, including quality data (pH, Bostwick, L, a/b, Mean Weight, °Brix), the type of hybrid used, weather data and soil data from the fields. Data derived from fields in 6 different regions in the northwestern Peloponnese, Greece over 6 cultivation periods, created a dataset of 33 different inputs. Thirteen different algorithms were put into evaluation in order to find the best one in terms of speed and efficiency. In this research, we developed a Decision Support System using the K-nearest algorithm, which proved to be the best for our dataset. The predicted °Brix were following the same pattern as the actual °Brix. This means that the DSS could advise the farmer about the ideal harvesting period where the °Brix will be maximized. This DSS which is using real time weather data as an input is expected to be a valuable tool for the farmers.",industry

The shield tail clearance measurement and monitoring technology development is still in its infancy, the current methods are mainly designed manually based on intuition. In order to fill the gap between the requirement of shield tail clearance measurement and monitoring and the limitations of the current methods, this paper systematically studies the existing mechanisms related to shield tail clearance measurement and monitoring, and develops a high-precision intelligent monitoring system for shield tail clearance. The proposed monitoring system includes four components: 1) two types of shield tail clearance calculation models, 2) the integrated hardware of the monitoring system which is composed of a data acquisition unit, a signal transmission unit and a control unit, 3) the region of interest (ROI) extraction method based on deep neural network, and the image processing algorithms for image enhancement and feature extraction, 4) the custom-developed software built on mature integrated development environment (IDE). After the calculation model of shield tail clearance is established, the system uses monitoring devices equipped with industrial cameras to obtain the on-site image, and then applies image processing technologies along with deep learning approach to extract the key features, which are brought into the model to calculate the values of shield tail clearance, finally displays these values and simulates the current tunneling attitude of the shield machine in real time. The experimental results show that the system proposed in this paper achieves the goal of high precision measuring and real-time monitoring of the shield tail clearance.",industry

Additionally, it is a complex multi-criteria problem due to the need to optimize overall energy use while satisfying users’ comfort. Both conventional rule-based (RB) controllers, which are difficult to apply in multi-loop settings, and advanced model-based controllers, which require an accurate building model, cannot fulfil the requirements of the building automation industry to solve this problem optimally at low development and commissioning costs. This work presents a fully data-driven pipeline to obtain an optimal control policy from historical building and weather data, thus avoiding the need for complex physics-based modelling. We demonstrate the potential of this method by jointly controlling a room temperature and an EV to minimize the cost of electricity while retaining the comfort of the occupants. We model the room temperature with a recurrent neural network and use it as a simulation environment to learn a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control policy. It achieves on average 17% energy savings and 19% better comfort satisfaction than a standard RB room temperature controller. When a bidirectional EV is connected additionally and a two-tariff electricity pricing is applied, it successfully leverages the battery and decreases the overall cost of electricity. Finally, we deployed it on a real building, where it achieved up to 30% energy savings while maintaining similar comfort levels compared to a conventional RB room temperature controller.",industry

Thus, the new industrial paradigm of Industry 4.0 has gained interest worldwide, leading many manufacturers to a significant digital transformation. Digital technologies have enabled a novel approach to decision-making processes based on data-driven strategies, where knowledge extraction relies on the analysis of a large amount of data from sensor-equipped factories. In this context, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) based on Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent data-driven analytical approaches for monitoring industrial systems aiming to maximise reliability and efficiency. In fact, PdM aims not only to reduce equipment failure rates but also to minimise operating costs by maximising equipment life. When considering industrial applications, industries deal with different issues and constraints relating to process digitalisation. The main purpose of this study is to develop a new decision support system based on decision trees (DTs) that guides the decision-making process of PdM implementation, considering context-aware information, quality and maturity of collected data, severity, occurrence and detectability of potential failures (identified through FMECA analysis) and direct and indirect maintenance costs. The decision trees allow the study of different scenarios to identify the conditions under which a PdM policy, based on the ML algorithm, is economically profitable compared to corrective maintenance, considered to be the current scenario. The results show that the proposed methodology is a simple and easy way to implement tool to support the decision process by assessing the different levels of occurrence and severity of failures. For each level, savings and the potential costs have been evaluated at leaf nodes of the trees aimed at defining the most suitable maintenance strategy implementation. Finally, the proposed DTs are applied to a real industrial case to illustrate their applicability and robustness.",industry

The advantages range from ease of installation and maintenance to reduced deployment time and infrastructure costs. However, industrial automation has critical requirements regarding network infrastructure, such as reliability and failure tolerance. Therefore, it is imperative to have an adequate placement of sensor and router nodes, to obtain a network with multiple paths, allowing the data to reach management systems within a reasonable time, even in the event of failures. The placement of router nodes has to consider latency, network lifespan, connectivity, and failure tolerance aspects in a possibly hostile environment, with classified areas and obstacles such as silos, tanks and buildings. We present a new approach, called POSIMNET-R, to place IWSN routing nodes in an industrial configuration, which circumvents forbidden areas and obstacles, based on Artificial Immunological Networks. The resulting network offers low failure rates and path redundancy criteria. The results have shown that POSIMNET-R was capable of providing a reliable network with multiple paths and resilience of the used routers equal to 81.50% in the basic case study and 73.66% in the real case scenario.",industry

Deep learning methods, especially CNN and FCN, shows competitive performance in TSC task by their virtue of good adaption for raw time series and self-adapting extraction of features. Then various variants of CNN are proposed so as to make further breakthrough by the better perception to characteristics of data.

The gate-based network LSTM naturally fits to various terms time dependencies, and FCN with multi-scale sets of filters are capable to perceive spatial features of different range from time series curves. Besides, dilation convolution is deployed to build multi-scale receptive fields in larger level without increasing the parameters to be trained.

Modern aerial vehicles are designed to receive actuator commands from the primary autopilot software as input to regulate their servos for adjusting control surfaces. Due to real-time interaction with the actual physical environment, there exists a high risk of control surface failures for engine, rudder, elevators, and ailerons etc. If not anticipated and then timely controlled, failures occurring during the flight can have severe and cataclysmic consequences, which may result in mid-air collision or ultimate crash. Humongous amount of sensory data being generated throughout mission-critical flights, makes it an ideal candidate for applying advanced data-driven machine learning techniques to identify intelligent insights related to failures for instant recovery from emergencies. In this paper, we present a novel framework based on machine learning techniques for failure prediction, detection, and classification for autonomous aerial vehicles. The proposed framework utilizes long short-term memory recurrent neural network architecture to analyze time series data and has been applied at the AirLab Failure and Anomaly flight dataset, which is a comprehensive publicly available dataset of various fault types in fixed-wing autonomous aerial vehicles’ control surfaces.

Determining them by their respective reference methods, however, is laborious, expensive, and time consuming. To overcome this, we developed a new analytical instrument called Solids in Wastewater's Machine Vision-based Automatic Analyzer (SWAMVA), which is equiped with an automatic sampler and a software for real-time digital movie capture to quantify sequentially the TSS and SetS contents in wastewater samples. The machine vision algorithm (MVA) coupled with the Red color plane (derived from color histograms in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) system) showed the best prediction results with R2 of 0.988 and 0.964, and relative error of prediction (REP) of 6.133 and 9.115% for TSS and SetS, respectively. The constructed models were validated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the accuracy and precision of the predictions by the t- and F-tests, respectively, at a 0.05 significance level. The elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test confirmed the accuracy, while the coefficient of variation (CV) of 6.529 and 10.908% confirmed the good precisions, respectively. Compared with the reference method (Standard Methods For the Examination of Water and Wastewater), the proposed method reduced the analysis volume from 1.5 L to just 15 mL and the analysis time from 12 h to 24 s per sample.

The cost of hydrogen consumption and the lifetime of fuel cells are currently the main challenges that need to be addressed before widespread deployment of fuel cell railway vehicles can be realized. With this in mind, this work focuses on the energy management system with emphasis on optimizing the energy distribution to reduce the overall operational cost. The presented energy management strategy (EMS) aims at minimizing hydrogen consumption and fuel cell aging costs while achieving a favorable balance between battery charging and discharging. In order to take fuel cell aging into account in energy management and mitigate fuel cell aging trough power distribution, an online fuel cell aging estimation model based on four operation modes is introduced and applied. Moreover, the advanced deep reinforcement learning method Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) is used to obtain a promising EMS. To improve the adaptability of the strategy, a stochastic training environment, which is based on real measured speed profiles considering passenger numbers is used for training. Assuming different environmental and passenger transport volumes, the results confirm that the proposed TD3-EMS achieves battery charge-sustaining at low hydrogen consumption while slowing down fuel cell degradation.",industry

Maintenance and spare parts inventory management play a vital role in achieving these goals, and preventive maintenance has increasingly been considered in maintenance policies. Additive manufacturing (AM) has recently been combined with preventive maintenance, and thus represents an emerging research direction. However, few studies have as yet been conducted in this research stream, and we intend to fill this gap. Our study makes three main contributions. First, we address the main limitations of two current models (i.e., assuming that no failure occurs during the replenishment lead time of the spare parts). Second, we propose a new maintenance policy that considers two printing options with different levels of reliability and unitary purchase costs. Third, we develop a decision support system (DSS) to assist managers in deciding whether to implement a preventive maintenance policy that includes AM or conventional manufacturing (CM) parts. We take an interdisciplinary approach to conducting a parametrical analysis where we consider real data on the reliability of CM and AM parts, in addition to the impact of post-processing operations and optimization routines. We find that AM-based preventive maintenance policies are favored when the MTTF and the backorder costs are low and when the failure and maintenance costs are high. These findings have been incorporated into the DSS, which provides thresholds for every parameter to guide practitioners in choosing between AM and CM parts for preventive maintenance, without requiring time-expensive calculations.",industry

However, as most current and commercial AVs are closed-source solutions, in practice, little is known about their real internals: information such as what is a typical AV database size, the detection methods effectively used in each operation mode, and how often on average the AVs are updated are still unknown. This prevents research work from meeting the industrial practices more thoroughly. To fill this gap, in this work, we systematize the knowledge about AVs. To do so, we first surveyed the literature and identified existing knowledge gaps in AV internals’ working. Further, we bridged these gaps by analyzing popular (Windows, Linux, and Android) AV solutions to check their operations in practice. Our methodology encompassed multiple techniques, from tracing to fuzzing. We detail current AV’s architecture, including their multiple components, such as browser extensions and injected libraries, regarding their implementation, monitoring features, and self-protection capabilities. We discovered, for instance, a great disparity in the set of API functions hooked by the distinct AV’s libraries, which might have a significant impact in the viability of academically-proposed detection models (e.g., machine learning-based ones).",industry

How the most relevant technologies and Information Systems are used by the Port Communities for their businesses is discussed together with a detailed analysis of the on-going actions carried on by Standard Setting Organizations. Considering the examples given by the C-ITS Platform and the C-Roads programme at EU level, a proposal of contents to be considered in a comprehensive standardization action is given. The innovation services are therefore grouped into four bundles: (i) Vessel & Marine Navigation, (ii) e-Freight & (Intermodal) Logistics, (iii) Passenger Transport, (iv) Environmental sustainability. The standardized version of these applications will be finally labeled as C-Port services. Alongside the standardization plan, a proposal for ranking the ports on the basis of a specially-defined C-Port vector is discussed with the purpose of addressing the well-known lack of consensus around the mathematical definition of the Smart Port Index. Considering the good practice and the background offered by the Port of Livorno in terms of innovation actions, the prospected final user applications are then labeled as Day 1, Day 1.5, and Day 2 services in consideration of the technical and commercial gaps to be filled. As a case study about the evolution in the C-Port vector experienced by the Port of Livorno in the last years will also be discussed.",industry

Aiming to sustain competitive advantage and intensify customer loyalty, full-service providers offer the use of their products as a service to achieve continuous revenues. For this purpose, companies implement AI classification algorithms to enable high levels of service at controllable costs. However, traditional asset sellers who become service providers require previously atypical payment structures, as classic payment methods involving a one-time fee for production costs and profit margins are unsuitable. In addition, a low predictive power of the implemented classification algorithm can lead to misclassifications, which diminish the achievable level of service and the intended net present value of the resultant service. While previous works focus solely on the costs of such misclassifications, our decision model highlights implications for payment structures, service levels, and – ultimately – the net present value of such data-driven service offerings. Our research suggests that predictive power can be a major factor in selecting a suitable payment structure and the overall design of service level agreements. Therefore, we compare common payment structures for data-driven services and investigate their relationship to predictive power. We develop our model using a design science methodology and iteratively evaluate our results using a four-step approach that includes interviews with industry experts and the application of our model to a real-world use case. In summary, our research extends the existing knowledge of servitization and data-driven services in the manufacturing industry through a quantitative decision model.",industry
