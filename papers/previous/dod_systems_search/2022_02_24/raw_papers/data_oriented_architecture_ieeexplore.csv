10.1109/ICCDA.2010.5540715,Data-oriented architecture for double and single bits error correction using Cycle Redundancy Code,IEEE,Conferences,"Error occurs during transferring, storing and retrieving data. Thus error detection and correction is a necessary technique in information technology. Cycle Redundancy Code, CRC, is a common method in error detection. A new method based on data-oriented theory for single and double bit errors correction by using CRC is presented. The conceptual model of presented method as data-oriented architecture is designed to implement it with hardware. This method is able to determine the exact place of one and two bits in error and correct them. In a way, nonzero calculated remainder on receiver is compared with remainder field of the content of Problem Solution Data Structure, PSDS, to find the error location, as a solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5540715/,2010 International Conference On Computer Design and Applications,25-27 June 2010,ieeexplore

10.1109/CSE.2014.128,Exploring the Benefits of Introducing Network Coding into Named Data Networking,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, the focus to optimize network transmission efficiency has evolved to adopt methods that let those intermediate data transferring nodes get involved with routing, forwarding and caching. In other words, the new network architecture designs become in favor of hop-to-hop model, instead of traditional TCP-like end-to-end model. Named data networking is a promising future internet data oriented architecture which uses names instead of addresses and exchanges or forwards interest/data pair packets at each node along the path to route data for delivery. And meanwhile Network coding (NC) is a content oriented and effective method to reduce redundancy, increase network throughput and improve robustness. Nonetheless, due to NDN's current preliminary research, less research has combined these two technologies together. This paper presents some new thoughts to study on the benefits brought by integrating network coding to NDN, which can effectively improve network utilization, strengthen caching privacy, and also promote development of the NDN architecture itself.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7023638/,2014 IEEE 17th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering,19-21 Dec. 2014,ieeexplore

10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2645768,Broadcast-Based Content Delivery in Information-Centric Hybrid Multihop Wireless Networks,IEEE,Journals,"Information-centric networking is a “data-oriented” architecture for Future Internet. Since unicast routing cannot exploit the natural broadcast property of wireless networks and unicast paths may be broken down frequently due to node mobility, broadcast transmission is applied for content delivery in information-centric multihop wireless networks. It will face two key challenges: which nodes that receive the broadcasted packet should forward it, and how to avoid multiple nodes simultaneously transmitting it. In this letter, we solve these two issues by taking node mobility and available link capacity into account. A mobility-based forward node selection algorithm is proposed, which tends to select the less mobility nodes as the forward ones. An available link capacity-based forwarding scheme is proposed, which tends to select forward nodes with larger available link capacities to forward packets. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7801039/,IEEE Communications Letters,April 2017,ieeexplore
