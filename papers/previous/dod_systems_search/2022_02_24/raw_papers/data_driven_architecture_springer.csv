However, the cost of whole exome sequencing limits the widespread use of such biomarkers. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework for the design of targeted gene panels for estimating a broad class of biomarkers including tumour mutation burden and tumour indel burden. Our first goal is to develop a generative model for the profile of mutation across the exome, which allows for gene- and variant type-dependent mutation rates. Based on this model, we then propose a procedure for constructing biomarker estimators. Our approach allows the practitioner to select a targeted gene panel of prespecified size and construct an estimator that only depends on the selected genes. Alternatively, our method may be applied to make predictions based on an existing gene panel, or to augment a gene panel to a given size. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposal using data from three non small-cell lung cancer studies, as well as data from six other cancer types. A data-driven procedure to estimate immunotherapy biomarkers is shown to perform well on data from three Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer studies as well as data from six other cancer types. The method is based on a generative model of how mutations arise in the tumour exome.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03098-1,springer

However, owing to challenging dynamic engineering practices, the suspension bridges, in particular, require accumulated design and construction technologies. Moreover, as the most distinctive mechanical property of the cable structures, different applied tension generates different lateral stiffness on the main cable. Without an integrated analysis model, the realistic profile of the cable structures cannot be determined. In this regard, this paper proposes a master digital model for a suspension bridge based on the data-driven approach for multiple purposes, including the structural assessment aspect. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technique is a key factor to creating and federate all the essential engineering knowledge data regarding a suspension bridge. At first, a data schema for the suspension bridge’s main structures is created and based on that, the database for each structural member is defined. The BIM authoring using the data-driven design is proposed to generate all the individual structural members then assembly to make the entire initial model for the suspension bridge. Metadata is linked, and any efficient revisions concerning varying situations during the construction process can be easily updated into the digital model through the change of database. Finally, an analysis model is integrated into this initial model to create the federated master digital model. The advantage of this master digital model lies in the capability to continuously perform the bridge system’s stability analyses at any erection step. Furthermore, it makes the digital representation of the main cable and suspended bridge structures more dynamic, no longer just rigid objects in the general commercial BIM model. A prototyping master digital model was developed for an existing bridge is introduced along with this paper.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-7160-9_182,springer

Using data from two crowdfunding sites (Kickstarter and Indiegogo), we summarize the applications, forms, prices, contexts of use, target populations, and sociality of potential consumer and home robots. We then use statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and word co-occurrence to determine which characteristics are associated with increased product support by early market consumers, finding that health and fitness, security and monitoring, and general education applications, cartoon-like and animal-like robot forms, and single user group robots have significantly more backers. We also find that social robots have a mean of 1.2–3.2 times as many backers as non-social robots and that every twofold increase in price results in a 20% decrease in financial supporters. Product reviews from these sites are additionally used to identify product features consumers found important. Finally, analyses of the failure rates of social and home robots find that these products are not failing more frequently than other innovative products overall. This research is among the first to study factors influencing consumers’ purchasing behavior of home robots, and to use data mining methods to gain insights into home and consumer robot design.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12369-021-00776-8,springer

The background, motivation, and significance of data-driven engineering design are elaborated. From a theoretical perspective, data-driven engineering design is characterized by a novel integration between the existing design theory and methodology with the emerging data science. Therefore, a systematic design process is divided into multiple key design operations, and a complete data lifecycle is divided into multiple data operations.

It is schemed to obtain high-performance material distributions from initially given material distributions in a given design domain. Its basic idea is to iterate the following processes: (i) selecting material distributions from a dataset of material distributions according to eliteness, (ii) generating new material distributions using a deep generative model trained with the selected elite material distributions, and (iii) merging the generated material distributions with the dataset. Because of the nature of a deep generative model, the generated material distributions are diverse and inherit features of the training data, that is, the elite material distributions. Therefore, it is expected that some of the generated material distributions are superior to the current elite material distributions, and by merging the generated material distributions with the dataset, the performances of the newly selected elite material distributions are improved. The performances are further improved by iterating the above processes. The usefulness of data-driven topology design is demonstrated through numerical examples.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00158-021-02926-y,springer

In the present work, we achieve this goal using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). The method enables us to analyze the relationship between aerodynamic performance and the shape of aerodynamic parts, and to explore new designs for the parts. In the CVAE model, a shape is fed as an input and the corresponding aerodynamic performance index is fed as a continuous label. Then, shapes are generated by specifying the continuous label and latent vector. When CVAE is applied to mechanical design, it is desired to draw shapes that reproduce the specified aerodynamic performance. In ordinal CVAE, the model is trained to minimize reconstruction loss and latent loss, and it is usually optimized considering the sum of these losses. However, the present study shows that the optimal network is not always optimal in terms of reproducing the aerodynamic performance. The proposed method is verified using two numerical examples: a two-dimensional (2D) airfoil and a turbine blade. In the airfoil example, we demonstrate the effects of latent dimension, and in the turbine design example, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to a real turbine design problem and reduce the design time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00158-021-02851-0,springer

Currently, online auctioneers rely heavily on their experts in auction design. The ability of predicting how well an auction will perform prior to the start comes in handy for auctioneers. If an item is expected to be a low-performing item, the auctioneer can take certain actions to influence the auction outcome. For instance, the starting selling price of the item can be modified, or the location where the item is displayed on the website can be changed to attract more attention. In this paper, we take a real-world industrial auction data set and investigate how we can improve upon the expert’s design using insights learned from data. More specifically, we first construct a classification model that predicts the expected performance of auctions. We propose a data driven auction design framework (called DDAD) that combines the expert’s knowledge with the learned prediction model, in order to find the best parameter values, i.e., starting price and display positions of the items, for a given new auction. The prediction model is evaluated, and the new design for several auctions is discussed and validated with the auction experts.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10472-020-09722-2,springer

Clever solutions address this issue by inducing sparsity through low-rank approximations, often based on the Nystrom method. Here, we propose a different method to achieve better scalability and higher accuracy using quantum computing, outperforming classical Bayesian neural networks for large datasets significantly. Unlike other approaches to quantum machine learning, the computationally expensive linear algebra operations are not just replaced with their quantum counterparts. Instead, we start from a recent study that proposed a quantum circuit for implementing quantum Gaussian processes and then we use quantum phase estimation to induce a low-rank approximation analogous to that in classical sparse Gaussian processes. We provide evidence through numerical tests, mathematical error bound estimation, and complexity analysis that the method can address the “curse of dimensionality,” where each additional input parameter no longer leads to an exponential growth of the computational cost. This is also demonstrated by applying the algorithm in a practical setting and using it in the data-driven design of a recently proposed metamaterial. The algorithm, however, requires significant quantum computing hardware improvements before quantum advantage can be achieved.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s42484-020-00032-8,springer

One is the mode of intervention, which can range from providing expert knowledge to the client to engaging in a collaborative process. The second dimension is the number of people involved in the design process, which can range from just a few members of the leadership team to groups of up to thousands (in so-called large group interventions). The approach described here uses a collaborative approach that engages a design team of a manageable size. The design team represents the organization and is mandated by the leadership team to perform the design work. Elements of approaches from other design disciplines can offer useful inspiration for the organization design approach, such as the importance of prototyping and testing. Still, a lot of challenging aspects of the design process remain, especially having to do with the inevitable political aspects at play. Data-driven tools that support the organization design process are increasingly on offer.

By analyzing the generated data, it is possible to create optimized outputs for structures in an iterative process, until reaching a solution that satisfies the project constraints. Often, it is challenging to conciliate optimization with issuing of intermediate versions to be used for project coordination by other stakeholders. This is due to recurrent project changes, related to architectural or client requirements that arise during the design process. Moreover, structural design is generally carried out in a variety of software by different engineers within the design team. Therefore, it is rather challenging to organize, control and analyze all the information generated in structural design at each step, aiming to enhance both general team efficiency and structural optimization. The increasing popularity of BIM (Building Information Modeling) in this field could be a pivoting factor towards data-driven design and informed decision-making in all levels of a structural project team. In this context, this paper presents a proposal and an application of a BIM data workflow to enhance the work of structural designers as well as the collaboration within the design team. The workflow is based on data extraction through visual programming, using Dynamo, and the creation of an automatically updatable dashboard within Power BI. Python is used to create custom-build operations that apply specifically to the structural assessment context.

As a result, unit cells are either assumed to be repeated (periodic) everywhere or limited to a small number of shapes. To address these limitations, this work proposes a data-driven design framework consisting of a metamaterial genome with a reduced-order geometrical representation as well as methods for the efficient design and analysis of 2D aperiodic metamaterials with compatible boundaries. To collect a large amount of designs, a set of unit cells generated by topology optimization is taken as initial seeds for the genome, and then expanded iteratively through random shape perturbations to form a rich database that covers a wide range of properties. For a reduced-order representation, the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) spectrum is adopted to describe complex unit cell shapes using a low number of descriptors, therefore significantly reducing the design dimensionality. Moreover, the physical and geometrical information contained in the LB spectrum is revealed through both quantitative and theoretical analysis. This information as well as the lower dimensionality allows the genome to be effectively leveraged to build a neural network model of structure-property relations for the rapid design of new unit cells. Finally, the combination of the metamaterial genome with an efficient optimization method based on the Markov random field (MRF) model is proposed to ensure connected boundaries between unit cells in multiscale aperiodic microstructure designs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00158-020-02523-5,springer

Two design variables are considered for each lattice substructure, one discrete variable indicating the configuration type and the other continuous density variable determining the geometrical feature size. For each lattice configuration, a series of similar lattice substructures are sampled by varying the density variable and a corresponding data-driven interpolation model is built for an explicit representation of the constitutive behavior. To reduce the model complexity, substructuring by means of static condensation is performed on the sampled lattice substructures. To achieve hybrid structure with multiple lattice configurations, a multi-material interpolation model is adopted by synthesizing the data-driven interpolation models and the discrete lattice configuration variables. The proposed approach has proved capable of generating hierarchically strongly coupled designs, which therefore allows for direct manufacturing with no post-processing requirement as required for homogenization-based designs due to the assumption on scales separation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00158-020-02497-4,springer

With this respect, a method is proposed addressing the business and data understanding in industrial contexts and corresponding Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) environments. This allows to identify use cases for data-driven design taking into account business processes as well as the related data.

The analysis will allow to promote social relations by enhancing the facility’s spaces and activities, with the ultimate objective of improving residents’ quality of life. To assess social wellness and evaluate the effectiveness of the village areas and activities, this work introduces measures of sociability for both residents and places. Our data analysis is based on classical statistical methods and innovative machine learning techniques. First, we analyze the correlation between relational indicators and factors such as the outdoor temperature and the patients’ movements inside the facility. Then, we use statistical and accessibility analyses to determine the spaces residents appreciate the most and those in need of enhancements. We observe that patients’ sociability is strongly related to the considered factors. From our analysis, outdoor areas result less frequented and need spatial redesign to promote accessibility and attendance among patients. The data awareness obtained from our analysis will also be of great help to caregivers, doctors, and psychologists to enhance assisted care home social activities, adjust patient-specific treatments, and deepen the comprehension of the disease.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-58805-2_46,springer

Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies that can mitigate current CO_2 emissions^ 2 , much effort is focused on developing solid adsorbents that can efficiently capture CO_2 from flue gases emitted from anthropogenic sources^ 3 . One class of materials that has attracted considerable interest in this context is metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful combination of organic ligands with metal-ion nodes can, in principle, give rise to innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO_2 from nitrogen^ 4 – 7 do not perform well when using realistic flue gas that contains water, because water competes with CO_2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their selectivity. Although flue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process prohibitively expensive^ 8 , 9 . Here we show that data mining of a computational screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify different classes of strong CO_2-binding sites—which we term ‘adsorbaphores’—that endow MOFs with CO_2/N_2 selectivity that persists in wet flue gases. We subsequently synthesized two water-stable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their carbon-capture performance is not affected by water and outperforms that of some commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting and consideration of the full capture process—including the targeted CO_2 sink, such as geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industry—will be necessary to identify the optimal separation material. Data mining of a computational library of metal–organic frameworks identifies motifs that bind CO_2 sufficiently strongly and whose uptake is not affected by water, with application for the capture of CO_2 from flue gases.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1798-7,springer

However, a small sample size and cognitive limitation of a researcher demand more data to model persona better. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a data-driven framework for designing customer service chatbot that utilizes the past customer behavior data from clickstreams and a customer service chatbot.

These early endeavors seem to present some essential limitations related mainly to scalability and uptake. In order to avoid these limitations, we introduce a two-phased approach for supporting participatory decision-making based on the integration and analysis of social and government open data. The proposed approach is based on the literature related to the analysis of massive amounts of social data for future events prediction. In this paper we also present a Web data driven architecture for the implementation of the proposed approach. The architecture is based on the use of linked data paradigm as a layer that will enable integration of data from different sources. We anticipate that the proposed approach will (i) allow decision makers to understand and predict public opinion and reaction about specific decisions; and (ii) enable citizens to inadvertently contribute in decision-making.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-23333-3_4,springer

This work proposes an environment for exploration and simulation of coarse-grain reconfigurable data-driven architectures. The proposed environment takes advantage of Java and XML technologies to enable a very efficient backend for experiments with different architectural trade-offs, from the array connectivity and topology to the granularity and complexity of each PE.

This hybrid multiprocessor combines the dynamic data-flow principles of execution with the control-flow of the von Neumann model of execution. The two major ideas utilized by the decoupled model are: vector and macro actors with variable resolution, and asynchronous execution of graph and computation operations. The compiler generates graphs with various-sized actors in order to match the characteristics of the computation. For instance, vector actors are proposed for many aspects of scientific computing while lower resolution (complier-generated collection of scalar actors) or higher resolution (scalar actors) is used for unvectorizable programs. A block-scheduling technique for extracting more parallelism from sequential constructs is incorporated in the decoupled architecture. In addition a graph-level priority-scheduling mechanism is implemented that improves resource utilization and yields higher performance. A graph unit executes all graph operations and a computation unit executes all computation operations. The independence of the two main units of the machine allows the efficient pipelined execution of macro actors with diverse granularity characteristics.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-53065-7_86,springer

This paper describes the development of one such model, its implementation and the design of a data-driven machine to support it. The model exploits a form of parallelism known as OR-parallelism and is particularly suited to database applications, although it would also support general applications. It is envisaged that the proposed machine may be refined into an efficient database engine, which can then be a component of a more powerful and integrated logic programming machine.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF03037380,springer
