10.1109/EI2.2018.8582404,A Data-Driven Architecture Design of Stream Computing for the Dispatch and Control System of the Power Grid,IEEE,Conferences,"Physical distribution and logical unification are the crucial features of the future power grid dispatch system, which requires transmitting, processing and storing massive amounts of information. However, the traditional centralized system cannot meet these requirements. Therefore, this paper introduces the big data distribution stream processing technology, and proposes a stream computing framework suitable for the dispatch and control system of the power grid, including task definition, communication queue management, task assignment, task monitoring and task migration. Aiming at solving the problem of poor system extensibility caused by the high coupling of model data and real-time data in current SCADA system, a data decoupling method based on the separation of the dynamic date and static data is proposed, and the task decomposition of real-time data processing is adopted as a case study of the stream computing framework for the dispatch system. The stream computing framework can continuously process the borderless acquired data, and meet the requirements of real-time data distribution storage and interaction for the wide-area dispatch system of the power system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8582404/,2018 2nd IEEE Conference on Energy Internet and Energy System Integration (EI2),20-22 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.67,A Data-Driven Architecture for Remote Control of Sensors over a Wireless Sensor Network and the Internet,IEEE,Conferences,"This study revealed an applicable architecture in which a data-driven mechanism was designed to bridge a wireless sensor network (WSN) and the Internet. The system was divided into two independent parts. The first part is the data communication between the sensor network and the database. The other part is the data communication between the database and the user interface (UI). These two parts are connected by the database server. Asynchronous interoperation was introduced while exchanging data between these two parts. Users were not allowed to control the sensors through direct connection to the sensors and can only use the Web service to update the sensor profile built in the database. The sensors were triggered to start the action through a data-update event from the database. A sensor profile built in the database collected all sensor information and all user control command. For the information to be centralized and triggered by the database, regardless of whether sensors were measured in a periodic sampling or an event-driven environment, all sensor actions were triggered through a data-update event in the database. For the sake of improving user experience, a Web-based UI was implemented using scalable vector graphics (SVG) and Ajax technologies. All operations by users were conducted through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard method. Therefore, this system can be used via a browser and easily deployed. The proposed architecture is suitable for a healthcare system, a personal body area network, and the Infranet for control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5381871/,"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks",14-16 Dec. 2009,ieeexplore

The proposed research will be the part of the overall research project, which focuses on addressing a problem that many organizations experience that introduce an Enterprise Architecture to support the integration of different services across the enterprise. With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models. Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy. Influence of wireless-specific parameters on QoE prediction was also investigated, and it was discovered that they are suitable for use in Quality of Experience prediction models.The problem is that; organizations do not know where they either have or may encounter weaknesses in their Enterprise Architecture with Data Driven Architecture (DDA). The framework presented is based on concepts from Wireless Networks with Driven Architecture will be designed to support both Transitional Gap Analysis (TGA) and Comparative Gap Analysis (CGA).

10.1109/LRA.2019.2896485,Learning From Humans How to Grasp: A Data-Driven Architecture for Autonomous Grasping With Anthropomorphic Soft Hands,IEEE,Journals,"Soft hands are robotic systems that embed compliant elements in their mechanical design. This enables an effective adaptation with the items and the environment, and ultimately, an increase in their grasping performance. These hands come with clear advantages in terms of ease-to-use and robustness if compared with classic rigid hands, when operated by a human. However, their potential for autonomous grasping is still largely unexplored, due to the lack of suitable control strategies. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose an approach to enable soft hands to autonomously grasp objects, starting from the observations of human strategies. A classifier realized through a deep neural network takes as input the visual information on the object to be grasped, and predicts which action a human would perform to achieve the goal. This information is hence used to select one among a set of human-inspired primitives, which define the evolution of the soft hand posture as a combination of anticipatory action and touch-based reactive grasp. The architecture is completed by the hardware component, which consists of an RGB camera to look at the scene, a 7-DoF manipulator, and a soft hand. The latter is equipped with inertial measurement units at the fingernails for detecting contact with the object. We extensively tested the proposed architecture with 20 objects, achieving a success rate of 81.1% over 111 grasps.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8629968/,IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters,April 2019,ieeexplore

Then, we will describe how the controllers can be used to run ML algorithms to predict the number of users in each base station, and a use case in which these predictions are exploited by a higher-layer application to route vehicular traffic according to network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Here, we present an integrated modeling and analysis framework for researching climate change using NPP as an ecosystem indicator. It's brings together remote sensing, GIS and an ecosystem simulation model without requiring users to have any knowledge of any other specific software. Satellite data driven architecture can play a positive role in understanding the climate change and carbon cycles from regional to global scales. The benefit of the framework is that it provides complete spatial coverage and high temporal resolution, versus plot samples from which it may be difficult to provide an overall assessment for large-scale study. Recent advances in service-oriented architectures are allowing us to share of model results by geospatial services and create distributed applications needed for the collaborative research. Multi-layer approaches allow the framework more flexible and easy to extend. New datasets and models can be integrated for use in the development of new applications. A preliminary system based on the framework was carried out for monitoring the dynamic changes of terrestrial ecosystem NPP in China. State-of-the art processing algorithms was developed based on light-use efficiency model (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model).

10.1109/SAM48682.2020.9104367,Deep Radar Waveform Design for Efficient Automotive Radar Sensing,IEEE,Conferences,"In radar systems, unimodular (or constant-modulus) waveform design plays an important role in achieving better clutter/interference rejection, as well as a more accurate estimation of the target parameters. The design of such sequences has been studied widely in the last few decades, with most design algorithms requiring sophisticated a priori knowledge of environmental parameters which may be difficult to obtain in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model-driven and data-driven architecture that adapts to the ever changing environment and allows for adaptive unimodular waveform design. In particular, the approach lays the groundwork for developing extremely low-cost waveform design and processing frameworks for radar systems deployed in autonomous vehicles. The proposed model-based deep architecture imitates a wellknown unimodular signal design algorithm in its structure, and can quickly infer statistical information from the environment using the observed data. Our numerical experiments portray the advantages of using the proposed method for efficient radar waveform design in time-varying environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104367/,2020 IEEE 11th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM),8-11 June 2020,ieeexplore

Data blocks associated with multiple events flow freely from /spl sim/70 frontend digitization crates. Eight separate readout concentrators funnel these blocks onto optical fiber paths to the Level 3 trigger processor farm. The processor farm is divided into segments, each of which is fed by a segment bridge. Data blocks flow to each bridge in turn, where they are either routed to a Level 3 node (or nodes) in the segment, or passed onto the next segment bridge. Blocks that do not flow to a processor node are returned to the readout concentrator. Thus the system has a built-in mechanism for rate limitation. The Event Tag Generator (ETG) and segment bridges facilitate the event routing decisions in real time. The routing is based on the trigger bits from the hardware trigger. This and the availability of nodes in each segment determine to which node(s) the event is routed.

These quantities are related to underlying symmetries and they provide fundamental knowledge about physical laws, describe the evolution of the system, and enable system reduction. In this work, we formulate a data-driven architecture for discovering conserved quantities based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Interestingly, eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator associated with vanishing eigenvalues correspond to conserved quantities of the underlying system. In this paper, we show that these invariants may be identified with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. We further establish a connection between the Koopman framework, conserved quantities, and the Lie-Poisson bracket. This data-driven method for discovering conserved quantities is demonstrated on the three-dimensional rigid body equations, where we simultaneously discover the total energy and angular momentum and use these intrinsic coordinates to develop a model predictive controller to track a given reference value.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8618963/,2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),17-19 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

The system is composed of 104 VME 9U digital boards (of 8 different types) and it is implemented as a data driven architecture. Each board runs on its own 30 MHz clock. Since the data output from the SVT (few Mbytes/sec) are a small fraction of the input data (200 Mbytes/sec), it is extremely difficult to track possible internal errors by using only the output stream. For this reason several diagnostic tools have been implemented: local error registers, error bits propagated through the data streams and the Spy Buffer system. Data flowing through each input and output stream of every board are continuously copied to memory banks named Spy Buffers which act as built in logic state analyzers hooked continuously to internal data streams. The contents of all buffers can be frozen at any time (e.g. on error detection) to take a snapshot of all data flowing through each SVT board. The Spy Buffers are coordinated at system level by the Spy Control Board.

The DART multiprocessor uses prioritized data-driven scheduling to ensure that multiple hard and soft deadlines are met. A data-driven checkpointing scheme has been developed that ensures that these deadlines are met even in the case of processor failures. The basic approach is to monitor the behavior of each computational thread by means of hardware timers. The results of a thread are released only if the thread completes before its given timeout period expires. Otherwise the partial computation on that processor is discarded and the thread is rescheduled on a different processor. A strategy to statically predict the system performance in the event of multiple processor failures is presented and evaluated.

Furthermore, in order to take better advantage of semantic relationship between seen and unseen classes by word vectors, auto-encoder is introduced to our framework to narrow the semantic gap and improve the recognition accuracy. Moreover, we utilize the ε-greedy based max-pooling technique to select the most relevant visual segment from an instance according to the label.

With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models.

Graph networks provide a generalized form to exploit non-euclidean space data. A graph can be visualized as an aggregation of nodes and edges without having any order. Data-driven architecture tends to follow a fixed neural network trying to find the pattern in feature space. These strategies have successfully been applied to many applications for euclidean space data. Since graph data in a non-euclidean space does not follow any kind of order, these solutions can be applied to exploit the node relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) solve this problem by exploiting the relationships among graph data. Recent developments in computational hardware and optimization allow graph networks possible to learn the complex graph relationships. Graph networks are therefore being actively used to solve many problems including protein interface, classification, and learning representations of fingerprints.

A majority of existing research targets at knowledge acquisition from sentences, where subject-verb-object structures are usually treated as the signals of existence of relations.

Previous works mostly relies on human-compiled assertions and textual patterns in English to address noun phrase-based RE. For Chinese, the corresponding task is non-trivial because Chinese is a highly analytic language with flexible expressions. Additionally, noun phrases tend to be incomplete in grammatical structures, where clear mentions of predicates are often missing.

Users were not allowed to control the sensors through direct connection to the sensors and can only use the Web service to update the sensor profile built in the database. The sensors were triggered to start the action through a data-update event from the database. A sensor profile built in the database collected all sensor information and all user control command. For the information to be centralized and triggered by the database, regardless of whether sensors were measured in a periodic sampling or an event-driven environment, all sensor actions were triggered through a data-update event in the database. For the sake of improving user experience, a Web-based UI was implemented using scalable vector graphics (SVG) and Ajax technologies. All operations by users were conducted through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard method. Therefore, this system can be used via a browser and easily deployed. The proposed architecture is suitable for a healthcare system, a personal body area network, and the Infranet for control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5381871/,"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks",14-16 Dec. 2009,ieeexplore

The proposed research will be the part of the overall research project, which focuses on addressing a problem that many organizations experience that introduce an Enterprise Architecture to support the integration of different services across the enterprise. With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models. Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy. Influence of wireless-specific parameters on QoE prediction was also investigated, and it was discovered that they are suitable for use in Quality of Experience prediction models.The problem is that; organizations do not know where they either have or may encounter weaknesses in their Enterprise Architecture with Data Driven Architecture (DDA).

10.1109/LRA.2019.2896485,Learning From Humans How to Grasp: A Data-Driven Architecture for Autonomous Grasping With Anthropomorphic Soft Hands,IEEE,Journals,"Soft hands are robotic systems that embed compliant elements in their mechanical design. This enables an effective adaptation with the items and the environment, and ultimately, an increase in their grasping performance. These hands come with clear advantages in terms of ease-to-use and robustness if compared with classic rigid hands, when operated by a human. However, their potential for autonomous grasping is still largely unexplored, due to the lack of suitable control strategies. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose an approach to enable soft hands to autonomously grasp objects, starting from the observations of human strategies. A classifier realized through a deep neural network takes as input the visual information on the object to be grasped, and predicts which action a human would perform to achieve the goal. This information is hence used to select one among a set of human-inspired primitives, which define the evolution of the soft hand posture as a combination of anticipatory action and touch-based reactive grasp. The architecture is completed by the hardware component, which consists of an RGB camera to look at the scene, a 7-DoF manipulator, and a soft hand. The latter is equipped with inertial measurement units at the fingernails for detecting contact with the object.

It's brings together remote sensing, GIS and an ecosystem simulation model without requiring users to have any knowledge of any other specific software. Satellite data driven architecture can play a positive role in understanding the climate change and carbon cycles from regional to global scales.

Recent advances in service-oriented architectures are allowing us to share of model results by geospatial services and create distributed applications needed for the collaborative research. Multi-layer approaches allow the framework more flexible and easy to extend. New datasets and models can be integrated for use in the development of new applications.

ILS needs support of various integrated support systems, which have demands for data editing. Nowadays, most of data editing software used in these systems are customized and provide a form-based editing approach, which becomes an obstacle to carry out ILS. This paper brings forward to design a data-driven based universal data editing framework.

Data blocks associated with multiple events flow freely from /spl sim/70 frontend digitization crates. Eight separate readout concentrators funnel these blocks onto optical fiber paths to the Level 3 trigger processor farm. The processor farm is divided into segments, each of which is fed by a segment bridge. Data blocks flow to each bridge in turn, where they are either routed to a Level 3 node (or nodes) in the segment, or passed onto the next segment bridge. Blocks that do not flow to a processor node are returned to the readout concentrator. Thus the system has a built-in mechanism for rate limitation. The Event Tag Generator (ETG) and segment bridges facilitate the event routing decisions in real time. The routing is based on the trigger bits from the hardware trigger. This and the availability of nodes in each segment determine to which node(s) the event is routed. We present operational and performance details of this system, designed for comfortably more than the nominal 1 kHz input; being modular and parallel, it can be easily upgraded.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/949427/,2000 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium.

These quantities are related to underlying symmetries and they provide fundamental knowledge about physical laws, describe the evolution of the system, and enable system reduction. In this work, we formulate a data-driven architecture for discovering conserved quantities based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Interestingly, eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator associated with vanishing eigenvalues correspond to conserved quantities of the underlying system. In this paper, we show that these invariants may be identified with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. We further establish a connection between the Koopman framework, conserved quantities, and the Lie-Poisson bracket. This data-driven method for discovering conserved quantities is demonstrated on the three-dimensional rigid body equations, where we simultaneously discover the total energy and angular momentum and use these intrinsic coordinates to develop a model predictive controller to track a given reference value.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8618963/,2018 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),17-19 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

The SVT has an event rate of 100 kHz and a latency time of 10 /spl mu/s. The system is composed of 104 VME 9U digital boards (of 8 different types) and it is implemented as a data driven architecture. Each board runs on its own 30 MHz clock. Since the data output from the SVT (few Mbytes/sec) are a small fraction of the input data (200 Mbytes/sec), it is extremely difficult to track possible internal errors by using only the output stream. For this reason several diagnostic tools have been implemented: local error registers, error bits propagated through the data streams and the Spy Buffer system. Data flowing through each input and output stream of every board are continuously copied to memory banks named Spy Buffers which act as built in logic state analyzers hooked continuously to internal data streams. The contents of all buffers can be frozen at any time (e.g. on error detection) to take a snapshot of all data flowing through each SVT board. The Spy Buffers are coordinated at system level by the Spy Control Board.

The DART multiprocessor uses prioritized data-driven scheduling to ensure that multiple hard and soft deadlines are met. A data-driven checkpointing scheme has been developed that ensures that these deadlines are met even in the case of processor failures. The basic approach is to monitor the behavior of each computational thread by means of hardware timers. The results of a thread are released only if the thread completes before its given timeout period expires. Otherwise the partial computation on that processor is discarded and the thread is rescheduled on a different processor. A strategy to statically predict the system performance in the event of multiple processor failures is presented and evaluated.

Therefore, we propose a novel joint space model of visual data and semantic information to address zero-shot action recognition problems. Furthermore, in order to take better advantage of semantic relationship between seen and unseen classes by word vectors, auto-encoder is introduced to our framework to narrow the semantic gap and improve the recognition accuracy. Moreover, we utilize the ε-greedy based max-pooling technique to select the most relevant visual segment from an instance according to the label.

With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models. Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy.

Graph networks provide a generalized form to exploit non-euclidean space data. A graph can be visualized as an aggregation of nodes and edges without having any order. Data-driven architecture tends to follow a fixed neural network trying to find the pattern in feature space. These strategies have successfully been applied to many applications for euclidean space data. Since graph data in a non-euclidean space does not follow any kind of order, these solutions can be applied to exploit the node relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) solve this problem by exploiting the relationships among graph data. Recent developments in computational hardware and optimization allow graph networks possible to learn the complex graph relationships. Graph networks are therefore being actively used to solve many problems including protein interface, classification, and learning representations of fingerprints.

For Chinese, the corresponding task is non-trivial because Chinese is a highly analytic language with flexible expressions.

Data driven design and analysis for computational imaging systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Computational Imaging (CI) systems that exploit optical multiplexing and algorithmic demultiplexing have been shown to improve imaging performance in tasks such as motion deblurring, extended depth of field, light field and hyper-spectral imaging. Design and performance analysis of many of these approaches tend to ignore the role of image priors. It is well known that utilizing statistical image priors significantly improves demultiplexing performance. In this paper, we extend the Gaussian Mixture Model as a data-driven image prior (proposed by Mitra et. al [21]) to under-determined linear systems and study compressive CI methods such as light-field and hyper-spectral imaging. Further, we derive a novel algorithm for optimizing multiplexing matrices that simultaneously accounts for (a) sensor noise (b) image priors and (c) CI design constraints. We use our algorithm to design data-optimal multiplexing matrices for a variety of existing CI designs, and we use these matrices to analyze the performance of CI systems as a function of noise level.

Typically, these systems are subject to limitations such as disturbances, systems delays, constraints, uncertainties, underperforming controllers, and unmodeled parameters that do not allow them to achieve the desired performance. In situations where it is not possible to redesign the closed-loop system, it is usual to incorporate a reference governor that instructs the system to follow a modified reference path such that the resultant path is close to the ideal one. Typically, strategies to design the reference governor need to know a model of the system, which can be an unfeasible task. In this paper, we propose a framework based on deep reinforcement learning that can learn a policy to generate a modified reference that improves the system’s performance in a non-invasive and model-free fashion. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present two challenging cases in engineering: a flight control with a pilot model that includes human reaction delays, and a mean-field control problem for a massive number of space-heating devices.

DNNs have been used to estimate a time-frequency (T-F) mask in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Their training is more stable when a simple cost function as mean-squared error (MSE) is utilized comparing to some advanced cost such as objective sound quality assessments. However, such a simple cost function inherits strong assumptions on the statistics of the target and/or noise which is often not satisfied, and the mismatch of assumption results in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose to design the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame (WFBF) is considered as PRFB.

Furthermore, in a human-centric environment, the acquired knowledge must fulfill comprehensibility requirements so as to be shared by human users. In literature, several approaches have been proposed to acquire comprehensible knowledge from data by preserving a number of interpretability constraints, especially for Fuzzy Rule-Based Classifiers (FRBCs). As a general result, accuracy and interpretability emerge as conflicting features, so that a tradeoff is often required. In consequence of this tradeoff, the resulting FRBCs are provided with a knowledge base expressed in natural language but, as a matter of fact, the semantics embedded by the linguistic structures might not be cointensive with the explicit semantics defined in the knowledge base. As an alternative approach, in this paper we propose a technique to design FRBCs from data with the specific aim of maximizing interpretability in the sense of semantic cointension. The most important result of this approach is to control cointension so as to select models that possess knowledge bases that users can understand on the basis of their natural language description. This enables the use of the FRBC in a human-centric environment.

10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9683046,Probabilistically Robust Bayesian Optimization for Data-Driven Design of Arbitrary Controllers with Gaussian Process Emulators,IEEE,Conferences,"A fundamental challenge in control applications stems from the lack of a sufficiently detailed system model that can be used for systematic controller design and tuning under uncertainty. This paper presents a fully data-driven robust controller design approach based on any finite set of closed-loop performance measures. We first present a method for emulating the unknown plant dynamics using a Gaussian process (GP) model learned from input-output data. By running closed-loop simulations under realizations of the GP model using posterior sampling, the impact of system uncertainties on the closed-loop performance measures is quantified. We then formulate the robust controller design problem as a constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) problem defined in terms of the GP-emulated performance measures. To ensure a sufficient number of samples are used to estimate the worst-case performance measures, we derive a bound on the joint probability of violation that is independent of the number or probability distribution of the uncertainties. The advantages of the proposed approach are illustrated on a benchmark control problem, which demonstrates guaranteed probabilistic estimates on the worst-case performance measures are provided at every iteration of CBO.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9683046/,2021 60th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),14-17 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

The algorithms that realise these approaches include not only adaptation of linear parameters in fuzzy systems appearing in the rule consequents, but also incremental learning and evolution of premise parameters appearing in the membership functions (i.e. fuzzy sets) in sample mode together with a rule learning strategy. In this sense the proposed methods are applicable for fast model training tasks in various industrial processes, whenever there is a demand of online system identification in order to apply models representing nonlinear system behaviors to system monitoring, online fault detection or open-loop control. An evaluation of the incremental learning algorithms are included at the end of the paper, where a comparison between conventional batch modelling methods for fuzzy systems and the incremental learning methods demonstrated in this paper is made with respect to model qualities and computation time. This evaluation is based on high dimensional data coming from an industrial measuring process as well as from a known source on the Internet, which underlines the usage of the new method for fast online identification tasks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1548502/,NAFIPS 2005 - 2005 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society,26-28 June 2005,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2818678,A Data-Driven Design for Fault Detection of Wind Turbines Using Random Forests and XGboost,IEEE,Journals,"Wind energy has seen great development during the past decade. However, wind turbine availability and reliability, especially for offshore sites, still need to be improved, which strongly affect the cost of wind energy. Wind turbine operational cost is closely depending on component failure and repair rate, while fault detection and isolation will be very helpful to improve the availability and reliability factors. In this paper, an efficient machine learning method, random forests (RFs) in combination with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), is used to establish the data-driven wind turbine fault detection framework. In the proposed design, RF is used to rank the features by importance, which are either direct sensor signals or constructed variables from prior knowledge. Then, based on the top-ranking features, XGBoost trains the ensemble classifier for each specific fault. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations using the state-of-the-art wind turbine simulator FAST are conducted for three different types of wind turbines in both the below and above rated conditions. It is shown that the proposed approach is robust to various wind turbine models including offshore ones in different working conditions. Besides, the proposed ensemble classifier is able to protect against overfitting, and it achieves better wind turbine fault detection results than the support vector machine method when dealing with multidimensional data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329419/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/JAS.2019.1911543,A hybrid learning method for the data-driven design of linguistic dynamic systems,IEEE,Journals,"In lots of data based prediction or modeling applications, uncertainties and/or noises in the observed data cannot be avoided. In such cases, it is more preferable and reasonable to provide linguistic (fuzzy) predicted results described by fuzzy memberships or fuzzy sets instead of the crisp estimates depicted by numbers. Linguistic dynamic system (LDS) provides a powerful tool for yielding linguistic (fuzzy) results. However, it is still difficult to construct LDS models from observed data. To solve this issue, this paper first presents a simplified LDS whose inputoutput mapping can be determined by closed-form formulas. Then, a hybrid learning method is proposed to construct the data-driven LDS model. The proposed hybrid learning method firstly generates fuzzy rules by the subtractive clustering method, then carries out further optimization of centers of the consequent triangular fuzzy sets in the fuzzy rules, and finally adopts multiobjective optimization algorithm to determine the left and right end-points of the consequent triangular fuzzy sets. The proposed approach is successfully applied to three real-world prediction applications which are: prediction of energy consumption of a building, forecasting of the traffic flow, and prediction of the wind speed. Simulation results show that the uncertainties in the data can be effectively captured by the linguistic (fuzzy) estimates. It can also be extended to some other prediction or modeling problems, in which observed data have high levels of uncertainties.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8741296/,IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica,November 2019,ieeexplore

At the heart of our system is a machine learning-based generative design method to provide users with a set of diverse optimal design alternatives and an interactive design technique to induce users' preference into the design exploration. The generative design method is the structure on two search process, qualitative and quantitative. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, the qualitative search process first builds up a lower-dimensional representation of a given design space, which is then explored using the unsupervised k-means clustering to synthesise a representative set of user-preferred designs. The quantitative search process explores the design space to find an optimal design in terms of performance criterion such as drag coefficient. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of evaluating drag via Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, a surrogate model is developed to predict the drag coefficients. The designs generated after the generative design step are presented to the user at the interactive step, where potential regions of the design space are identified around the user-selected designs. Afterwards, a new design space is generated by removing the non-preferred regions, which helps to focus the computational efforts on the exploration of the user preferred regions of the design space for a design tailored to the user's requirements.

The system is affected by some additive stochastic disturbance and is subject to constraints that need to be appropriately accounted for in the design. By enforcing constraints to be satisfied for almost all disturbance realizations except for a set of probability ε, we can decide to what extent trading robustness for improving performance and also cope with the case of disturbance with unbounded support. Inspired by the existing literature, we propose a method to realize this trade-off, which combines the scenario approach to chance-constrained optimization with robust optimal control of piecewise affine systems.

This approach has been shown to be successful in reducing the metabolic cost and muscular effort of human movements and in assisting impaired subject in daily activities. Yet still very little is known about how to optimise the transmission of forces at the interface between the suit and the human body, with significant implications for comfort, efficiency and safety of the device. This work outlines the design and characterisation of a soft, textile-based exosuit for assistance of flexion/extension of the elbow joint, with emphasis on a data-driven design for optimising the efficiency of the transmission and the distribution of forces at the human-suit interface. Quantifying and understanding how design choices such as the materials used for transmitting power and the structure of the functional components of the suit affect these parameters can help us to improve the ergonomics, safety and effectiveness of such devices. Results obtained by comparing different Bowden cables constructions show that the ones with a linear-strand construction offer the highest efficiency and stiffness, lowest backlash and lowest viscous friction.

The core operations in DONet are very simple: every node periodically exchanges data availability information with a set of partners, and retrieves unavailable data from one or more partners, or supplies available data to partners. We emphasize three salient features of this data-driven design: 1) easy to implement, as it does not have to construct and maintain a complex global structure; 2) efficient, as data forwarding is dynamically determined according to data availability while not restricted by specific directions; and 3) robust and resilient, as the partnerships enable adaptive and quick switching among multi-suppliers. We show through analysis that DONet is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing DONet, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of DONet over the PlanetLab. Our experiments, involving almost all the active PlanetLab nodes, demonstrate that DONet achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions.

In addition, reliability in the automotive industry plays a crucial role for product safety. During fast-paced product development, design for reliability is essential to guarantee product reliability while maintaining short iteration times. This requires detailed knowledge of relevant failure modes, loads and use cases. However, most product and test design is based on assumptions, estimations and experience. Here we show how to leverage field data to design reliability into the product along its whole development cycle. We use field reliability data to derive the reliability allocation which drives the reliability targets for the systems and subsystems. Based on actual user data, we provide design engineers with requirements for relevant use cases. Furthermore, the data helps us to develop user-specific test profiles. Our approach shows how data driven product development can reduce development times and leads to more user centered product designs. Additionally, using field data derived test profiles reveals relevant failure modes during testing and simulation.

ANNs are firstly used as state models in a HMM primitive divider that associates each signal frame with an ANN by minimizing the accumulated prediction error. Then, the neural modelling is realized by training each network on its own frame set. Organizing these two steps in an EM algorithm, precise primitive models are obtained. On the other hand, a data driven systematic method is proposed for the HMM topology inference task. All possible prototypes of a pattern class are firstly merged into several clusters by a tabu search aided clustering algorithm.

Our data-driven design approach uses a corpus of human-labeled edges in order to learn the concept of an edge in an image.

DNNs have been used to estimate a time-frequency (T-F) mask in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Their training is more stable when a simple cost function as mean-squared error (MSE) is utilized comparing to some advanced cost such as objective sound quality assessments. However, such a simple cost function inherits strong assumptions on the statistics of the target and/or noise which is often not satisfied, and the mismatch of assumption results in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose to design the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame (WFBF) is considered as PRFB.

The hand in particular is a complex system that has proven difficult to mimic with current exoskeleton technologies. This paper presents data-driven design parameters to increase the functionality and improve the assistance profile of the ArmAssist-2.0 hand module. Improvements from the previous model include adjustable linkages to fulfill the largest population of users, new joint locations to more accurately represent biomechanics of the hand, and a more impairment-appropriate torque profile to assist in hand opening, adjustable through interchangeable springs. In most passive hand orthoses, assistance forces tend to decrease as the hand and thumb extend, opposite the needs of a typical patient hand. This project utilizes a variable spring moment arm about the revolute axes to match common patient impairment more accurately. The revised assistance profile for the hand maintains a nearly linear relationship. Results conclude that the final assembled device fits comfortably in the hand with noticeable improvements in joint locations, adjustability, and the force profile for the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.

Recent work has introduced data-driven design methods that leverage graph neural network (GNN) to efficiently parametrize the power control policy mapping channel state information (CSI) to the power vector. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN), defines a non-linear graph convolutional architecture whose spatial weights are tied to the channel coefficients, enabling a direct adaption to channel conditions. This paper studies the higher-level problem of enabling fast adaption of the power control policy to time-varying topologies. To this end, we apply first-order meta-learning on data from multiple topologies with the aim of optimizing for a few-shot adaptation to new network configurations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9593131/,2021 IEEE 22nd International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC),27-30 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

We assume that the structure of a nonlinear system addressed here is known and the parameters are unknown. In addition, a nonlinear system addressed here is assumed to be with the property that the input time series and the output time series has one to one relation. For this type of nonlinear system, the internal model controller that is represented by the parameters of a model is introduced. Then, fictitious reference iterative tuning, which is one of the data-driven controller tuning methods based on the direct use of one-shot experimental data, is extended for tuning the parameterized internal model controllers. It is also shown that the cost function to be minimized in fictitious reference iterative tuning is related to both of the achievement of the desired tracking and the attainment of a model. That is, the proposed method in this paper enables us to simultaneously obtain a model and a controller by applying only one-shot experimental data to the parameterized internal model controller.

The estimation relies on a data-driven design of a spatial filter, referred to as the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD)-based multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF). In non-stationary or low-SNR conditions, this GEVD-based MWF has been demonstrated to be more robust than the original MWF due to an inherent GEVD-based low-rank approximation of the sensor signal correlation matrix. In a centralized realization where a fusion center has access to all the nodes' sensor signal observations, the network-wide sensor signal correlation matrix and its low-rank approximation can be directly estimated from the sensor signals. However, in this paper we aim to avoid centralizing the sensor signal observations, in which case this network-wide correlation matrix cannot be estimated. We introduce a distributed algorithm which is able to significantly compress the broadcast signals while still converging to the centralized GEVD-based MWF as if each node would have access to all sensor signal observations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7178489/,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",19-24 April 2015,ieeexplore

One issue that has not been considered in such applications is the ability to deal with key performance indicators (KPIs) that are only sporadically measured and with significant time delay. Therefore, in this paper, the data-driven design of diagnostic-observer-based process monitoring schemes is extended to include the ability to detect changes given infrequently measured KPIs. The extended diagnostic observer is shown to be stable and hence able to converge to the true value. The proposed method is tested using both Monte Carlo simulations and the Tennessee-Eastman problem. It is shown that although time delay and sampling time increase the detection delay, the overall effect can be mitigated by using a soft sensor. Furthermore, it is shown that the results are not strongly dependent on the sampling time, but do depend on the time delay.

By using a logarithmic transform, this class of network maps to a family of subtraction-free ratios of generalized posynomials (GPOS), which we also show to be universal approximators of positive functions over log-convex, compact subsets of the positive orthant. The main advantage of difference-LSE networks with respect to classical feedforward neural networks is that, after a standard training phase, they provide surrogate models for a design that possesses a specific difference-of-convex-functions form, which makes them optimizable via relatively efficient numerical methods. In particular, by adapting an existing difference-of-convex algorithm to these models, we obtain an algorithm for performing an effective optimization-based design.

While manually designed subword units generalize well, they may not be the optimal units of classification for the specific task or environment for which an LVCSR system is trained. Moreover, when human expertise is not available, it may not be possible to design good subword units manually. There is clearly a need for data-driven design of these LVCSR components.

In addition, the parameter estimation algorithm is developed for the proposed CFDL-ET-MFAC to identify the CFDL model in real time for improving the robustness to the uncertainties. Meanwhile, both a partial form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC and a full form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC are proposed to further improve the control performance by using additional parameters to capture the more complicated behavior of complex nonlinear systems. The proposed ET-MFAC methods only rely on the linear data models directly obtained from data without using any other mechanistic model information. The validity of the three ET-MFAC methods is confirmed through both theoretical analysis and simulation studies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8754709/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",June 2021,ieeexplore

To this end, the study proposed a data-driven support and decision model (DSDM) that uses a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) to analyze data collected from different writing centers and coaching programs who responded to an online survey that comprised of both quantitative and qualitative items. Quantitatively, we applied a Linear and Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to investigate the critical factors that motivate the users in seeking educational support services. And, qualitatively apply the Text mining technique to analyze the opinions given by the participants in order to establish its level of impact towards the several services offered by the coaching programs. Theoretically, the proposed research model is grounded on integration of a data-structure approach that builds on the descriptive decision theory; which studies the rationality of the decisions that users are disposed to make by means of the statistical method and textual data quantification. In turn, the method allowed us to capture the influential factors and state-of-the-art in faculties-students development and coaching programs, and to provide solutions to the ever-increasing need to improve educational supporting services and quality in a competitive and rapidly changing educational environment or market that have not been done before. Although there may be a considerable variation between the different categories of educational services offered by the coaching centers.

In this paper, a data-driven design method is proposed for the DOB-based control system using iteration feedback tuning (IFT) based on the first-order-plus-time-delay models. It is well known that the conventional data-based design methods cannot provide an explicit tradeoff between robustness and performance. Here, our goal is to develop a method to design the data-driven DOB-based control system satisfying a given robustness index. To this end, first, the tuning rules of the controller and the Q-filter in terms of the nominal process model are analytically determined for a given robustness index. Second, an optimization problem, solved by IFT algorithm, is established to find the optimal parameters of the nominal model. The merits of the proposed method are that: 1) the number of parameters needing to be tuned is reduced, since only the parameters of the nominal model are optimized and 2) the system satisfies the explicit robustness index if the parameters are optimal. Moreover, the selection of the robustness index, the output performance of the system, and the performance of the iteration algorithm are addressed.

The proposed approach integrates well into conventional synchronous design flows because they are based on Verilog and SystemVerilog specifications, and generate register-transfer level models suitable for functional simulation and logic synthesis using existing computer-aided design tools.

In the proposed classification system, trajectories are segmented at points of change in curvature, and the subtrajectories are represented by their principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients. We first present a framework to robustly estimate the multivariate probability density function based on PCA coefficients of the subtrajectories using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We show that GMM-based modeling alone cannot capture the temporal relations and ordering between underlying entities. To address this issue, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) with a data-driven design in terms of number of states and topology (e.g., left-right versus ergodic).

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely applied in the field. However, the classical PSO suffers from premature convergence, and it is trapped easily into local optima, which will significantly affect the model accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a new T-S fuzzy system parameters searching strategy called OptiFel with a heterogeneous multiswarm PSO (MsPSO) to enhance the searching performance. MsPSO groups the whole population into multiple cooperative subswarms, which perform different search behaviors for the potential solutions. We have found that the multiple subswarms strategy proposed in this paper is greatly helpful for finding the optimal parameters suitable for the subspaces of the T-S fuzzy model. Our theoretical proof has also demonstrated that the cooperation among the subswarms can maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation to ensure the particles converge to stable points. Experimental results show that MsPSO performs significantly better than traditional PSO algorithms on six benchmark functions. With the improved MsPSO, OptiFel can generate a good fuzzy system model with high accuracy and strong generalization ability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6583326/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,Aug. 2014,ieeexplore

Additionally, effective monitoring of large urban components, such as civil infrastructure, often involves multiple sensor devices and invasive sensor systems. In these situations, the design of measurement systems is an important task. Usually, this task is carried out by engineers using only qualitative rules of thumb and experience.

10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683861,Data-driven Design of Perfect Reconstruction Filterbank for DNN-based Sound Source Enhancement,IEEE,Conferences,"We propose a data-driven design method of perfect-reconstruction filterbank (PRFB) for sound-source enhancement (SSE) based on deep neural network (DNN). DNNs have been used to estimate a time-frequency (T-F) mask in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Their training is more stable when a simple cost function as mean-squared error (MSE) is utilized comparing to some advanced cost such as objective sound quality assessments. However, such a simple cost function inherits strong assumptions on the statistics of the target and/or noise which is often not satisfied, and the mismatch of assumption results in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose to design the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame (WFBF) is considered as PRFB. The frequency characteristic of learned WFBF was in between STFT and the wavelet transform, and its effectiveness was confirmed by comparison with a standard STFT-based DNN whose input feature is compressed into the mel scale.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8683861/,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",12-17 May 2019,ieeexplore

Furthermore, in a human-centric environment, the acquired knowledge must fulfill comprehensibility requirements so as to be shared by human users. In literature, several approaches have been proposed to acquire comprehensible knowledge from data by preserving a number of interpretability constraints, especially for Fuzzy Rule-Based Classifiers (FRBCs). As a general result, accuracy and interpretability emerge as conflicting features, so that a tradeoff is often required. In consequence of this tradeoff, the resulting FRBCs are provided with a knowledge base expressed in natural language but, as a matter of fact, the semantics embedded by the linguistic structures might not be cointensive with the explicit semantics defined in the knowledge base. As an alternative approach, in this paper we propose a technique to design FRBCs from data with the specific aim of maximizing interpretability in the sense of semantic cointension. The most important result of this approach is to control cointension so as to select models that possess knowledge bases that users can understand on the basis of their natural language description. This enables the use of the FRBC in a human-centric environment.

We then formulate the robust controller design problem as a constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) problem defined in terms of the GP-emulated performance measures. To ensure a sufficient number of samples are used to estimate the worst-case performance measures, we derive a bound on the joint probability of violation that is independent of the number or probability distribution of the uncertainties.

However, wind turbine availability and reliability, especially for offshore sites, still need to be improved, which strongly affect the cost of wind energy. Wind turbine operational cost is closely depending on component failure and repair rate, while fault detection and isolation will be very helpful to improve the availability and reliability factors. In this paper, an efficient machine learning method, random forests (RFs) in combination with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), is used to establish the data-driven wind turbine fault detection framework. In the proposed design, RF is used to rank the features by importance, which are either direct sensor signals or constructed variables from prior knowledge. Then, based on the top-ranking features, XGBoost trains the ensemble classifier for each specific fault. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations using the state-of-the-art wind turbine simulator FAST are conducted for three different types of wind turbines in both the below and above rated conditions.

In such cases, it is more preferable and reasonable to provide linguistic (fuzzy) predicted results described by fuzzy memberships or fuzzy sets instead of the crisp estimates depicted by numbers. Linguistic dynamic system (LDS) provides a powerful tool for yielding linguistic (fuzzy) results. However, it is still difficult to construct LDS models from observed data. To solve this issue, this paper first presents a simplified LDS whose inputoutput mapping can be determined by closed-form formulas. Then, a hybrid learning method is proposed to construct the data-driven LDS model. The proposed hybrid learning method firstly generates fuzzy rules by the subtractive clustering method, then carries out further optimization of centers of the consequent triangular fuzzy sets in the fuzzy rules, and finally adopts multiobjective optimization algorithm to determine the left and right end-points of the consequent triangular fuzzy sets. The proposed approach is successfully applied to three real-world prediction applications which are: prediction of energy consumption of a building, forecasting of the traffic flow, and prediction of the wind speed.

At the heart of our system is a machine learning-based generative design method to provide users with a set of diverse optimal design alternatives and an interactive design technique to induce users' preference into the design exploration. The generative design method is the structure on two search process, qualitative and quantitative. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, the qualitative search process first builds up a lower-dimensional representation of a given design space, which is then explored using the unsupervised k-means clustering to synthesise a representative set of user-preferred designs. The quantitative search process explores the design space to find an optimal design in terms of performance criterion such as drag coefficient. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of evaluating drag via Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, a surrogate model is developed to predict the drag coefficients. The designs generated after the generative design step are presented to the user at the interactive step, where potential regions of the design space are identified around the user-selected designs. Afterwards, a new design space is generated by removing the non-preferred regions, which helps to focus the computational efforts on the exploration of the user preferred regions of the design space for a design tailored to the user's requirements.

Different from the standard data-driven approaches, the proposed scheme is adopted for the dynamic systems due to the superior tracking ability of output observer. Additionally, by introducing an extra design freedom and the estimation of measured value, it can also be used for the case that the key variable is not on-line measurable.

The objective of the control problem is to make the closed-loop system to match the behavior of an assigned reference model as close as possible. As is well known, the presence of one of more non-minimum phase zeros in the plant transfer function makes the direct data-driven design procedure significantly harder since, no matter what is the considered approach among the ones proposed in the literature, the designed controller commonly leads to an unstable closed-loop system due to unstable pole-zero cancellations. In this paper we propose a new approach for performing the design of direct data-driven controller when the unknown plant may or may not have non-minimum phase zeros.

Affective states often influence progress on learning tasks, resulting in positive or negative cycles of affect that impact learning outcomes.

In order to advance understanding of learning-centered affect, this paper reports on a study to analyze a video corpus of computer-mediated human tutoring using an automated facial expression recognition tool that detects fine-grained facial movements. The results reveal three significant relationships between facial expression, frustration, and learning: (1) Action Unit 2 (outer brow raise) was negatively correlated with learning gain, (2) Action Unit 4 (brow lowering) was positively correlated with frustration, and (3) Action Unit 14 (mouth dimpling) was positively correlated with both frustration and learning gain.

This approach has been shown to be successful in reducing the metabolic cost and muscular effort of human movements and in assisting impaired subject in daily activities. Yet still very little is known about how to optimise the transmission of forces at the interface between the suit and the human body, with significant implications for comfort, efficiency and safety of the device. This work outlines the design and characterisation of a soft, textile-based exosuit for assistance of flexion/extension of the elbow joint, with emphasis on a data-driven design for optimising the efficiency of the transmission and the distribution of forces at the human-suit interface. Quantifying and understanding how design choices such as the materials used for transmitting power and the structure of the functional components of the suit affect these parameters can help us to improve the ergonomics, safety and effectiveness of such devices. Results obtained by comparing different Bowden cables constructions show that the ones with a linear-strand construction offer the highest efficiency and stiffness, lowest backlash and lowest viscous friction. Combining semi-rigid components with fabric at the anchor points of the suit allows for a more homogeneous distribution of force at the human-suit interface, avoiding peaks of pressure that can disrupt subcutaneous blood flow and cause tissue damage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8383868/,2017 International Symposium on Wearable Robotics and Rehabilitation (WeRob),5-8 Nov. 2017,ieeexplore

The core operations in DONet are very simple: every node periodically exchanges data availability information with a set of partners, and retrieves unavailable data from one or more partners, or supplies available data to partners. We emphasize three salient features of this data-driven design: 1) easy to implement, as it does not have to construct and maintain a complex global structure; 2) efficient, as data forwarding is dynamically determined according to data availability while not restricted by specific directions; and 3) robust and resilient, as the partnerships enable adaptive and quick switching among multi-suppliers. We show through analysis that DONet is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing DONet, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of DONet over the PlanetLab. Our experiments, involving almost all the active PlanetLab nodes, demonstrate that DONet achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions. Moreover, its control overhead and transmission delay are both kept at low levels.

Specifically, the design of residual generation is then formulated as to solve a convex optimization problem by combining ideas from the over-parameterization and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs), and thus provides residual signals directly from process data. To solve the multiply-outputs (MOs) problem, a modified approach is proposed by means of the so-called mixed block Hankel matrices. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a parity space are established and proved.

These control design methods bypass the system identification step and directly exploit collected data to construct the controller. In this paper, we investigate the application of data-driven methods to the control of electric motor drives, and specifically to the design of current controllers for three-phase synchronous permanent magnet motor drives. Two of the most promising data-driven algorithms are presented, namely the Subspace Predictive Control algorithm and the Data-Enabled Predictive Control algorithm. The theory behind these techniques is first reviewed in the optimization-based control framework. Standard algorithms are slightly modified to fulfill the requirements of the specific application, and then simulated in the MATLAB Simulink environment. Some key aspects of real-time implementation are studied, providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of the applicability of these algorithms.

The hand in particular is a complex system that has proven difficult to mimic with current exoskeleton technologies. This paper presents data-driven design parameters to increase the functionality and improve the assistance profile of the ArmAssist-2.0 hand module. Improvements from the previous model include adjustable linkages to fulfill the largest population of users, new joint locations to more accurately represent biomechanics of the hand, and a more impairment-appropriate torque profile to assist in hand opening, adjustable through interchangeable springs. In most passive hand orthoses, assistance forces tend to decrease as the hand and thumb extend, opposite the needs of a typical patient hand. This project utilizes a variable spring moment arm about the revolute axes to match common patient impairment more accurately. The revised assistance profile for the hand maintains a nearly linear relationship. Results conclude that the final assembled device fits comfortably in the hand with noticeable improvements in joint locations, adjustability, and the force profile for the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint.

The estimation relies on a data-driven design of a spatial filter, referred to as the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD)-based multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF). In non-stationary or low-SNR conditions, this GEVD-based MWF has been demonstrated to be more robust than the original MWF due to an inherent GEVD-based low-rank approximation of the sensor signal correlation matrix. In a centralized realization where a fusion center has access to all the nodes' sensor signal observations, the network-wide sensor signal correlation matrix and its low-rank approximation can be directly estimated from the sensor signals. However, in this paper we aim to avoid centralizing the sensor signal observations, in which case this network-wide correlation matrix cannot be estimated. We introduce a distributed algorithm which is able to significantly compress the broadcast signals while still converging to the centralized GEVD-based MWF as if each node would have access to all sensor signal observations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7178489/,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",19-24 April 2015,ieeexplore

One issue that has not been considered in such applications is the ability to deal with key performance indicators (KPIs) that are only sporadically measured and with significant time delay. Therefore, in this paper, the data-driven design of diagnostic-observer-based process monitoring schemes is extended to include the ability to detect changes given infrequently measured KPIs. The extended diagnostic observer is shown to be stable and hence able to converge to the true value. The proposed method is tested using both Monte Carlo simulations and the Tennessee-Eastman problem. It is shown that although time delay and sampling time increase the detection delay, the overall effect can be mitigated by using a soft sensor. Furthermore, it is shown that the results are not strongly dependent on the sampling time, but do depend on the time delay.

10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2975051,A Universal Approximation Result for Difference of Log-Sum-Exp Neural Networks,IEEE,Journals,"We show that a neural network whose output is obtained as the difference of the outputs of two feedforward networks with exponential activation function in the hidden layer and logarithmic activation function in the output node, referred to as log-sum-exp (LSE) network, is a smooth universal approximator of continuous functions over convex, compact sets. By using a logarithmic transform, this class of network maps to a family of subtraction-free ratios of generalized posynomials (GPOS), which we also show to be universal approximators of positive functions over log-convex, compact subsets of the positive orthant. The main advantage of difference-LSE networks with respect to classical feedforward neural networks is that, after a standard training phase, they provide surrogate models for a design that possesses a specific difference-of-convex-functions form, which makes them optimizable via relatively efficient numerical methods. In particular, by adapting an existing difference-of-convex algorithm to these models, we obtain an algorithm for performing an effective optimization-based design. We illustrate the proposed approach by applying it to the data-driven design of a diet for a patient with type-2 diabetes and to a nonconvex optimization problem.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9032340/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/89.985546,Automatic generation of subword units for speech recognition systems,IEEE,Journals,"Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems traditionally represent words in terms of smaller subword units. Both during training and during recognition, they require a mapping table, called the dictionary, which maps words into sequences of these subword units. The performance of the LVCSR system depends critically on the definition of the subword units and the accuracy of the dictionary. In current LVCSR systems, both these components are manually designed. While manually designed subword units generalize well, they may not be the optimal units of classification for the specific task or environment for which an LVCSR system is trained. Moreover, when human expertise is not available, it may not be possible to design good subword units manually. There is clearly a need for data-driven design of these LVCSR components. In this paper, we present a complete probabilistic formulation for the automatic design of subword units and dictionary, given only the acoustic data and their transcriptions.

The task-oriented design minimizes the human effort and guarantees the perfect task tracking in the outer-loop, while the plant-oriented achieves the desired impedance from the human to the robot manipulator end-effector in the inner-loop. Data-driven reinforcement learning techniques are used for performance optimization in the outer-loop to assign the optimal impedance parameters.

Bridging a massive amount of geo-distributed broadcasters and their fellow viewers, such representatives as Twitch.tv, Youtube Gaming, and Inke.tv, have greatly changed the generation and distribution landscape of streaming content. They also enable rich online interactions among the crowd, and strive to offer personalized Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for individual viewers. Given the ultra-large scale and the dynamics of the crowd, personalizing QoE however is much more challenging than in early generation streaming services. The rich interactions among the broadcasters, viewers, and the network system, on the other hand, also offer invaluable data that could be utilized towards informed management. This paper presents DeepCast, an edge-assisted crowdcast framework that explores the sheer amount of viewing data towards intelligent decisions for personalized QoE demands. DeepCast seamlessly integrates cloud, CDN, and edge servers for crowdcast content distribution, and advocates a data-driven design that extracts the hidden information from the complex interactions among the system components. Through deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it automatically identifies the most suitable strategies for viewer assignment and transcoding at edges. We collect multiple real-world datasets and evaluate the performance of DeepCast with trace-driven experiments.

We find that, while the first and second statistical moments exhibit a very similar behavior, skewness and kurtosis are substantially different and must be taken into account in order to provide an accurate prediction of the switching performance. In fact, a reasonable fit of the probability density function (PDF) of the switching time is given by a Pearson Type IV PDF.

This brief proposes a data-driven design approach for an FFT ASIC solution, which exploits the limited range of data encountered by these embedded systems. The optimizations proposed in this brief use the simple concept of hashing and lookup table to effectively reduce the number of arithmetic operations required to perform the FFT of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. By reducing the dynamic power consumption and overall energy footprint of FFT computation, the proposed design aims to achieve longer battery life for a cardiac pacemaker. The design is synthesized using a 90-nm standard cell library, and gate level switching activity is simulated to obtain accurate power consumption results.

In our proposed method, single-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (S-VRFT), where the holding interval is the same as the sampling interval, is extended to the dual-rate virtual reference feedback tuning (D-VRFT) system. In D-VRFT, a controller is decided using a set of input/output data used in S-VRFT, and it is easy to extend S-VRFT to D-VRFT and implement D-VRFT. In this study, intersample oscillations caused in such a dual-rate control system is prevented because a weighting filter is introduced for penalizing the control input deviation between the sampling instants. The filter is designed as an integrator for weighting the low-frequency domain.

By introducing a compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) scheme, a linear data model of the nonlinear nonaffine system is derived. Then, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed to offline identify the linear data model. On the basis of the identified linear data model, a CFDL-based event-triggered model-free adaptive control (CFDL-ET-MFAC) is developed by designing an event-triggering condition to guarantee the Lyapunov stability. The control action is active only when the event-triggering condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the input signal remains the same as that at the previous triggering instant. In addition, the parameter estimation algorithm is developed for the proposed CFDL-ET-MFAC to identify the CFDL model in real time for improving the robustness to the uncertainties. Meanwhile, both a partial form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC and a full form dynamic linearization-based event-triggered MFAC are proposed to further improve the control performance by using additional parameters to capture the more complicated behavior of complex nonlinear systems.

To this end, the study proposed a data-driven support and decision model (DSDM) that uses a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative) to analyze data collected from different writing centers and coaching programs who responded to an online survey that comprised of both quantitative and qualitative items. Quantitatively, we applied a Linear and Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to investigate the critical factors that motivate the users in seeking educational support services. And, qualitatively apply the Text mining technique to analyze the opinions given by the participants in order to establish its level of impact towards the several services offered by the coaching programs.

Second, an optimization problem, solved by IFT algorithm, is established to find the optimal parameters of the nominal model. The merits of the proposed method are that: 1) the number of parameters needing to be tuned is reduced, since only the parameters of the nominal model are optimized and 2) the system satisfies the explicit robustness index if the parameters are optimal.

In the proposed classification system, trajectories are segmented at points of change in curvature, and the subtrajectories are represented by their principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients. We first present a framework to robustly estimate the multivariate probability density function based on PCA coefficients of the subtrajectories using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We show that GMM-based modeling alone cannot capture the temporal relations and ordering between underlying entities. To address this issue, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) with a data-driven design in terms of number of states and topology (e.g., left-right versus ergodic).

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is widely applied in the field. However, the classical PSO suffers from premature convergence, and it is trapped easily into local optima, which will significantly affect the model accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a new T-S fuzzy system parameters searching strategy called OptiFel with a heterogeneous multiswarm PSO (MsPSO) to enhance the searching performance. MsPSO groups the whole population into multiple cooperative subswarms, which perform different search behaviors for the potential solutions. We have found that the multiple subswarms strategy proposed in this paper is greatly helpful for finding the optimal parameters suitable for the subspaces of the T-S fuzzy model. Our theoretical proof has also demonstrated that the cooperation among the subswarms can maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation to ensure the particles converge to stable points. Experimental results show that MsPSO performs significantly better than traditional PSO algorithms on six benchmark functions.
