today's computing environments. This makes it difficult for them to meet the
scalability, heterogeneity, availability, and security challenges in current
cloud and parallel computing environments. To address these problems, we
propose a radically new OS design based on data-centric architecture: all
operating system state should be represented uniformly as database tables, and
operations on this state should be made via queries from otherwise stateless
tasks. This design makes it easy to scale and evolve the OS without
whole-system refactoring, inspect and debug system state, upgrade components
without downtime, manage decisions using machine learning, and implement
sophisticated security features. We discuss how a database OS (DBOS) can
improve the programmability and performance of many of today's most important
applications and propose a plan for the development of a DBOS proof of concept.",arxiv

devices, this paper explores the challenges for data centric design
ethnography. Often purchased to perform specific tasks, IoT devices exist in a
complex ecosystem. This paper describes a study that used a variety of methods
to capture the interactions an IoT device engaged in when it was first setup.
The complexity of the study that is explored through the annotated
documentation across video and router activity, presents the ethnographic
challenges that designers face in an age of connected things.",arxiv

to explosion of data in every field of operations. Working with the enormous
volume of data (or Big Data, as it is popularly known as) for extraction of
useful information to support decision making is one of the sources of
competitive advantage for organizations today. Enterprises are leveraging the
power of analytics in formulating business strategy in every facet of their
operations to mitigate business risk. Volatile global market scenario has
compelled the organizations to redefine their supply chain management (SCM). In
this paper, we have delineated the relevance of Big Data and its importance in
managing end to end supply chains for achieving business excellence. A Big
Data-centric architecture for SCM has been proposed that exploits the current
state of the art technology of data management, analytics and visualization.
The security and privacy requirements of a Big Data system have also been
highlighted and several mechanisms have been discussed to implement these
features in a real world Big Data system deployment in the context of SCM. Some
future scope of work has also been pointed out. Keyword: Big Data, Analytics,

with the recently commissioned OmegaCAM wide-field imager on the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST). A suite of data products will be delivered to the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) and the community by the KiDS survey team. Spread
over Europe, the KiDS team uses Astro-WISE to collaborate efficiently and pool
hardware resources. In Astro-WISE the team shares, calibrates and archives all
survey data. The data-centric architectural design realizes a dynamic 'live
archive' in which new KiDS survey products of improved quality can be shared
with the team and eventually the full astronomical community in a flexible and
controllable manner.",arxiv
