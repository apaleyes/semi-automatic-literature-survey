Chapter ConferencePaper,doi:10.1007/978-981-15-5859-7_51,Preliminary Study and Implementation of Chiang Mai Tourism Platform Based on DOSA,Proceedings of Fifth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology,10.1007/978-981-15-5859-7_51,Springer,2021-01-01,2020-10-01,"To cope with data complication systematically, a tourism platform is proposed through a newly-defined concept named Data Oriented Security Architecture or DOSA. The framework of DOSA shifts an attention from “Application” in a conventional method to “Data”. The main idea is to neutralize the numerously different sources of data into single entity called Data Register Center and strengthen the security of data by utilizing the public- and private-key encryption. Thus it could be simply adaptable to the varieties of applications and easily extensible to sustainable development. The advantages of DOSA include (1) maintainability of data ownership, (2) improvement in security and privacy, and (3) reduction in storage that, as a result, are suitable to modern application development. The application prototype is implemented in web application and piloted by a set of tourist destination in Chiang Mai. This work contains the implementation from Data Register Center in DOSA through the Tourism Service Platform. Although the sample does not include all features of the DOSA, the results are comprehensive and ready for the future extension and improvement.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-5859-7_51,springer

However, in many corporations, this important process is fragmented and is undertaken without a farsighted plan to take advantage of an invaluable resource: data. This can be due to a variety of reasons, for example, lack of funding, poor business vision, inappropriate consulting or deployment. Digital transformation is a considerable investment since it will determine the system’s ability to grow and adapt to the company’s changing requirements. To achieve that end, the architecture must be flexible both in development and deployment and must also be able to harness the ever-increasing data of the corporation. Among the widely used information system architectures being used in the world, Micro-service is a standout with many advantages. The adaptation of this architecture to work with Big Data, as well as to tackle different aspects of a data system such as load-balancing, file handling and storage, etc. is a very practical area of research. This paper presents such an enterprise integration solution for a mega-corporation client in Vietnam, the An Pha Petrol Group Joint Stock Company, including the architecture and technologies used to build a comprehensive system that brings novel experiences to its 2,000 internal users. It consists of building the information infrastructure and system, super applications for both desktop and mobile devices to enhance the work performance and quality. The approaches and results of this paper are applicable to similar large enterprise solutions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-88207-5_17,springer
Chapter,doi:10.1007/978-3-319-44881-7_1,Performance Modeling of Big Data-Oriented Architectures,Resource Management for Big Data Platforms,10.1007/978-3-319-44881-7_1,Springer,2016-01-01,2016-10-28,"Big Data applications provide new, disruptive tools to advance our knowledge about the mechanisms that characterize complex aspects of reality. Be it a high energy physics experiment or an analysis of social networks data, the strength of the approach is the availability of a huge richness of data; but, at the same time, it is also the main challenge, as this abundance of information must be processed at a bearable cost per information unit and requires higher scale systems to provide enough computing power. This is only possible if the Big Data platform is properly managed and exploited according to the needs of the applications, and a fundamental premise is the capability for a proper performance evaluation of the platform. In this chapter, we provide a glance over the main aspects of performance evaluation for Big Data architectures, together with some examples of model-based evaluation, in order to show how it is possible to characterize big scale architectures to support their correct management, and suggest a methodological coarse grain solution to exploit different conceptual and technical tools to integrate a flexible, model-based, performance analysis supported approach to Big Data systems design, capable of scaling up easily in the core evaluation stage means of Markovian agents.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-44881-7_1,springer
