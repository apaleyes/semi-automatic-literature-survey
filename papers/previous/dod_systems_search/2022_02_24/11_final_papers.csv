Each task is mapped to a highly optimized hardware unit by classifying the video processing tasks into three levels. On the function level, a data driven architecture is adopted to make each processing unit operate once the processing data and buffer are available. Therefore the high computing efficiency of each unit is exploited, hardware is saved, and the computing capability is maximized compared with conventional pipeline decoder. On the system level, a decentralized control scheme is designed to provide high efficient communication between all the processing units to yield the best overall performance. Moreover it features simple control logic and minimum size of the connecting buffers."

The authors have been studying and developing a super-integrated data-driven processor to be applied to the TINA kTN nodes and network interfaces in CUE (Coordinating Users' requirements and Engineering constraints) project. Since the processor is primarily designed to be a scalable VLSI component, it is easily interconnected to form a super-integrated chip and multi-chip system for achieving the performance and reliability demanded in a TINA environment. We first examine the requirements for kTN. A stream-oriented data-driven architecture is then proposed with special emphasis on effective multiprocessing capability with overload tolerance. After that, we demonstrate that autonomous load balancing among super-integrated data-driven processors without adding any runtime overhead to achieve effective and reliable multiprocessing is possible by utilizing the overload tolerance of the processor. Finally, this paper shows preliminary performance estimations of the super-integrated data-driven processor being developed to perform efficient multiprocessing in protocol handling such as TCP/IP."

Whilst fog computing is increasingly recognized as the key paradigm at the foundation of Consumer and Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), most of the initiatives on fog computing focus on extending cloud infrastructure. As a consequence, these infrastructure fall short in addressing heterogeneity and resource constraints characteristics of fog computing environments. In this paper, we (1) explain the requirements of fog computing infrastructure and how they extend well beyond those traditionally addressed by Cloud Computing infrastructures; (2) introduce fogØ5, a fog Infrastructure that unifies computing, networking and storage fabrics end-to-end, while addressing the challenges imposed by resource heterogeneity, (3) explain the novel architectural approach adopted by fogØ5 to have a server-less data-centric architecture that is scalable, secure, and highly resilient to failures, (4) demonstrate the use of fogØ5 in some real-world use cases and (5) conclude and reports on future works."

Thales recently contributed this knowledge and experience in a joint submission regarding the OMG's Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-time systems. The SPLICE architecture is characterized by autonomous applications with minimal dependencies where function and interaction are clearly separated and SPLICE-agents act as real-time information brokers.

The SVT has an event rate of 100 kHz and a latency time of 10 /spl mu/s. The system is composed of 104 VME 9U digital boards (of 8 different types) and it is implemented as a data driven architecture. Each board runs on its own 30 MHz clock. Since the data output from the SVT (few Mbytes/sec) are a small fraction of the input data (200 Mbytes/sec), it is extremely difficult to track possible internal errors by using only the output stream. For this reason several diagnostic tools have been implemented: local error registers, error bits propagated through the data streams and the Spy Buffer system. Data flowing through each input and output stream of every board are continuously copied to memory banks named Spy Buffers which act as built in logic state analyzers hooked continuously to internal data streams. The contents of all buffers can be frozen at any time (e.g. on error detection) to take a snapshot of all data flowing through each SVT board. The Spy Buffers are coordinated at system level by the Spy Control Board. The architecture, design and implementation of this system are described."

However, in many corporations, this important process is fragmented and is undertaken without a farsighted plan to take advantage of an invaluable resource: data. This can be due to a variety of reasons, for example, lack of funding, poor business vision, inappropriate consulting or deployment. Digital transformation is a considerable investment since it will determine the system’s ability to grow and adapt to the company’s changing requirements. To achieve that end, the architecture must be flexible both in development and deployment and must also be able to harness the ever-increasing data of the corporation. Among the widely used information system architectures being used in the world, Micro-service is a standout with many advantages. The adaptation of this architecture to work with Big Data, as well as to tackle different aspects of a data system such as load-balancing, file handling and storage, etc. is a very practical area of research. This paper presents such an enterprise integration solution for a mega-corporation client in Vietnam, the An Pha Petrol Group Joint Stock Company, including the architecture and technologies used to build a comprehensive system that brings novel experiences to its 2,000 internal users. It consists of building the information infrastructure and system, super applications for both desktop and mobile devices to enhance the work performance and quality.

Data is used to train models (e.g. acoustic models) and is 'forgotten'. Data is generated on-line from the different components of the SDS system, e.g. the dialog manager, as well as from the world it is interacting with (e.g. news streams, ambient sensors etc.). The data is used to evaluate and analyze conversational systems both on-line and off-line. We need to be able query such heterogeneous data for further processing. In this paper we present an approach with two novel components: first, an architecture for SDSs that takes a data-centric view, ensuring persistency and consistency of data as it is generated. The architecture is centered around a database that stores dialog data beyond the lifetime of individual dialog sessions, facilitating dialog mining, annotation, and logging. Second, we take advantage of the state-fullness of the data-centric architecture by means of a lightweight, reactive and inference-based dialog manager that itself is stateless. The feasibility of our approach has been validated within a prototype of a phone-based university help-desk application. We detail SDS architecture and dialog management, model, and data representation."

The data storage in clouds is not the only preference as big data technology is obtainable for processing of both structured and unstructured data. Today a colossal sum of data is engendered by mobile phones (Smartphone) of both the composition types.

The architecture is designed to be data-flow-oriented and reconfigurable such that several diverse visualization components can operate as one integrated system. Our prototype application allows users to visually analyze the results of a complex 3D network simulation data both on large high-resolution display and HTC Vive Head Mounted Display. The network simulation outputs variables describing various characteristics of network connectivity between the moving nodes on the ground and in the air interacting in a dynamically changing 3D environment. Our system uses 2D charting tools to visualize the statistical relationships between simulation variables. We developed a Unity application to animate the network simulation in a virtual environment showing the timevarying results in a 3D environment. The Unity application runs on a complete-immersive Head Mounted Display device. The 2D visualization framework running on our Large High-Resolution Display system supports multiple coordinated views across all the different 2D visualization components including a 2D map.

The conventional HPC systems are computing-centric and designed for computation-intensive applications. Scientific big data applications have growlingly different characteristics compared to big compute applications. These scientific applications, however, will still largely rely on HPC systems to be solved. In this research, we try to answer this question with a rethinking of HPC system architecture. We study and analyze the potential of a new decoupled HPC system architecture for data-intensive scientific applications. The fundamental idea is to decouple conventional compute nodes and dynamically provision as data processing nodes that focus on data processing capability. We present studies and analyses for such decoupled HPC system architecture. The current results have shown its promising potential.

With IP video distribution becoming increasingly realistic for a variety of low-latency applications, this paper looks ahead to a data-centric architecture for video that can provide a superset of features from existing abstractions, to support how video is increasingly being used: for non-linear retrieval, variable speed and spatially selective playback, machine analysis, and other new approaches. As a case study, the paper describes the use of the Named Data Networking (NDN) network architecture within an experimental theatrical work being developed at UCLA. The work, a new play, Entropy Bound, uses NDN to enable a hybrid design paradigm for real-time video that combines properties of streams, buses, and stores. This approach unifies real-time live and historical playback, and is used to support edge-assisted machine learning. The paper introduces the play and its requirements (as well as the NDN components applied and developed), discusses key design patterns enabled and explored and their influence on the application architecture, and describes what was learned through practical implementation in a realworld production setting. The paper intends to inform future experimentation with real-time media over information-centric networking and elaborate on the benefits and challenges of using NDN in practice for mixed reality applications today."

The system was divided into two independent parts. The first part is the data communication between the sensor network and the database. The other part is the data communication between the database and the user interface (UI). These two parts are connected by the database server. Asynchronous interoperation was introduced while exchanging data between these two parts. Users were not allowed to control the sensors through direct connection to the sensors and can only use the Web service to update the sensor profile built in the database. The sensors were triggered to start the action through a data-update event from the database. A sensor profile built in the database collected all sensor information and all user control command. For the information to be centralized and triggered by the database, regardless of whether sensors were measured in a periodic sampling or an event-driven environment, all sensor actions were triggered through a data-update event in the database. For the sake of improving user experience, a Web-based UI was implemented using scalable vector graphics (SVG) and Ajax technologies. All operations by users were conducted through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard method. Therefore, this system can be used via a browser and easily deployed.
