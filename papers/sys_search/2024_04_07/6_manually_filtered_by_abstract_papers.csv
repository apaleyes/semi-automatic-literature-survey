interventions made, thus far, towards Responsible AI would have been enough to
engage with root causes of AI problems. Failure to effect meaningful changes in
this system could see these initiatives to not reach their potential and lead
to the concept becoming another buzzword for companies to use in their
marketing campaigns. We propose that there is an opportunity to improve the
extent to which interventions are understood to be effective in their
contribution to the change required for Responsible AI. Using the notions of
leverage zones adapted from the 'Systems Thinking' literature, we suggest a
novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, to focus on
those that may bring about the real change that is needed. In this paper we
argue that insights from using this perspective demonstrate that the majority
of current initiatives taken by various actors in the field, focus on low-order
interventions, such as short-term fixes, tweaking algorithms and updating
parameters, absent from higher-order interventions, such as redefining the
system's foundational structures that govern those parameters, or challenging
the underlying purpose upon which those structures are built and developed in
the first place(high-leverage). This paper presents a conceptual framework
called the Five Ps to identify interventions towards Responsible AI and
provides a scaffold for transdisciplinary question asking to improve outcomes
towards Responsible AI.",0.8183542332228493

  explanations for machine learning transparency","The need for transparency of predictive systems based on Machine Learning
algorithms arises as a consequence of their ever-increasing proliferation in
the industry. Whenever black-box algorithmic predictions influence human
affairs, the inner workings of these algorithms should be scrutinised and their
decisions explained to the relevant stakeholders, including the system
engineers, the system's operators and the individuals whose case is being
decided. While a variety of interpretability and explainability methods is
available, none of them is a panacea that can satisfy all diverse expectations
and competing objectives that might be required by the parties involved. We
address this challenge in this paper by discussing the promises of Interactive
Machine Learning for improved transparency of black-box systems using the
example of contrastive explanations -- a state-of-the-art approach to
Interpretable Machine Learning.
  Specifically, we show how to personalise counterfactual explanations by
interactively adjusting their conditional statements and extract additional
explanations by asking follow-up ""What if?"" questions. Our experience in
building, deploying and presenting this type of system allowed us to list
desired properties as well as potential limitations, which can be used to guide
the development of interactive explainers. While customising the medium of
interaction, i.e., the user interface comprising of various communication
channels, may give an impression of personalisation, we argue that adjusting
the explanation itself and its content is more important. To this end,
properties such as breadth, scope, context, purpose and target of the
explanation have to be considered, in addition to explicitly informing the
explainee about its limitations and caveats...",0.8003887919818654

To reduce these risks to an acceptable level, AI companies need an effective risk management process and sound risk governance. In this paper, we explore a particular way in which AI companies can improve their risk governance: by setting up an AI ethics board. We identify five key design choices: (1) What responsibilities should the board have? (2) What should its legal structure be? (3) Who should sit on the board? (4) How should it make decisions? (5) And what resources does it need? We break each of these questions down into more specific sub-questions, list options, and discuss how different design choices affect the board’s ability to reduce societal risks from AI. Several failures have shown that designing an AI ethics board can be challenging. This paper provides a toolbox that can help AI companies to overcome these challenges.",0.8003887919818654

However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.",0.8183542332228493

This paper briefly examines the current state of AI-enabled applications and discusses the various risk containment strategies being implemented. Initial efforts focused on establishing high-level principles for responsible AI use. More recent strategies have sought to operationalize these principles through normative instruments, such as industry best practices and legal statutes, that govern AI applications and their creators. While valuable, such a top-down approach is not sufficiently effective; a complementary, bottom-up approach focused on strengthening the environment in which AI is deployed is also necessary. The paperanalyzestwospecificinitiativesaimedatenhancingthehumancomponentofAIdeployment(creating abetter-informed public through AI benchmarks, creating a better-equipped public with resources for local validation) and offers insights on how this environment-focused track can contribute to risk containment. Furthermore, we suggest additional steps for leveraging this approach in tandem with top-down strategies to cultivate a more robust risk mitigation framework.",0.815056125907337

  assurance of ml-based systems in the railway domain","Traditional automation technologies alone are not sufficient to enable
driverless operation of trains (called Grade of Automation (GoA) 4) on
non-restricted infrastructure. The required perception tasks are nowadays
realized using Machine Learning (ML) and thus need to be developed and deployed

MLOps process for tackling improved reproducibility, traceability,
collaboration, and continuous adaptation of a driverless operation to changing
conditions. MLOps mixes ML application development and operation (Ops) and
enables high frequency software releases and continuous innovation based on the
feedback from operations. In this paper, we outline a safe MLOps process for
the continuous development and safety assurance of ML-based systems in the
railway domain. It integrates system engineering, safety assurance, and the ML
life-cycle in a comprehensive workflow. We present the individual stages of the

This research project will explore the following three pillars: i) identify key quality attributes, formalize them in the context of data science pipelines and study their relationships; ii) define a new software engineering approach for data-science systems development that assures compliance with quality requirements; iii) implement tools that guide IT professionals and researchers in the realization of ML-based data science pipelines since the requirement engineering.
