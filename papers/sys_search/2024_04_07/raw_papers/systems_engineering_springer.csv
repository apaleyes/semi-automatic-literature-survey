LLM provides the mechanism for discovering embeddings for distinguishing between different behaviors present in log files. In this work, we are interested in discriminating between normal and anomalous behaviors via an unsupervised learning approach. To this end, firstly five recent LLM architectures are evaluated over six different log files. Then, further research is conducted to explicitly quantify the significance of performing self-supervised fine-tuning on the LLMs. Moreover, we show that the quality of an (unsupervised) feature map used to make the overall (normal/anomalous) predictions may also benefit from an AutoEncoder stage between LLM and feature map. Such an AutoEncoder provides significant reductions in the cost of training the feature map and typically improves the quality of the resulting predictions.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Signal,Image and Speech Processing', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Information and Communication, Circuits', 'R & D/Technology Policy']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12243-024-01028-2

ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI released in November 2022, has attracted global interest for its exceptionally high performance in generating human-like natural language answers to almost any questions a user queries. Its ability to generate knowledge raises questions about what human knowledge means in science education in the digital age. The researchers of this study consider ChatGPT as an epistemic agent that is capable of generating new scientific knowledge and as an eligible interviewee to provide data for the study of AI and human episteme. The researchers interviewed ChatGPT and analysed its responses to questions about the future of human epistemic agency in science education to elicit ontological and relational implications between humans and AI. Based on ChatGPT’s articulations, it was suggested that SOTA AI-generated knowledge is non-bodied , robust , and detached , which can be summarised as automatous . In contrast, it was suggested that human-generated knowledge is embodied , value-laden , and engaged , which can be summarised as personal , in light of Michael Polanyi’s thoughts. As a result, this study insists that there are still unique characteristics of human-generated scientific knowledge compared to those of AI. Therefore, it is suggested that AI in science education should be understood as a collaborator in knowledge construction while securing the lead of human students in this process.","['Education', 'Science Education', 'Philosophy of Science', 'History, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11191-024-00515-1

However, their adoption in HC organizations is still nascent as organizations often face a fragmented and incomplete picture of how they can capture the value of AI applications on a managerial level. To overcome adoption hurdles, HC organizations would benefit from understanding how they can capture AI applications’ potential. We conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review and 11 semi-structured expert interviews to identify, systematize, and describe 15 business objectives that translate into six value propositions of AI applications in HC. Our results demonstrate that AI applications can have several business objectives converging into risk-reduced patient care, advanced patient care, self-management, process acceleration, resource optimization, and knowledge discovery. We contribute to the literature by extending research on value creation mechanisms of AI to the HC context and guiding HC organizations in evaluating their AI applications or those of the competition on a managerial level, to assess AI investment decisions, and to align their AI application portfolio towards an overarching strategy.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Public Health', 'Health Administration', 'Health Informatics', 'Nursing Research']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-024-10894-4

It was supported by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering (DARE) program from the National Science Foundation’s Engineering Biology and Health Cluster. The conference brought together experts and trainees from around the world to discuss critical questions, challenges, and opportunities at the intersection of computational modeling and neurorehabilitation to understand, optimize, and improve clinical translation of neurorehabilitation. We organized the conference around four key, relevant, and promising Focus Areas for modeling: Adaptation & Plasticity, Personalization, Human-Device Interactions, and Modeling ‘In-the-Wild’. We identified four common threads across the Focus Areas that, if addressed, can catalyze progress in the short, medium, and long terms. These were: (i) the need to capture and curate appropriate and useful data necessary to develop, validate, and deploy useful computational models (ii) the need to create multi-scale models that span the personalization spectrum from individuals to populations, and from cellular to behavioral levels (iii) the need for algorithms that extract as much information from available data, while requiring as little data as possible from each client (iv) the insistence on leveraging readily available sensors and data systems to push model-driven treatments from the lab, and into the clinic, home, workplace, and community. The conference archive can be found at (dare2023.usc.edu). These topics are also extended by three perspective papers prepared by trainees and junior faculty, clinician researchers, and federal funding agency representatives who attended the conference.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurology', 'Rehabilitation Medicine', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12984-024-01324-x

Historically, the low reliability of purely structure-based design methods limited their application, but recent strategies that combine structure-based and sequence-based calculations, as well as machine learning tools, have dramatically improved protein engineering and design. In this Review, we discuss how these methods have enabled the design of increasingly complex structures and therapeutically relevant activities. Additionally, protein optimization methods have improved the stability and activity of complex eukaryotic proteins. Thanks to their increased reliability, computational design methods have been applied to improve therapeutics and enzymes for green chemistry and have generated vaccine antigens, antivirals and drug-delivery nano-vehicles. Moreover, the high success of design methods reflects an increased understanding of basic rules that govern the relationships among protein sequence, structure and function. However, de novo design is still limited mostly to α-helix bundles, restricting its potential to generate sophisticated enzymes and diverse protein and small-molecule binders. Designing complex protein structures is a challenging but necessary next step if we are to realize our objective of generating new-to-nature activities. Recent combinations of structure-based and sequence-based calculations and machine learning tools have dramatically improved protein engineering and design. Although designing complex protein structures remains challenging, these methods have enabled the design of therapeutically relevant activities, including vaccine antigens, antivirals and drug-delivery nano-vehicles.","['Life Sciences', 'Life Sciences, general', 'Cell Biology', 'Cancer Research', 'Developmental Biology', 'Stem Cells', 'Biochemistry, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41580-024-00718-y

Building on the notion that TMT effects are contingent upon firm contexts, we consider the moderating influence of a firm’s type (i.e., startups vs. incumbents). To investigate these relationships, we leverage observational literacy data of 6986 executives from a professional social network (LinkedIn.com) and firm data from 10-K statements. Our findings indicate that TMT AI literacy positively affects AI orientation as well as AI implementation ability and that AI orientation mediates the effect of TMT AI literacy on AI implementation ability. Further, we show that the effect of TMT AI literacy on AI implementation ability is stronger in startups than in incumbent firms. We contribute to upper echelons literature by introducing AI literacy as a skill-oriented perspective on TMTs, which complements prior role-oriented TMT research, and by detailing AI literacy’s role for the upper echelons-based mechanism that explains value generation with AI.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'e-Commerce/e-business']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12525-024-00707-1

However, due to its ubiquitous nature, we often perceive the world unconsciously, thereby overlooking the opportunity to contemplate the significance of sight. Seeing goes beyond being a mere method of gathering information; it is an act of uncovering new perspectives and engaging in profound exploration. Theories on creative problem-solving strongly advocate for the advantages of adopting multiple viewpoints. By generating a multitude of alternatives through information gleaned from diverse perspectives, we enhance our ability to expand the range of choices available to us, thus facilitating more effective problem-solving. In this paper, we present Posthuman CollectiveEyes, a digital platform that enriches the human act of visual perception by integrating diverse viewpoints such as collective human, augmented human, and nonhuman viewpoints, and constructs posthuman viewpoints from the diverse viewpoints. In the design of Posthuman CollectiveEyes, we adopt the more-than-human perspective, widely employed in the social sciences to analyze the impact of technology on human actions and decision-making in organizations and societies. This perspective enables us to uncover knowledge that conventional human-centered approaches cannot capture, as the objective of Posthuman CollectiveEyes is to expand human cognitive capabilities through enhanced visual perception. The novel contribution of our approach lies in demonstrating that the design of innovative digital platforms aimed at enhancing human abilities necessitates a fresh design approach that incorporates the more-than-human perspective.","['Computer Science', 'Multimedia Information Systems', 'Computer Communication Networks', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Special Purpose and Application-Based Systems']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-16868-8

Especially with the development of artificial intelligence, more and more researchers have devoted themselves to the field of robotics, but there are still many shortcomings in the multi-task operation of robots. Reinforcement learning has achieved good performance in manipulator manipulation, especially in grasping, but grasping is only the first step for the robot to perform actions, and it often ignores the stacking, assembly, placement, and other tasks to be carried out later. Such long-horizon tasks still face the problems of expensive time, dead-end exploration, and process reversal. Hierarchical reinforcement learning has some advantages in solving the above problems, but not all tasks can be learned hierarchically. This paper mainly solves the complex manipulation task of continuous multi-action of the manipulator by improving the method of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aiming to solve the task of long sequences such as stacking and alignment by proposing a framework. Our framework completes simulation experiments on various tasks and improves the success rate from 78.3% to 94.8% when cleaning cluttered toys. In the stacking toy experiment, the training speed is nearly three times faster than the baseline method. And our method can be generalized to other long-horizon tasks. Experiments show that the more complex the task, the greater the advantage of our framework.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10846-024-02078-3

The adoption of new technologies has a great impact on organizations, not only at an economic level but also on their products, processes, and human resources. This process will result in a series of necessary changes to align with their internal competencies and optimize the investment made. This digitalization generates a digital transformation that affects both large companies and SMEs, with the result that new technologies are subject to continuous change, requiring the development and training of workers with the necessary skills to cope with it. Within this transformation, the automation of processes is a constantly growing topic in the business world, as it generates a series of benefits for organizations that they would not otherwise be able to acquire. Process automation reduces the workload in repetitive processes and provides more time for employees to attend to end-customer requests. The adoption of this technology will provide the company to be adapted to a changing world experiencing an increase in productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency. This research focuses on how the process automation provides the organization with a wide range of benefits such as workload reduction and increased productivity for most of the company. Although process automation can bring many benefits to the workplace, it is important to recognize that its use does not always automatically lead to a systematic improvement of workers’ skills. In this context, it is also important to note how employee training is necessary to face this new reality. Employee training and adaptation is critical to the organization’s sustainability. Training will need to be aimed at equipping the employee with technical skills to enable them to effectively use and implement technology and to assimilate it as a complement and not as a threat. To analyse the individual’s awareness of the digitization of the workplace, the automation of tasks and the advantages or disadvantages that may result from the introduction of technology, a questionnaire was developed, and 103 valid responses were obtained and analysed. This has resulted in a series of hypotheses that have been tried to be validate throughout the research work. These results have important implications for organizations seeking to implement automation and provide a basis for future research in this constantly evolving field.","['Economics', 'Economic Policy', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Entrepreneurship']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13132-024-01865-5
Article,doi:10.1007/s42979-024-02714-7,text analysis on early reactions to chatgpt as a tool for academic progress or exploitation,SN Computer Science,10.1007/s42979-024-02714-7,Springer,2024-03-29,"Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention lately, and one particular implementation that has captivated users is ChatGPT, a first-of-its kind innovation that sparks intense debates among professionals regarding its ethical boundaries, especially after it was released for public use. Some of the debates are ongoing, with several people getting more used to this tool and some losing touch with several ethical concerns. Thus, it is crucial to explore the early professional’s perspectives surrounding ChatGPT to comprehend its potential impact on the educational sector and, in particular, society in general. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by employing data mining techniques on LinkedIn to analyze ChatGPT-related discussions and provide a comprehensive textual examination. The dataset for this investigation consists of 166 records written in English by LinkedIn users discussing ChatGPT in its early stage. The study utilized VOSviewer software to clean, analyze, mine, and visualize the data. Among the sample, it was observed that 49% of the users are PhD holders, predominantly with experience in scientific research and data science fields. Hence, the findings reveal that issues such as plagiarism, references, citations, manuscripts, papers, and literature reviews stand out as the major concerns. These results suggest that while ChatGPT can contribute to academic progress by fostering new knowledge, thoughts, and ideas, it can also facilitate academic misconduct, including plagiarism and inaccurate information dissemination. Therefore, this paper also provides discussions on the implications and ethical issues of ChatGPT. In particular, it is imperative to establish clear ethical boundaries and guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs in academic settings.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Science, general', 'Computer Systems Organization and Communication Networks', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Information Systems and Communication Service', 'Computer Imaging, Vision, Pattern Recognition and Graphics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42979-024-02714-7

Bash lacks sufficient training data compared to comment generation tasks in popular programming languages. Furthermore, collecting more real Bash code and corresponding comments is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we propose a two-module method named Bash2Com for Bash code comments generation. The first module, NP-GD, is a gradient-based automatic data augmentation component that enhances normalization stability when generating adversarial examples. The second module, MASA, leverages CodeBERT to learn the rich semantics of Bash code. Specifically, MASA considers the representations learned at each layer of CodeBERT as a set of semantic information that captures recursive relationships within the code. To generate comments for different Bash snippets, MASA employs LSTM and attention mechanisms to dynamically concentrate on relevant representational information. Then, we utilize the Transformer decoder and beam search algorithm to generate code comments. To evaluate the effectiveness of Bash2Com, we consider a corpus of 10,592 Bash code and corresponding comments. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, our experimental results show that Bash2Com can outperform all baselines by at least 10.19%, 11.81%, 2.61%, and 6.13% in terms of the performance measures BLEU-3/4, METEOR, and ROUGR-L. Moreover, the rationality of NP-GD and MASA in Bash2Com are verified by ablation studies.

Removal of these biases in T1w MRI images is a critical preprocessing step to ensure spatially consistent image interpretation. N4ITK bias field correction, the current state-of-the-art, is implemented in such a way that makes it difficult to port between different pipelines and workflows, thus making it hard to reimplement and reproduce results across local, cloud, and edge platforms. Moreover, N4ITK is opaque to optimization before and after its application, meaning that methodological development must work around the inhomogeneity correction step. Given the importance of bias fields correction in structural preprocessing and flexible implementation, we pursue a deep learning approximation / reinterpretation of the N4ITK bias fields correction to create a method which is portable, flexible, and fully differentiable. In this paper, we trained a deep learning network “DeepN4” on eight independent cohorts from 72 different scanners and age ranges with N4ITK-corrected T1w MRI and bias field for supervision in log space. We found that we can closely approximate N4ITK bias fields correction with naïve networks. We evaluate the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) in test dataset against the N4ITK corrected images. The median PSNR of corrected images between N4ITK and DeepN4 was 47.96 dB. In addition, we assess the DeepN4 model on eight additional external datasets and show the generalizability of the approach.

In a first step towards identifying challenges when specifying requirements for training data and runtime monitors, we conducted and thematically analysed ten interviews with practitioners who develop ML models for critical applications in the automotive industry. We identified 17 themes describing the challenges and classified them in six challenge groups. In a second step, we found interconnection between the challenge themes through an additional semantic analysis of the interviews. We explored how the identified challenge themes and their interconnections can be mapped to different architecture views. This step involved identifying relevant architecture views such as data, context, hardware, AI model, and functional safety views that can address the identified challenges.

In order to find high-quality comparative examples, this paper introduces the category information to construct a global graph, learning the association between categories for high-level preference interest of users. Then, a multi-layer perceptron is used to adaptively fuse the low-level preference interest features of the user’s items and the high-level preference interest features of the categories. Finally, user multi-interest contrastive samples are obtained through item sequence information and corresponding categories, which are fed into contrastive learning to optimize model parameters and generate multi-interest representations that are more in line with the user sequence. In addition, when modeling the user’s item sequence information, in order to increase the differentiation between item representations, the category of the item is used to supervise the learning process. Extensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing multi-interest recommendation models.","['Computer Science', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)', 'Database Management', 'Operating Systems']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-024-01263-6

We have become habituated to accept the use of well-constructed language to indicate intelligence, understanding and, consequently, intention, whether conscious or unconscious. But we are not always right to do so, and certainly not in the case of large language models (LLMs) like ChapGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA, and Google Bard. This is a perennial problem, but when one understands why it occurs, it ceases to be surprising that it so stubbornly persists. This paper will have three main sections. In the Introduction I will say a little about language, its aetiology, and useful sub-divisions into natural and cultural. In the second section I will explain the current situation with regard to large language models and fill in the background debates which set the problem up as one of increased complexity rather than one of a qualitatively different kind from narrow or specific AI. In the third section I will present the case for the missing phenomenological background and why it is necessary for the co-creation of shared meaning in both natural and cultural language, and I will conclude this section by presenting a rationale for why this situation arises and will continue to arise. Before we do any of this, I need to clarify one point: I do not wish to challenge the ascription of artificial general intelligence (AGI) to LLMs, indeed I think agnosticism is best in this respect, but I do challenge the more serious, and erroneous, ascription of understanding, intention, reason, and consciousness to them. And so, I am making two points: an epistemological one about why we fall into error in our ascription of a mental life to LLMs, and an ontological one about the impossibility of LLMs being or becoming conscious.","['Philosophy', 'Phenomenology', 'Philosophy of Mind', 'Cognitive Psychology']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11097-024-09970-1

This interplay is evident in online forums, where the organization of the threads interacts with the message’s meaning. Assessing readability in these discussions is vital for ensuring information comprehension among diverse audiences. This assessment is challenging due to the complexity of natural language compounded by the social and temporal dynamics within social networks. One practical approach involves aggregating multiple readability metrics as a consensus alignment. In this study, we explore whether the structural complexity of online discussions can predict consensus readability without delving into the semantics of the messages. We propose a consensus readability metric derived from well-known readability tests and a complexity metric applied to the tree structures of Reddit discussions. Our findings indicate that this proposed metric effectively predicts consensus readability based on the complexity of discourse structure.","['Computer Science', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Applications of Graph Theory and Complex Networks', 'Game Theory, Economics, Social and Behav.

Based on interviews with learning design practitioners across the world, and framed by theories of posthumanism and postdigital education, we share eight orientations that form a future and equity-oriented learning design pattern: awareness of context, matter matters, co-creating with humans and non-humans, relationality and connection, modelling vulnerability, the entanglement of the personal and political, and creating transformative spaces. We then use one of our responses to the advent of ChatGPT to show how these orientations have helped us in times of uncertainty and disruption, an agential cut that highlights the value of acknowledging the material-discursive relationships emerging in and through our work. As such, rather than focusing on conventional, static definitions and models, we are interested in knowledge-making processes that come into existence when we practise learning design and engage with each other and the world around us, and who we become in our relationships with others, both human and non-human, and the patterns that we form in this entanglement.","['Education', 'Technology and Digital Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational Philosophy']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42438-023-00420-w

The synergy between lifelong learning and sharing has the potential to create a society of AI systems, as each individual unit can contribute to and benefit from the collective knowledge. Essential to this vision are the abilities to learn multiple skills incrementally during a lifetime, to exchange knowledge among units via a common language, to use both local data and communication to learn, and to rely on edge devices to host the necessary decentralized computation and data. The result is a network of agents that can quickly respond to and learn new tasks, that collectively hold more knowledge than a single agent and that can extend current knowledge in more diverse ways than a single agent. Open research questions include when and what knowledge should be shared to maximize both the rate of learning and the long-term learning performance. Here we review recent machine learning advances converging towards creating a collective machine-learned intelligence. We propose that the convergence of such scientific and technological advances will lead to the emergence of new types of scalable, resilient and sustainable AI systems.

Each gradient map was created from the original voxel data, and each value represented the amount of information per volume. Here, the gradient map was defined by several methods that mathematically quantify and represent the detailed structure of an object. By applying this map to the loss function in training, we could induce the network to intensively train partial details, such as thin and narrow parts. We demonstrated that the detailed information was well-recovered when a weight that is proportional to the gradient value was applied to the loss.

Integrating AI with emerging technologies in the Metaverse creates new possibilities for immersive experiences that were previously impossible. This paper explores how AI is integrated with technologies such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, Natural Language Processing, virtual reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and Extended Reality. One potential benefit of using AI in the Metaverse is the ability to create personalized experiences for individual users, based on their behavior and preferences. Another potential benefit of using AI in the Metaverse is the ability to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time and resources for more complex and creative endeavors. However, there are also challenges associated with using AI in the Metaverse, such as ensuring user privacy and addressing issues of bias and discrimination. By examining the potential benefits and challenges of using AI in the Metaverse, including ethical considerations, we can better prepare for this exciting new era of VR. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI and its integration with other emerging technologies in the Metaverse, as the Metaverse continues to evolve and grow, it will be important for developers and researchers to stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and emerging technologies to fully leverage their potential.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-023-10641-x

Although AI makes education more accessible and efficient, the intentional misuse of AI chatbots in facilitating academic cheating has become a growing concern. By using the indirect questioning technique via a list experiment to minimize social desirability bias, this research contributes to the ongoing dialog on academic integrity in the era of AI. Our findings reveal that students conceal AI-powered academic cheating behaviors when directly questioned, as the prevalence of cheaters observed via list experiments is almost threefold the prevalence of cheaters observed via the basic direct questioning approach. Interestingly, our subsample analysis shows that AI-powered academic cheating behaviors differ significantly across genders and grades, as higher-grade female students are more likely to cheat than newly enrolled female students. Conversely, male students consistently engage in academic cheating throughout all grades. Furthermore, we discuss potential reasons for the heterogeneous effects in academic cheating behavior among students such as gender disparity, academic-related pressure, and peer effects. Implications are also suggested for educational institutions to promote innovative approaches that harness the benefits of AI technologies while safeguarding academic integrity.","['Computer Science', 'Computers and Education', 'Educational Technology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Education, general', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)', 'Computer Appl. in Social and Behavioral Sciences']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12495-4

Technical issues such as tool support have gained significant research before, but individual guidance and training have received little attention. As a first step towards providing the necessary guidance in modelling, we conduct a systematic literature review to explore the current state of the art. We searched academic literature for guidance on model creation and selected 35 papers for full-text screening through three rounds of selection. We find research on model creation guidance to be fragmented, with inconsistent usage of terminology, and a lack of empirical validation or supporting evidence. We outline the different dimensions commonly used to provide guidance on software and system model creation. Additionally, we provide definitions of the three terms modelling method, style, and guideline as current literature lacks a well-defined distinction between them.

Research suggests that groups can exhibit ""collective intelligence""—the ability to perform well across tasks—under certain conditions, making group performance somewhat predictable. However, predictability of task performance becomes difficult when a task relies heavily on coordination among group members or is ill-defined. To address this issue, we propose a technical solution in the form of a chatbot providing advice to facilitate group work for more predictable performance. Specifically, we target well-defined, high-coordination tasks. Through experiments with 64 virtual groups performing various tasks and communicating via text-based chat, we found a relationship between the average intelligence of group members and their group performance in such tasks, making performance more predictable.

However, the complexity of the underlying mechanisms of AI systems can render it difficult for humans to understand and trust AI-driven decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly evolving field that addresses this challenge, providing human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. Based on a systematic literature survey, We explore the latest techniques and approaches that are helping manufacturers gain transparency in the decision-making processes of their AI systems. In this survey, we focus on two of the most exciting areas of XAI: ontology-based and semantic-based XAI (O-XAI, S-XAI, respectively), which provide human-readable explanations of AI decisions by exploiting semantic information. These latter types of explanations are presented in natural language and are designed to be easily understood by non-experts. Translating the decision paths taken by AI algorithms to meaningful explanations through semantics, O-XAI, and S-XAI enables humans to identify various cross-cutting concerns that influence the decisions made by the AI system. This information can be used to improve the performance of the AI system, identify potential biases in the system, and ensure that the decisions are aligned with the goals and values of the manufacturing organization. Additionally, we highlight the benefits and challenges of using O-XAI and S-XAI in manufacturing and discuss the potential for future research, aiming to provide valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners looking to leverage the power of ontologies and general semantics for XAI.","['Business and Management', 'Production', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-023-02304-z

Given the proliferation of technological tools such as ChatGPT and other LLMs for solving cognitive tasks, how should educational practices incorporate the use of such tools without undermining the cognitive character of students? Pritchard ( 2014 , 2016 ) argues that it is possible to properly solve this ‘technology-education tension’ (TET) by combining the virtue epistemology framework with the theory of extended cognition (EXT) (Clark and Chalmers,  1998 ). He argues that EXT enables us to consider tools as constitutive parts of the students’ cognitive system, thus preserving their cognitive character from technologically induced cognitive diminishment. The first aim of this paper is to show that this solution is not sufficient to solve the TET. Second, I aim to offer a complementary and more encompassing framework of tool-use to address the TET. Then, I apply it to the educational uses of ChatGPT as the most notable example of LLM, although my arguments can be extended to other generative AI systems. To do so, in Sect.  1.1 , I present Pritchard’s framework of cognitive character and virtue epistemology applied in education, to which I am committed in this treatment. In Sects.  2 and 3 , I respectively illustrate Pritchard’s ( 2014 ) solution to the TET, and I highlight the general limitations of his proposal.

A medical decision support system (MDSS) emerges from the integration of a data system with resources for medical decision-making. Within MDSS, human-computer interaction and perceptual medical decision-making stand out as two highly valuable technologies. Systems enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), which leverage decentralized, diverse communication and networking technology to cater to a wide range of end-users, are referred to as pervasive computing. A challenging aspect of pervasive computing is ensuring transparency in interaction, managing administration levels, and accommodating varying tolerance levels for widely dispersed users. This paper presents a uniquely flexible MDSS framework designed to enhance end-user confidence in the availability of MDSS through ubiquitous IoT devices within the context of HCI. This architecture utilizes recurring training to assess resource allocation based on demand and collaborative characteristics. Projected resource requirements enable pervasive computing to better serve end-users by reducing latency and increasing communication speeds for MDSS in HCI. The primary goal of this framework is to simplify the management of terminal transitions by facilitating the allocation and utilization of resources for data transfer from peripheral technology. Experimental analysis is employed to estimate the framework’s performance, utilizing various metrics to demonstrate its consistency. These metrics encompass responsiveness, transaction success rates, processed demands, application caseloads, capacity utilization, and memory usage. The uniquely flexible and distributed computing framework optimizes request handling, network accuracy, and memory utilization, resulting in reduced transaction failures and lower latency, ultimately leading to shorter response times. The proposed UFDSS maintains a transaction failure rate below 25% with increasing requests and achieves 100 MHz bandwidth utilization, surpassing other techniques capped at 80 MHz. UFDSS exhibits a lower average latency of around 30 ms for a range of energy data inputs. This uniquely flexible MDSS framework showcases its potential to enhance MDSS availability through IoT devices within HCI contexts. By optimizing resource allocation and utilization, it successfully reduces latency, improves communication speeds, and ultimately leads to shorter response times, contributing to more efficient and reliable medical decision support. Further, integrating generative AI into MDSS for IoT-based HCI could also enhance data-driven decision support.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computation by Abstract Devices', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Biology/Bioinformatics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-023-10242-4

In particular, the migration of their resources is facilitated by recent advances in the area of virtualization techniques. This contributes to increase the dynamics of their configuration, and may induce vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of cloud resources, or even of the whole service. In addition, cloud providers may be reluctant to share precise information regarding the configuration of their infrastructures with cloud tenants that build and deploy cloud composite services. This makes the assessment of vulnerabilities difficult to be performed with only a partial view on the overall configuration. We therefore propose in this article an inter-cloud trusted third-party approach, called C3S-TTP, for supporting secure configurations in cloud composite services, more specifically during the migration of their resources. We describe the considered architecture, its main building blocks and their interactions based on an extended version of the TOSCA orchestration language. The trusted third party is capable to perform a precise and exhaustive vulnerability assessment, without requiring the cloud provider and the cloud tenant to share critical configuration information between each other.

Awareness of social sustainability is crucial in digital business development and management, as such business makes both positive and negative societal impacts globally and within local communities. For example, adoption of advanced technologies in digital business may result in the need for workforce re-skilling, potential job losses, changes in consumer behavior, and the ability to either obscure or enhance transparency in global value chains. To promote digitalization that is socially sustainable, this chapter offers hands-on exercises grounded in Kolb’s experiential learning framework.

For this, most existing approaches consider event logs as input data and therefore only depict how work was performed (as-is) and neglect information on how work should be performed (to-be), i.e., whether or not the actual execution is in compliance with the execution specified by the company or law. To bridge this gap, the presented approach considers event logs and natural language texts as input outlining rules on how resources are supposed to work together and which information may be exchanged between them. For pre-processing the natural language texts the large language model GPT-4 is utilized and its output is fed into a customized organizational mining component which delivers the to-be organizational perspective. In addition, we integrate well-known process discovery techniques from event logs to gather the as-is perspective. A comparison in the form of a graphical representation of both, the to-be and as-is perspectives, enables users to detect deviating behavior. The approach is evaluated based on a set of well-established process descriptions as well as synthetic and real-world event logs.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Computing Milieux', 'Artificial Intelligence']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-46846-9_19

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, it has become a dominant technology in tasks that involve large amounts of data, including images, text, and sequence data. Deep neural networks, which are the brains behind deep learning models, have led to advances in computer vision and natural language processing as well as speech recognition. Deep learning models have a hierarchical feature learning structure that enables them to understand complex relationships and patterns in data. Larger language algorithms (a subset of deep learning) have revolutionized the way we understand and generate natural language.

In machine learning (ML), self-learning algorithms extract information from data and represent the solutions in convenient forms. ML broadly consists of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

This chapter surfaces this often-invisible labor, highlighting several key issues around its poor or nonexistent remuneration, exploitative mechanisms, negative impact on well-being, and extractive colonial logics. The chapter suggests several interventions, from concrete policy to corporate responsibility, that might lead to improvements.

For natural language queries to relational databases, the neural semantic parsing task Text-to-SQL achieves strong performance in translating text inputs to SQL queries. However, very few public corpora are available for the training of neural semantic parsing models that convert textual queries to graph query languages. In this research, we develop a generic SQL2Cypher algorithm that can map a SQL query to a set of Cypher clauses, where Cypher is a query language used by a popular property graph database Neo4j. The converted Cypher statement is then combined with the original natural language query to create a parallel corpus that enables end-to-end training of neural semantic parsing models for Text-to-Cypher. To evaluate the dataset quality, we construct a corresponding graph database to obtain execution accuracy. In addition, the Text-to-Cypher corpus features four transformer-based baseline models. The availability of such corpus and baseline models is critical in developing and benchmarking new machine learning methods in advancing natural language interfaces for fact retrieval from large graph-based knowledge repositories.

However, the time-consuming but required step of designing formal business process models often hampers the potential of these systems. To overcome this challenge, automated generation of business process models from natural language text has emerged as a promising approach to expedite this step. Generally two crucial subtasks have to be solved: extracting process-relevant information from natural language and creating the actual model. Approaches towards the first subtask are rule based methods, highly optimized for specific domains, but hard to adapt to related applications. To solve this issue, we present an extension to an existing pipeline, to make it entirely data driven. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our improved pipeline, which not only eliminates the substantial overhead associated with feature engineering and rule definition, but also enables adaptation to different datasets, entity and relation types, and new domains. Additionally, the largest available dataset (PET) for the first subtask, contains no information about linguistic references between mentions of entities in the process description. Yet, the resolution of these mentions into a single visual element is essential for high quality process models. We propose an extension to the PET dataset that incorporates information about linguistic references and a corresponding method for resolving them.

Drawing upon this perspective, this chapter delves into the theoretical and practical implications of the findings obtained in the current monograph, with a particular focus on the pivotal role played by transformational leadership (TFL) in navigating the complex, multifaceted landscape of DX. It elucidates the skills required for TFL leaders, explicating the difficulties associated with identifying and nurturing such leaders. Three distinct approaches to procuring digitally skilled leaders, each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages, are also outlined. Additionally, this chapter underscores the unique capability of TFL leaders to reframe arduous DX-induced challenges as opportunities for growth. As a future direction, the potential and challenges of a “hybrid” approach that integrates various leadership styles are contemplated. Furthermore, this chapter problematizes the concept of job performance vis-à-vis the uncertainty level of a given DX environment to delineate a future research agenda. Limitations of the current research are clarified to encourage future studies to critique and build upon the obtained findings to develop theories that guide leaders across diverse sectors toward successful DX initiatives.","['Business and Management', 'Human Resource Management', 'Personality and Social Psychology', 'Industrial and Organizational Psychology', 'Self and Identity', 'Self and Identity']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-8409-1_5

It stated that humans and architecture (as machines) are both designers. However, with the rapid growth of AI in recent years, misusing AI has resulted in social problems, as named the “pandemics of today's AI” by Paul Pangaro. This paper aims to find insights into the causes and potential ways of taming the situation, followed by proposing a paradigm for developing HCI-based architecture in the future. Key HCI-based projects and recent developments will be analysed through major academia and research bodies. This research identifies three findings, including blurred definitions of interactivity, loss of physicality and lack of real-world application. Hence, we propose focusing on Human-Machine Conversation (HMC) as a more directed approach to developing HCI in architecture. This focus emphasises the “machine” as a focus on the physical built environment and “conversation” as the most critical interaction for future architecture.","['Engineering', 'Building Construction and Design', 'Arts', 'Mathematics in Art and Architecture']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-0621-1_2

It is clear that these social media sites are filled with more data, which can also mean more difficulties for humans to quickly retrieve or extract specific information according to their needs. Thus, it is more convenient to use automatic keywords, which can be seen as an unsupervised learning problem. Here, we consider a text document as a set of words from the document content. To face this challenge, in this paper, several keyword algorithms, namely KeyBERT, Yake, Rake, etc., have been exploited, and evaluated. The performance of each algorithm was compared with a dataset of news articles written in French language collected from different online news sites in Senegal. The overall ranking result obtained from the experiment using the basic state-of-the-art evaluation methods shows that the Rake extractor achieved a significant improvement in terms of efficiency and time when extracting keywords with 88% of the keywords that most closely match human readers and took 142 seconds when extracting the keywords from the set of documents in our corpus used. Moreover, with our best algorithm presented, journalists or media professionals can use it to improve their work process. This could lead to the emergence of online journalism. Moreover, the list of keywords obtained from our best model can be used for a variety of applications such as document indexing.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-8031-4_29

However, in Latin America this perspective seems less dazzling since these technologies have just started to be used recently. For this research, social representations are conceived as the set of different kinds of knowledge, common sense, and ideas each person uses for understanding daily-life contexts and situations. Considering this, this research was designed using a socio-constructivism framework, and for creating this qualitative approach, phenomenological design. For data collection, semi-structured interviews were implemented to a sample of 13 Peruvian and 9 Colombian students. It had the aim of answering the following questions: what do young people think about technologies related to artificial intelligence? What do they know about it? How is artificial intelligence connected to their lives? What are they afraid of regarding artificial intelligence? What are their expectations about it? Data analysis was carried out through ATLAS.ti qualitative analysis software codification. Findings have shown students consider artificial intelligence as intelligent machines capable of reasoning and problem-solving. Furthermore, some stated artificial intelligence is absent from their lives, while others stated it is present in their daily lives every day. Besides, another group of young people stated artificial intelligence will turn out to be an embodied entity in human lives, even getting over humans.

However, existing cross-modal retrieval models designed with multi-modal pre-training commonly rely on real-value storage, resulting in high computation and storage costs that hinder their applicability on large-scale practical applications. On the other hand, cross-modal retrieval models that utilize hash storage methods often overlook the potential benefits of multi-modal pre-training methods, leading to limited generalization and semantic extraction abilities for constructing a robust semantic subspace. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal hashing framework called CCMH (CLIP-based Cross-Modal Hashing), which facilitates the transferability of a well-trained real-value semantic subspace to a hash semantic subspace. We conduct comparative analysis between CCMH and six commonly-used benchmarks under two datasets, and we find that our proposed CCMH shows competitive performance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of CCMH on transferring real-value semantic subspace to hash semantic subspace, and our method offers valuable insights for future research in the field of cross-modal hashing.","['Engineering', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Signal, Image and Speech Processing', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Circuits and Systems']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-9021-4_48

On the one hand, cross-encoders constitute an effective solution for re-ranking when considering a single relevance dimension such as topicality, but are not designed to straightforwardly account for additional relevance dimensions. On the other hand, the majority of re-ranking models accounting for multdimensional relevance are often based on the aggregation of multiple relevance scores at the re-ranking stage, leading to potential compensatory effects. To address these issues, in the proposed solution we enhance the candidate documents retrieved by a first-stage lexical retrieval model with suitable relevance statements related to distinct relevance dimensions, and then perform a re-ranking on them with cross-encoders. In this work we focus, in particular, on an extra dimension of relevance beyond topicality, namely, credibility, to address health misinformation in the Consumer Health Search task.

In-depth discussions on these principles provide engineers and designers with a robust framework for enhancing the reliability of products, systems, and processes. The chapter proceeds to dissect powerful design techniques, emphasizing the critical role of the Design of Experiments (DOE), tolerance analysis, and quality control in improving reliability. Systematically addressing variations and uncertainties, engineers can develop products and systems that consistently meet performance standards, even under adverse conditions. System resilience and redundancy analysis are explored extensively, focusing on diverse types of redundancy and implementing failover mechanisms to absorb shocks and recover from disruptions. Risk assessment is a central element, as the paper guides readers through identifying critical parameters, quantifying risks, and developing effective risk mitigation strategies. Through compelling case studies and best practices, this paper offers practical insights into how RCD and resilience principles are applied across industries.

To facilitate this task, we design a code reviewer recommender that operates on the knowledge units (KUs) of a programming language. We define a KU as a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We operationalize our KUs using certification exams for the Java programming language. We detect KUs from 10 actively maintained Java projects from GitHub, spanning 290K commits and 65K pull requests (PRs). We generate developer expertise profiles based on the detected KUs. We use these KU-based expertise profiles to build a code reviewer recommender (KUREC). We compare KUREC’s performance to that of seven baseline recommenders. KUREC ranked first along with the top-performing baseline recommender (RF) in a Scott-Knott ESD analysis of recommendation accuracy (the top-5 accuracy of KUREC is 0.84 (median) and the MAP@5 is 0.51 (median)). From a practical standpoint, we highlight that KUREC’s performance is more stable (lower interquartile range) than that of RF, thus making it more consistent and potentially more trustworthy. We also design three new recommenders by combining KUREC with our baseline recommenders. These new combined recommenders outperform both KUREC and the individual baselines. Finally, we evaluate how reasonable the recommendations from KUREC and the combined recommenders are when those deviate from the ground truth. We observe that KUREC is the recommender with the highest percentage of reasonable recommendations (63.4%). Overall we conclude that KUREC and one of the combined recommenders (e.g., AD_HYBRID) are overall superior to the baseline recommenders that we studied. Future work in the area should thus (i) consider KU-based recommenders as baselines and (ii) experiment with combined recommenders.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-023-10421-9

These models can be utilized by a group of collaborating entities in emergency situations to decide how they share resources and mitigate adverse effects on human lives. Due to the sudden spikes in demand, the allocation of healthcare resources becomes dynamic in nature. Medical resource management underwent an unprecedented level of difficulty in the modern history of our healthcare system because of the Coronavirus pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, we witnessed a severe shortage of ventilators in several countries including in the U.S. Followed by that, there was a severe shortage of Oxygen supply in treating patients who tested positive for the virus in India. Many lives were unnecessarily lost because of the lack of a resource-sharing framework to use in an adverse situation. When a hospital or region experiences sudden spikes in demand for resources, the key decision involves sending resources from other places. Especially, a swift optimal decision has to be made regarding who will send the resources and when will it be sent to the places of need. To tackle this problem, we developed three analytics models—MILP, DQL, and DDQL—based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)’s public data of ventilator allocation. To the best of our knowledge, DQL and DDQL are introduced in this context for the first time. Our models can be used either to share critical resources between collaborators or transfer patients between the locations of the collaborators. We devise two policies for DQL and DDQL models while optimizing the parameters in them. We call these policies the normal policy and the just ship policy. The just ship policy promptly ships healthcare resources to save patients in other locations even at the risk of not meeting its own demand in the future. The normal policy allows saving resources at a location so that future demands are met at the location rather than satisfying the current demand at other locations. To demonstrate the performance of our models, we applied our models to the IHME’s ventilator data and present the results for all fifty states in the U.S. We show how these models optimize ventilator allocations assuming that all the fifty states collaborate as a task force and implement the solution that emerges from the analytics. The experimental results show that the proposed models are effective in handling the resource sharing problem presented by Covid-19.

Emergent AI technologies may enable novel operations that evade detection and influence public discourse on social media with greater scale, reach, and specificity. New methods of detection with inductive learning capacity will be needed to identify novel operations before they indelibly alter public opinion and events. To this end, we develop an inductive learning framework that: (1) determines content- and graph-based indicators that are not specific to any operation; (2) uses graph learning to encode abstract signatures of coordinated manipulation; and (3) evaluates generalization capacity by training and testing models across operations originating from Russia, China, and Iran. We find that this framework enables strong cross-operation generalization while also revealing salient indicators-illustrating a generic approach which directly complements transductive methodologies, thereby enhancing detection coverage.","['Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary', 'Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary', 'Science, multidisciplinary']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49676-z

However, it is difficult to assess students' engagement and provide process-oriented feedback on their collaboration due to limited resources and scalability challenges. This paper presents an empirical study examining the application of Machine Learning (ML) to evaluate student engagement in PBL. A supervised ML model (SML) was developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict engagement levels using conversation data in online chat groups and comparing them to the ground truth metrics. Eleven teams of engineering students participated in the PBL courses on systems engineering while employing text-based discussions. Communication messages were manually labelled for active engagement metrics collected in our prior research. The SML was constructed with Gradient Boosting to classify engagement levels. The model was trained using more than 5,000 manually classified text messages, and it demonstrated an accuracy range of 0.75 to 0.81 on held-out test data. The model's predictions for complete team communication showed a meaningful association with the actual levels of engagement as determined by log data and surveys. Moreover, the model reproduces general patterns of team engagement and collaboration. According to the findings, conversational data can be a scalable source for ML-driven engagement assessment. This shows how AI has the potential to scale up process-oriented assessment in PBL. Future research should look towards instructor-AI dashboards and individualized feedback systems. The work adds an empirical evaluation of AI for automated engagement analysis, extending earlier research on feedback systems to tackle PBL issues.","['Computer Science', 'Computers and Education', 'Educational Technology', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Education, general', 'Information Systems Applications (incl.Internet)', 'Computer Appl. in Social and Behavioral Sciences']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-12381-5

In this article, we offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of generative AI with its underpinning concepts and prospects. We provide a conceptual introduction to relevant terms and techniques, outline the inherent properties that constitute generative AI, and elaborate on the potentials and challenges.

However, previous research on trust in online environments lacks a systematic configuration of trust entities in research models; some studies include either trust in technology or trust in provider, others both. In combination with inconsistent results, this leads to a lack of in-depth knowledge about the trust entities’ relationship to each other, to their antecedents, and intention to use. Therefore, this study aims at clarifying these relationships and examining how they vary for different configurations. We performed pairwise meta-analyses to generate summary effects for the individual trust entities and examined four different trust configurations by applying meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Our findings advance technology acceptance and trust research and highlight the necessity to carefully configure trust. More specifically, the results from pairwise meta-analysis support a strong relationship between the trust entities that is, however, countered by the effects of antecedents in MASEM. Institution-based trust and reputation are found stronger predictors for trust in provider and familiarity a stronger determinant of trust in technology. Furthermore, the trust entities show comparable paths to intention to use when either trust entity is included in the research model, but when both are integrated, trust in technology is more important than trust in provider.","['Business and Management', 'IT in Business', 'e-Commerce/e-business']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12525-023-00672-1

However, despite an increasing number of climate pledges, the emissions pathways of most companies are still misaligned with the Paris targets. To identify the causes of this discrepancy between effort and outcome, we developed a systematic approach, based on extensive analyses of textual data, to track the actions implemented by major public corporations to reduce their emissions. Our findings suggest that the misalignment between companies’ climate goals, actions, and outcomes is due to a widespread over-investment in risk mitigation actions as opposed to innovation and cooperation activities to foster energy goals. Overall, we provide a systematic framework to track companies’ climate actions. Our approach can be used by investors and policymakers to redirect capital towards its most sustainable use and to design behaviourally founded climate policy interventions. The emissions pathways of most publicly traded companies in high-emitting sectors are not aligned with the climate targets of the Paris Agreement. An extensive analysis of companies’ sustainability behaviour offers insights into why this is the case.","['Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary', 'Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary', 'Science, multidisciplinary']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43116-2

Despite stark differences, there are core similarities between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases, it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology. Recently, generative AI has garnered a lot of attention in the medical research community, leading to debates about its application in the healthcare sector, mainly due to concerns about transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, questions around the potential exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However, the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied. As a result, there are no clear solutions to address ethical concerns, and decision-makers often neglect to consider the significance of ethical principles before implementing generative AI in clinical practice. In an attempt to address these issues, we explore ethical principles from the military perspective and propose the “GREAT PLEA” ethical principles, namely Governability, Reliability, Equity, Accountability, Traceability, Privacy, Lawfulness, Empathy, and Autonomy for generative AI in healthcare. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for adopting and expanding these ethical principles in a practical way that has been useful in the military and can be applied to healthcare for generative AI, based on contrasting their ethical concerns and risks. Ultimately, we aim to proactively address the ethical dilemmas and challenges posed by the integration of generative AI into healthcare practice.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Biomedicine, general', 'Biotechnology']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-023-00965-x

They are gladly and frequently used for text production by many people. These tools have undeniable strengths but also weaknesses that must be addressed. In this squib we ask to what extent these tools can be employed by users for individual learning as well as for knowledge construction to spark a collective endeavor of developing new insights. We take a social, collective notion of knowledge as a basis and argue that users need to establish a dialog that goes beyond knowledge telling (simply writing what one knows) and stimulates knowledge transformation (converting knowledge into complex relational argumentation structures). Generative AI tools do not have any conceptual knowledge or conscious understanding, as they only use word transitions and rely on probabilities of word classes. We suggest, however, that argumentative dialogs among humans and AI tools can be achieved with appropriate prompts, where emergent processes of joint knowledge construction can take place. Based on this assumption, we inquire into the human and into the AI parts of communication and text production. For our line of argument, we borrow from research on individual and collaborative writing, group cognition, and the co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. We outline future CSCL research paths that might take the human-AI co-construction of knowledge into account in terms of terminology, theory, and methodology.","['Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Learning and Instruction', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction', 'Computers and Education', 'Cognitive Psychology']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11412-023-09409-w

Traditionally, most BPM decisions and activities are undertaken by business stakeholders based on manual data collection and analysis techniques. This is time-consuming and potentially leads to suboptimal decisions, as only a restricted subset of data and options are considered. Over the past decades, a rich set of data-driven techniques has emerged to support and automate various activities and decisions across the BPM lifecycle, particularly within the process mining field. More recently, the uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for BPM has led to a range of approaches for proactive business process monitoring. Given their common data requirements and overlapping goals, process mining and AI-driven approaches to business process optimization are converging. This convergence is leading to a promising emerging concept, which we call (AI-)augmented process execution : a collection of data analytics and artificial intelligence methods for continuous and automated improvement and adaptation of business processes.

Generally, ML methods are best suited to projects with a large amount of readily available data, either within existing databases or that can be gathered via high-throughput experimentation. This is because most ML methods are developed to efficiently extract valuable and often hidden information from large datasets to transform data into knowledge. However, for a significant number of projects in novel materials development, high-throughput experimentation is not an option, rendering databases rather sparse. This occurs from materials discovery through deployment across myriad target applications. The challenge in such projects is not primarily how best to analyze the gathered data but, more importantly, how best to gather data to maximize efficiency in knowledge generation. This paper provides an overview of four basic methods of systematic gathering of experimental data, namely, classical Design of Experiments, Optimal Design, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and Bayesian Optimization.

While code smell detection using machine learning has progressed significantly, there still appears to be a gap in understanding the effective utilization of deep learning (DL) approaches. This paper aims to review and identify current methods for code smell detection using DL techniques. A systematic literature review is conducted on 35 primary studies from a collection of 8739 publications between 2013 and the present. The analysis reveals that common code smells detected include Feature Envy, God Classes, Long Methods, Complex Classes, and Large Classes.

This review article, which doubles as an editorial to Digital Society’s topical collection on ‘Auditing of AI’, provides an overview of previous work in the field. Three key points emerge from the review. First, contemporary attempts to audit AI systems have much to learn from how audits have historically been structured and conducted in areas like financial accounting, safety engineering and the social sciences. Second, both policymakers and technology providers have an interest in promoting auditing as an AI governance mechanism. Academic researchers can thus fill an important role by studying the feasibility and effectiveness of different AI auditing procedures. Third, AI auditing is an inherently multidisciplinary undertaking, to which substantial contributions have been made by computer scientists and engineers as well as social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and industry practitioners. Reflecting this diversity of perspectives, different approaches to AI auditing have different affordances and constraints. Specifically, a distinction can be made between technology-oriented audits, which focus on the properties and capabilities of AI systems, and process-oriented audits, which focus on technology providers’ governance structures and quality management systems. The next step in the evolution of auditing as an AI governance mechanism, this article concludes, should be the interlinking of these available—and complementary—approaches into structured and holistic procedures to audit not only how AI systems are designed and used but also how they impact users, societies and the natural environment in applied settings over time.","['Computer Science', 'Computers and Society', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'IT Law, Media Law, Intellectual Property', 'Philosophy of Technology']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s44206-023-00074-y

Based on the stereotype content model, this paper explores the impact of two universally usable failure recovery messages as a strategy to preserve users’ post-recovery satisfaction and chatbot re-use intentions. Results of three experiments show that chatbot recovery messages have a positive effect on recovery responses, mediated by different elicited social cognitions. In particular, a solution-oriented message elicits stronger competence evaluations, whereas an empathy-seeking message leads to stronger warmth evaluations.

Existing electricity market models often use centralized rule-based bidding or global optimization approaches, which may not accurately capture the competitive behavior of market participants. To address this issue, we present a novel method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to model individual strategies in electricity market models. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach using a detailed model of the German wholesale electricity market with a complete fleet of pumped hydro energy storage units represented as learning agents. We compare the results to widely used modeling approaches and demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and can accurately represent the competitive behavior of market participants. To understand the benefits of using reinforcement learning, we analyze overall profits, aggregated dispatch, and individual behavior of energy storage units. The proposed method can improve the accuracy and realism of electricity market modeling and help policymakers make informed decisions for future market designs and policies.","['Computer Science', 'Information Systems and Communication Service']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42162-023-00293-0

That promise is already delivering extremely impressive results in a variety of areas. However, while DL-enabled systems achieve excellent performance, they are far from perfect. It has been demonstrated, in several domains, that DL systems can err when they encounter cases they had not hitherto encountered. Furthermore, the opacity of the produced agents makes it difficult to explain their behavior and ensure that they adhere to various requirements posed by human engineers. At the other end of the software development spectrum of methods, behavioral programming (BP) facilitates orderly system development using self-standing executable modules aligned with how humans intuitively describe desired system behavior. In this paper, we elaborate on different approaches for combining DRL with BP and, more generally, machine learning (ML) with executable specifications (ES). We begin by defining a framework for studying the various approaches, which can also be used to study new emerging approaches not covered here. We then briefly review state-of-the-art approaches to integrating ML with ES, continue with a focus on DRL, and then present the merits of integrating ML with BP. We conclude with guidelines on how this categorization can be used in decision making in system development, and outline future research challenges.","['Computer Science', 'Information Systems and Communication Service']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11432-022-3826-6

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive performance in linguistic tasks such as question answering and logical inference, demonstrating strong linguistic intelligence. This paper proposes an assistant painting creation approach to provide precise content control for painting generation by combining LLMs with text-to-image generative models and evaluates the performance of the proposed approach on painting content generation and painting element arrangement. The experimental results show that our approach can provide clear guidance on rich painting content and reasonable arrangements of painting elements, demonstrating its ability of text-based painting scene imagination.

However, the generated code will not always adhere to syntactic constraints of the target language, especially in the case of Turducken-style code, where declarative code snippets are embedded within imperative programs. In this study, we summarize three significant challenges in regards to syntactic constraints: (1) the efficient representation of syntactic constraints, (2) the effective integration of syntactic information, and (3) the scalable syntax-first decoding algorithm. To address these challenges, we propose a syntax-guided multi-task learning approach TurduckenGen . Specifically, we first explicitly append the type information to the code tokens to capture the representation of syntactic constraints. Then we formalize code generation with syntactic constraint representation as an auxiliary task to enable the model to learn the syntactic constraints of the code. Finally, the syntactically correct code is selected accurately from the multiple candidates with the help of the compiler feedback. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of our approach after being compared with six state-of-the-art baselines on two Turducken-style code datasets.

These cooperative aspects of work are individually and socially valuable, and so they must be given a central place when evaluating the impact of AI upon work. Workplace technologies are not simply instruments for achieving productive goals, but ways of mediating interpersonal relations. They are aspects of a cooperative interface i.e. the infrastructure by which we engage cooperative behavior with others. The concept of the cooperative interface suggests two conjectures to foreground in the social alignment agenda, motivated by the experience of algorithmic trading and social robotics: that AI impacts cooperation through its effects on social networks, and through its effects on social norms.","['Philosophy', 'Ethics', 'Political Philosophy', 'Moral Philosophy', 'Social Philosophy', 'History of Philosophy', 'Metaphysics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10892-023-09449-2

Based on our analysis, researchers have utilized three main approaches for SA, namely lexicon/rules, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). The performance of lexicon/rules-based models typically falls within the range of 55–85%. ML models, on the other hand, generally exhibit performance ranging from 55% to 90%, while DL models tend to achieve higher performance, ranging from 70% to 95%. These ranges are estimated and may be higher or lower depending on various factors, including the quality of the datasets, the chosen model architecture, the preprocessing techniques employed, as well as the quality and coverage of the lexicon utilized. Moreover, to further enhance models’ performance, researchers have delved into the implementation of hybrid models and optimization techniques which have demonstrated an ability to enhance the overall performance of SA models.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Probability and Statistics in Computer Science', 'Computational Science and Engineering', 'Image Processing and Computer Vision', 'Computational Biology/Bioinformatics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-08941-y

Taking the UK’s Online Safety bill as the paradigm example of the new laws, the article analyses the concept of harmful communication at three levels: society, organisation, and subject. It identifies a shift in the law’s epistemic approach to communication, by which individuals are reconfigured from agential subjects into contingent users, whose capacities are determined by the structure of online communication platforms. In this configuration, norms previously considered indispensible are relegated to second-order effects of the affordances of media. Arguing that it is insufficient to merely reaffirm subjective rights in light of this shift, the article suggests systems theoretical analysis as a means of identifying lines of critique.","['Philosophy', 'Philosophy of Law', 'Theories of Law, Philosophy of Law, Legal History', 'Human Rights', 'Gender Studies', 'Cultural Studies']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10978-023-09353-6

However, service mesh introduces new notions and enables complex capabilities such as sidecar proxies that inevitably bring major adoption concerns. Objective We investigate the adoption concerns in two dominant open-source service mesh frameworks via a mixed-methods empirical investigation of the past, current and evolution of 5,497 practitioner questions posted on generic and framework-specific question-and-answer fora. Method We first mine the topics of questions with the help of Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM). We identify evolution by applying topic modelling to time periods and aggregating topics into macro-topics. We conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the three major types of questions and to generalize common fix patterns for the extracted error symptoms. We consulted a service mesh domain expert to provide feedback on our findings and discuss implications. Results We found that about half of the questions are error-related and mined 18 topics, covering service mesh traffic, infrastructure, security, observability and application. We discovered a drastic decline in traffic-related concerns while finding persisting infrastructure-related concerns and a rise in security and observability concerns. We identified 54 error symptoms from two popular service mesh frameworks and generalized 9 common fix patterns. We found complex symptom-to-fix relationships, yet, surprisingly, minimal configuration changes were able to fix most symptoms. Conclusion Providing consistent documentation and practical automation that assists customization of service mesh deployment and functionalities is crucial in the current service mesh domain, given the diversity of discovered intentions, goals and symptoms. Furthermore, there should be more work towards better container orchestration to deploy service mesh frameworks and reliable customization of security and observability service mesh features.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-023-10348-1

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most promising emerging technologies of our time. Similar to other technologies, AI is expected by many “to meet [human] needs”. In this article, we reflect on the relationship between needs and AI, and call for the realization of needs-aware AI systems.

When the disruption event COVID-19 occurred, however, people’s demand for breakthrough research, such as vaccinations or treatments, became increasingly pressing. Under such circumstances, can the accumulated coronavirus-related knowledge still give solid support for COVID-19 research? The manner of utilizing and absorbing new knowledge in the citing publications is reflected in the reference analysis. To investigate this proposition, we employ reference analysis to conduct retrospectives on relevant scientific articles. We locate 309,517 related papers and their references in the CORD-19 data from 2000 to 2021. We analyze the knowledge support capacity of previous studies from three aspects: the quantity, timeliness, and textual support of references. Among them, textual support is divided into lexical, topic, and semantic support, which are respectively based on TF-IDF, LDA, and fine-tuned sentence-BERT. Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has caused unprecedented destruction of the original knowledge support pattern in the early stages of research (which is at odds with the knowledge support pattern in the general scientific background). The long-term accumulated and non-direct knowledge provides brief support for the COVID-19 investigation. Follow-up research will swiftly replace outdated information with new study findings. The appeal of the scientific community has moved from “return to the past” to “innovative alternatives”. We divide the process into three stages: rearrangement, iteration, and growth. The loss in knowledge support capacity following a disruptive event such as COVID-19 enhances the difficulty of research. However, it cannot be ignored that it has also considerably sped the pace of knowledge production.","['Computer Science', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Library Science']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-023-04764-9

The AI for (social) good movement is a manifestation of this trend in which almost any application used in the context of healthcare or agriculture can be classified as AI for good regardless of whether such applications have been evaluated from a broader perspective. In this paper, we aim to create a common understanding of what the ‘AI for Sustainability’ movement ought to mean. We distinguish between two possible AI for Sustainability applications, namely those that fulfill the necessary conditions and those that fulfill the sufficient conditions. The former are purely predictive systems that serve as information providers. The latter are directly involved in an activity that contributes to a sustainability goal. We argue that taking action is a key element in distinguishing between these two application groups, as inaction is the key bottleneck in effectively tackling climate change. Furthermore, we question how effective the use of AI applications can be for sustainability when the systems themselves are inherently unsustainable. Hence, AI for Sustainability should include both an action that contributes to a sustainable end goal as well as an investigation of the sustainability issues of the AI system itself. Following that, Sustainable AI research can be on a gradient: AI in an application domain, AI towards sustainability, and AI for Sustainability.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Ethics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00323-3

Each high- Q nanoantenna exhibits average resonant quality factors of 2,200 in physiological buffer. We quantitatively detect two gene fragments, SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) and open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), with high-specificity via DNA hybridization. We also demonstrate femtomolar sensitivity in buffer and nanomolar sensitivity in spiked nasopharyngeal eluates within 5 minutes. Nanoantennas are patterned at densities of 160,000 devices per cm 2 , enabling future work on highly-multiplexed detection. Combined with advances in complex sample processing, our work provides a foundation for rapid, compact, and amplification-free molecular assays.

Since Palliative Care is traditionally distant from digitalization due to its holistically person-centered approach, there is a lack of suitable concepts enabling digitalization regarding multi-professional team processes. Yet, a digitalised information and collaboration environment geared to the requirements of palliative care and the needs of the members of the multi-professional team might facilitate communication and collaboration processes and improve information and knowledge flows. Taking this chance, the presented three-year project, PALLADiUM, aims to improve the effectiveness of Palliative Care teams by jointly sharing available inter-subjective knowledge and orientation-giving as well as action-guiding practical knowledge. Thus, PALLADiUM will explore the potentials and limitations of digitally supported communication and collaboration solutions. Methods PALLADiUM follows an open and iterative mixed methods approach. First, ethnographic methods – participant observations, interviews, and focus groups – aim to explore knowledge and information flow in investigating Palliative Care units as well as the requirements and barriers to digitalization. Second, to extend this body, the analysis of the historical hospital data provides quantitative insights. Condensing all findings results in a to-be work system. Adhering to the work systems transformation method, a technical prototype including artificial intelligence components will enhance the collaborative teamwork in the Palliative Care unit. Discussion PALLADiUM aims to deliver decisive new insights into the preconditions, processes, and success factors of the digitalization of a medical working environment as well as communication and collaboration processes in multi-professional teams.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy.

However, the widespread use of LLMs is also coupled with significant ethical and social challenges. Previous research has pointed towards auditing as a promising governance mechanism to help ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in ways that are ethical, legal, and technically robust. However, existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, which display emergent capabilities and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this article, we address that gap by outlining a novel blueprint for how to audit LLMs. Specifically, we propose a three-layered approach, whereby governance audits (of technology providers that design and disseminate LLMs), model audits (of LLMs after pre-training but prior to their release), and application audits (of applications based on LLMs) complement and inform each other. We show how audits, when conducted in a structured and coordinated manner on all three levels, can be a feasible and effective mechanism for identifying and managing some of the ethical and social risks posed by LLMs. However, it is important to remain realistic about what auditing can reasonably be expected to achieve. Therefore, we discuss the limitations not only of our three-layered approach but also of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all. Ultimately, this article seeks to expand the methodological toolkit available to technology providers and policymakers who wish to analyse and evaluate LLMs from technical, ethical, and legal perspectives.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Ethics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00289-2

Although researchers have long proposed the use of MMC technology in clinical measurement—identification and measurement of movement kinematics in a clinical population, its actual application is still in its preliminary stages. The benefits of MMC technology are also inconclusive with regard to its use in assessing patients’ conditions. In this review we put a minor focus on the method’s engineering components and sought primarily to determine the current application of MMC as a clinical measurement tool in rehabilitation. Methods A systematic computerized literature search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and IEEE. The search keywords used in each database were “Markerless Motion Capture OR Motion Capture OR Motion Capture Technology OR Markerless Motion Capture Technology OR Computer Vision OR Video-based OR Pose Estimation AND Assessment OR Clinical Assessment OR Clinical Measurement OR Assess.” Only peer-reviewed articles that applied MMC technology for clinical measurement were included. The last search took place on March 6, 2023. Details regarding the application of MMC technology for different types of patients and body parts, as well as the assessment results, were summarized. Results A total of 65 studies were included. The MMC systems used for measurement were most frequently used to identify symptoms or to detect differences in movement patterns between disease populations and their healthy counterparts. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) who demonstrated obvious and well-defined physical signs were the largest patient group to which MMC assessment had been applied. Microsoft Kinect was the most frequently used MMC system, although there was a recent trend of motion analysis using video captured with a smartphone camera. Conclusions This review explored the current uses of MMC technology for clinical measurement. MMC technology has the potential to be used as an assessment tool as well as to assist in the detection and identification of symptoms, which might further contribute to the use of an artificial intelligence method for early screening for diseases. Further studies are warranted to develop and integrate MMC system in a platform that can be user-friendly and accurately analyzed by clinicians to extend the use of MMC technology in the disease populations.","['Biomedicine', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurology', 'Rehabilitation Medicine', 'Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12984-023-01186-9

We first give a high level introduction to SL linguistics and MT to illustrate the requirements of automatic SL translation. Then, we present a systematic literature review of the state of the art in the domain. Finally, we outline important challenges for future research.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors and strategies that hindered and facilitated effective implementation of new critical care practices and policies in response to the pandemic. Methods We used a cross-sectional, qualitative study design to conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews with critical care leaders across the United States. The interviews were audio-taped and professionally transcribed verbatim. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), three qualitative researchers used rapid analysis methods to develop relevant codes and identify salient themes. Results Among the 17 hospitals that agreed to participate in this study, 31 clinical leaders were interviewed. The CFIR-driven rapid analysis of the interview transcripts generated 12 major themes, which included six implementation facilitators (i.e., factors that promoted the implementation of new critical care practices) and six implementation barriers (i.e., factors that hindered the implementation of new critical care practices). These themes spanned the five CFIR domains (Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, Characteristics of Individuals, and Process) and 11 distinct CFIR constructs. Salient facilitators to implementation efforts included staff resilience, commitment, and innovation, which were supported through collaborative feedback and decision-making mechanisms between leadership and frontline staff. Major identified barriers included lack of access to reliable and transferable information, available resources, uncollaborative leadership and communication styles. Conclusions Through applying the CFIR to organize and synthesize our qualitative data, this study revealed important insights into implementation determinants that influenced the uptake of new critical care practices during COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to burden critical care units, clinical leaders should consider emulating the effective change management strategies identified. The cultivation of streamlined, engaging, and collaborative leadership and communication mechanisms not only supported implementation of new care practices across sites, but it also helped reduce salient implementation barriers, particularly resource and staffing shortages. Future critical care implementation studies should seek to capitalize on identified facilitators and reduce barriers.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Public Health', 'Health Administration', 'Health Informatics', 'Nursing Research']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-023-09209-w

However, it is becoming clear that the methods that have made this possible are subject to several limitations that might inhibit progress towards replicating the more general intelligence seen in humans and other animals. In contrast to current AI methods that focus on specific tasks and rely on large amounts of offline data and extensive, slow, and mostly supervised learning, this natural intelligence is quick, versatile, agile, and open-ended. This position paper brings together ideas from neuroscience, evolutionary and developmental biology, and complex systems to analyze why such natural intelligence is possible in animals and suggests that AI should exploit the same strategies to move in a different direction. In particular, it argues that integrated embodiment, modularity, synergy, developmental learning, and evolution are key enablers of natural intelligence and should be at the core of AI systems as well. The analysis in the paper leads to the description of a biologically grounded deep intelligence (DI) framework for understanding natural intelligence and developing a new approach to building more versatile, autonomous, and integrated AI. The paper concludes that the dominant paradigm of AI today is unlikely to lead to truly natural general intelligence and that something like the biologically inspired DI framework is needed for that.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computation by Abstract Devices', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Biology/Bioinformatics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-023-10124-9

Our ability to attribute the generated text to a specific LLM will not only help us understand differences in the LLMs’ output characteristics, but also effectively distinguish machine-generated text from human-generated text. In this paper, we study whether a machine learning model can be effectively trained to attribute text to the underlying LLM that generated it. We propose an ensemble neural model that generates probabilities from multiple pre-trained LLMs, which are then used as features for a traditional machine learning classifier. The proposed approach is tested on Automated Text Identification (AuTexTification) datasets in English and Spanish languages. We find that our models outperform various baselines, achieving macro $$F_{macro}$$ F macro scores of 0.63 and 0.65 for English and Spanish texts, respectively.","['Computer Science', 'Computer Applications']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-7254-8_54

Existing approaches assume that requirements are available in a formalized manner using, e.g., linear temporal logic, leaving the question open of how to automatically extract and formalize them for verification. Especially with the constantly growing amount of regulatory documents and their frequent updates, it can be preferable to provide an approach that enables the verification of processes with requirements in natural language text instead of formalized requirements. To this end, this paper presents an approach that copes with the verification of resource compliance requirements, e.g., which resource shall perform which activity, in natural language over event logs. The approach relies on a comprehensive literature analysis to identify resource compliance patterns. It then contrasts these patterns with resource patterns reflecting the process perspective, while considering the natural language perspective.

Depression causes cognitive and motor changes that affect speech production: reduction in verbal activity productivity, prosodic speech irregularities, and monotonous speech have all been shown to be symptomatic of depression. In this study, we aim to provide a deep learning-based model that could give an initial diagnosis of mental health problems for individuals and screen the risk of developing mental health issues.

If automatic misinformation detection is applied in a real-world setting, it is necessary to validate the methods being used. Large language models (LLMs) have produced the best results among text-based methods. However, fine-tuning such a model requires a significant amount of training data, which has led to the automatic creation of large-scale misinformation detection datasets. In this paper, we explore the biases present in one such dataset for misinformation detection in English, NELA-GT-2019.

A downside of conformance checking, though, is that it requires a process model as a basis, limiting its applicability, whereas existing anomaly detection techniques look for statistically infrequent behavior, even though infrequency does not necessarily imply undesirability. The recently introduced concept of semantic anomaly detection overcomes these issues by detecting behavior that stands out from a semantic point of view, such as a claim being paid after it has been rejected. In this manner, it detects behavior that is undesirable, while its grounding in natural language analysis allows it to consider behavioral regularities extracted from other processes, alleviating the need to have a process model available. However, the state-of-the-art approach for semantic anomaly detection, a rigid, rule-based approach, is limited in its scope and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based alternative, which uses a classifier trained to recognize whether observed process behavior is normal or anomalous. Our experiments show that this learning-based approach greatly outperforms the state of the art. Users can directly apply our approach to detect semantic anomalies in their own event data by using one of our pre-trained classifiers, even if their data contains so far unseen process behavior.","['Computer Science', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Data Structures and Information Theory', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Algorithm Analysis and Problem Complexity', 'e-Commerce/e-business', 'Computer Applications']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41620-0_10

Size recommendations assume that for every article there is a size that fits the customer’s body. However, fit recommendations require more fine-grained information to be able to predict the fitting experience and to steer customers to appropriate articles. This requires an understanding of the shape and expected fit of an article, which are not always readily available. In this study, we show how customer reviews can be leveraged to identify topics corresponding to customer concerns and to common issues of the item purchase and post-purchase experience. We empirically evaluate three typologically different topic extraction methods (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, text embedding clustering and zero-shot text classification) in the highly complex domain of real-world fashion reviews and analyse their pros and cons. We demonstrate that coarse-grained topic labels correspond to item’s fit issues, such as “too big” and “too small” and show how fine-grained topics signal other specific fit issues of an article (e.g. “short leg length” for jeans or “loose sleeve area” for upper garments).","['Computer Science', 'Machine Learning', 'e-Commerce/e-business', 'Popular Culture', 'Social Media', 'Privacy']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22192-7_1

Interactive behaviour has a sequential (actions happen one after another) and hierarchical (a sequence of actions forms an activity driven by interaction goals) structure, which may be similar to the structure of natural language. Designed based on such a structure, natural language processing (NLP) methods have achieved groundbreaking success in various downstream tasks. However, few works linked interactive behaviour with natural language. In this paper, we explore the similarity between interactive behaviour and natural language by applying an NLP method, byte pair encoding (BPE), to encode mouse and keyboard behaviour. We then analyse the vocabulary, i.e., the set of action sequences, learnt by BPE, as well as use the vocabulary to encode the input behaviour for interactive task recognition. An existing dataset collected in constrained lab settings and our novel out-of-the-lab dataset were used for evaluation. Results show that this natural language-inspired approach not only learns action sequences that reflect specific interaction goals, but also achieves higher F1 scores on task recognition than other methods. Our work reveals the similarity between interactive behaviour and natural language, and presents the potential of applying the new pack of methods that leverage insights from NLP to model interactive behaviour in HCI.","['Computer Science', 'User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42286-7_1

Based on the fact that programs can inherently be represented by graphs and to leverage recent advances in graph neural networks, we propose a novel method to generate synthetic code graphs for data augmentation to enhance vulnerability discovery. Our method includes two significant contributions: a novel approach for generating synthetic code graphs and a graph-to-code transformer to convert code graphs into their code representation.

State-of-the-art approaches for VMR often rely on large amounts of training data including frame-level saliency annotations, weakly supervised pre-training on speech captions, and signals from additional modalities such as audio, which can be limiting in practical scenarios. Moreover, most of these approaches make use of pre-trained spatio-temporal backbones for aggregating temporal features across multiple frames, which incurs significant training and inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot approach with sparse frame-sampling strategies that does not rely on additional modalities and performs well with feature extraction from just individual frames. Our approach uses Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training based models (BLIP/BLIP-2), which have been shown to be effective for various downstream vision-language tasks, even in zero-shot settings. We show that such models can be easily repurposed as effective, off-the-shelf feature extractors for VMR. On the QVHighlights benchmark for VMR, our approach outperforms both zero-shot approaches and supervised approaches (without saliency score annotations) by at least $$25\%$$ 25 % and $$21\%$$ 21 % respectively, on all metrics.

It is shown that the use of the central nervous system in SEMS allows them to independently formulate goals and successfully fulfill them without human intervention. The problems of formalizing the linguistic meaning of a language are discussed, namely alphabets and rules for constructing signs (words) from letters, from signs of sentences, as well as rules for understanding the meaning of sentences, forming new sentences and transferring them to others. Proposed logical-probabilistic and logical–linguistic methods of forming images based on sensory data and creating a language of sensations of robots. Methods, algorithms and systems for image classification in the central nervous system are described. Particular attention is paid to the problems of endowing SEMS with elements of the psyche when making decisions as part of human–machine systems. It is shown that on the basis of the proposed algorithms for taking into account the influence of the emotions of “pleasure” and “self-preservation” by processing the SEMS sensory signals and analyzing statistical data and computer simulation results, it is possible to form optimal routes for mobile SEMS, taking into account these emotions of passengers. This eliminates conflict situations between members of human–machine systems. The existing types of classifications of human temperament are analyzed. It has been shown that it is advisable to use three methods for classifying human temperament in the SEMS of the CNS. Constitutional, based on the analysis of human images. Interactive, based on the analysis of a person's answers to the questions of the questionnaire. Behavioral, based on the analysis of the characteristics of human behavior in various situations. In this case, the choice of the type of temperament of the diagnosed person can be carried out on the basis of the choice of the maximum degree of belonging of a person to a certain type of temperament after using all three types of classification. The results of computer simulation of driving a car along a given route by drivers of different temperaments with a robot-assistant (navigator) for the minimum time for passing the route without accidents and without exceeding the maximum speed are presented. It is shown that taking into account the driver's temperament allows minimizing the time of accident-free passage of the route, and not taking into account the temperament can lead to accidents when cornering.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Mechanical Engineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36052-7_2

The growth in old goods, as well as their negative environmental and social consequences, prompted supply chain operators to focus more on reverse logistics for collecting and reusing these items. However, there are a few key issues that should be handled in this manner, covering how to implement an effective collecting plan. What categories of used items should be collected? And how should they be handled for the aim of reusing them? To address these questions, the pricing issues are investigated in a CLSC with a manufacturer and two retailers. As an effective collection strategy, the first retailer, along with selling new products, benefits from the product exchange program (PEP). In this program, the retailer, by offering two types of discounts on a new product’s price, is able to collect two types of products, including those without and with useful lifetime left as the first- and second-category products, respectively. In terms of used products management, the first-category products are sent to the manufacturer for recycling, and the second-category ones are sold as second-hand products by the first retailer. Besides, the first retailer exercises a full refund return policy, where the returned defective products, after being remanufactured by the manufacturer, are sold to customers by the second retailer in the secondary market. With respect to buy back price of first-category products from the first retailer, two scenarios are considered: 1) the manufacturer pays as much as the difference between the original retail price and discounted retail price in order to encourage the retailer to offer exercise the PEP for returned used items, or 2) by considering the discount on wholesale price, the manufacturer pays as much as the difference between the original wholesale price and discounted wholesale price. In this study, a real-world case study is considered based on an Iranian automotive industry to understand the issue better and obtain practical results. The findings show that the second scenario is more profitable due to lower selling prices and greater demand rates. It is proved that the PEP along with providing environmental benefits can improve supply chain financial profit even for the first or the second-category products.","['Environment', 'Environment, general', 'Environmental Chemistry', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Environmental Health', 'Atmospheric Protection/Air Quality Control/Air Pollution', 'Waste Water Technology / Water Pollution Control / Water Management / Aquatic Pollution']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22671-z

Pilot contamination (PC) arises because the non-orthogonal pilot sequences transmitted by users in a cell similar to the nearby cells is one of the blockages in m-MIMO to avail the essential goals. In the current paper, we intended an intelligent pilot assignment policy to substantially extenuate the potency of PC in the multi-cells m-MIMO system. Based on the intended strategy, the entire users are divided based on their large-scale fading into two groups, i.e., High contaminate $${\text{K}}_{\text{H}}$$ K H and low contaminate $${\text{K}}_{\text{L}}$$ K L users. Likewise, $${\text{K}}_{\text{H}}$$ K H is assigned by orthogonal pilots due to high inter-cell-interference (ICI) and to extenuate the extreme PC, whereas non-orthogonal sets of pilots are dedicated to $${\text{K}}_{\text{L}}$$ K L . Afterward, severe PC among $${\text{K}}_{\text{H}}$$ K H almost vanished, whereas a slight problem of PC still exists among $${\text{K}}_{\text{L}}$$ K L , which deteriorates the system efficiency. Thus, a competent approach based on hyper-graph-coloring-based pilot allocation (HCPA) is projected to overwhelm the PC of $${\text{K}}_{\text{L}}$$ K L . However, the simulation effects expose that the proposed strategy extremely stimulates both attainable sum-rate and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINRs). Furthermore, the proposed strategy is extremely efficient to suppress PC and optimize the entire system efficiency.","['Engineering', 'Computational Intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Statistics, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-9331-2_37

However, checking privacy compliance is challenging and depends on many factors, such as the programming language and the software architecture, as well as the underlying regulation. In this exploratory research, we aim to study whether positive discussions on privacy-related issues in Open-Source Software (OSS) environments can predict privacy compliance of the software. Such predictions are beneficial in different scenarios, including in software reuse. Our main contribution will lie in conceptually modeling and understanding the relations between privacy compliance and positive discussions of privacy-related OSS issues. The research comprises three parts: (1) identifying privacy-related issues using supervised machine learning techniques; (2) improving the identification of privacy-related issues utilizing ontologies; and (3) identifying the sentiment of privacy-related issues and analyzing relations to privacy compliance. This paper describes the design and results of part 1, as well as the design of parts 2 and 3.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Computer Applications', 'Theory of Computation']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47112-4_6

In this paper, we systematically review the existing financial fraud detection technologies, focusing on deep learning-based financial fraud detection methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically introduce financial fraud detection methods based on transformer models, including the most recent pre-training transformer models, which can be thought of as parametric knowledge.

The European Commission’s draft of the AI Act has further fueled these discussions, particularly in relation to the definition of AI and the assignment of risk levels to different technologies. Security concerns in AI systems arise from the need to protect against potential adversaries and to safeguard individuals from AI decisions that may harm their well-being. However, ensuring secure and trustworthy AI systems is challenging, especially with deep learning models that lack explainability. This paper proposes the concept of Controllable AI as an alternative to Trustworthy AI and explores the major differences between the two. The aim is to initiate discussions on securing complex AI systems without sacrificing practical capabilities or transparency. The paper provides an overview of techniques that can be employed to achieve Controllable AI. It discusses the background definitions of explainability, Trustworthy AI, and the AI Act. The principles and techniques of Controllable AI are detailed, including detecting and managing control loss, implementing transparent AI decisions, and addressing intentional bias or backdoors. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of Controllable AI and its implications for real-world scenarios.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Database Management', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Mathematical Logic and Formal Languages']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-40837-3_1

Much algorithmic research is done, but examples of AI bringing tangible benefits to the healthcare industry are rare. We argue that one of the reasons for low adoption rates is missing domain understanding and/or the heterogeneity of domain understanding among the DDSS developers and domain experts. To overcome this, we are working towards a methodology to utilize the Domain Engineering approach to create a shared common understanding of key concepts and relationships within the healthcare domain in a structured, formalized way. In the realm of complex interdisciplinary DDSS development within healthcare, the Domain Engineering approach can serve as a valuable instrument for bridging the gap between IT professionals and domain experts. It facilitates establishing a shared comprehension of the domain and hopefully contributes significantly to increasing the value and adoption rates of DDSSs in the clinical process.

There is a considerable interest in developing strategies for selecting an optimal set of samples to train such large models for biomedical tasks because developing training data is expensive and time consuming in the biomedical space. Lack of sufficient training data is exacerbated by the fact that the ratio of negative samples to positive samples is also highly skewed, i.e., too many negative samples but too few positive samples. Therefore, an important problem, especially for the biomedical space, what is the optimum set of negative samples to use in creating an effective and balanced training data sample. Interestingly though, the insights which may help to decide the most effective sample selection can be found in the data itself (i.e., in the samples themselves).

It provides the reader with pointers in financial markets particularly directed in outlining the future role of crypto finance, artificial intelligence, and sustainable finance. The chapter re-evaluates the importance of confidence in financial markets, and it analyses the mechanisms behind its restoring process at the inception or in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Paradoxically confidence stands, simultaneously, as a synonym for certainty and uncertainty. Proclamations of confidence are frequently used as substitutes for substantive action. Within this fragile and delicate equilibrium in economics the chapter provides consolidating remarks and reveals the verisimilitude of the financial stage, namely that money does not have intrinsic value and that the financial system depends upon the plausibility of narratives of wealth and commerce performed by those best positioned to know those narratives: speculators and insiders.","['Finance', 'Capital Markets', 'International Finance', 'Finance, general', 'Financial History']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47901-4_7

In particular, support tickets are documented insufficiently due to time pressure and lack of motivation. Following design science research, we design and evaluate an analytics pipeline to address the data quality issue. The pipeline can be applied to assess and extract high-quality support tickets for subsequent model training and operation. Based on a data set of 60.000 real-life support tickets from a manufacturing company, we develop the artifact, instantiate a recommender system and achieve a higher prediction performance in comparison to naïve enrichment methods. In terms of data management literature, we contribute to the understanding of assessing textual ticket data quality.

To meet the Paris Agreement, a profound transformation of global energy systems is required from fossil fuel-based to low or zero carbon sources. This creates a risk for hydrocarbon-producing countries such as Qatar, which depend on fuel exports for income. In the short term, Qatar is well suited for the energy transition due to its abundance of natural gas, a widely acceptable transition fuel. Technological improvement in renewable energy as well as fast moving competition in the hydrogen market, showcase Qatar’s hydrocarbon export vulnerabilities.

In this perspective article, we synthesize historical approaches to understanding intelligent systems and argue that methodological and epistemic biases in these fields can be resolved by shifting away from cognitivist brain-as-computer theories and recognizing that brains exist within large, interdependent living systems. Integrating the dynamical systems view of cognition with the massive distributed feedback of perceptual control theory highlights a theoretical gap in our understanding of nonreductive neural mechanisms. Cell assemblies—properly conceived as reentrant dynamical flows and not merely as identified groups of neurons—may fill that gap by providing a minimal supraneuronal level of organization that establishes a neurodynamical base layer for computation. By considering information streams from physical embodiment and situational embedding, we discuss this computational base layer in terms of conserved oscillatory and structural properties of cortical-hippocampal networks. Our synthesis of embodied cognition, based in dynamical systems and perceptual control, aims to bypass the neurosymbolic stalemates that have arisen in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computation by Abstract Devices', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Biology/Bioinformatics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12559-022-10081-9

Consequently, the intersection of healthcare and data analytics has received scientific attention to the point of numerous secondary studies. We analyze studies on healthcare data analytics, and provide a wide overview of the subject. This is a tertiary study, i.e., a systematic review of systematic reviews. We identified 45 systematic secondary studies on data analytics applications in different healthcare sectors, including diagnosis and disease profiling, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and sepsis. Machine learning and data mining were the most widely used data analytics techniques in healthcare applications, with a rising trend in popularity.

Realizing that methods such as word-line shifting, usage of spaces, replacement of the word with its synonym are fragile against steganalysis, led to new searches and it was determined that deep learning models were more resistant to detecting the presence of hidden words. In this study, the text generation based on the information that is wanted to be hidden without a carrier text, both at word and character level, was performed. Arithmetic coding, perfect tree and Huffman coding methods were used as secret information embedding methods in text generation based on word level. In this part of the study, bidirectional LSTM architecture with attention mechanism was created as language model. In text generation based on character level, a new secret information embedding algorithm is created by combining the LZW compression algorithm with the Char Index (LZW-Char Index Encoding) method. The character-level model is created as a result of using the encoder–decoder architecture together with bidirectional LSTM and Bahdanau attention. The proposed method was evaluated from the perspectives of information embedding efficiency, information imperceptibility and hidden information capacity.

The present study investigated the susceptibility of a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) N95, surgical mask, cotton fabric mask and N95 straps under three different doses of UV-C, applying both real-time PCR (qPCR) and plaque formation assays to quantify viral load reduction and virus infectivity, respectively. The results show that more than 95% of the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be reduced after 10 min of UV-C exposure (0.93 J cm −2 per side) in FFR N95 and surgical masks and, after 5 min of UV-C treatment (0.46 J cm −2 per side) in fabric masks. Furthermore, the analysis of viable coronaviruses after these different UV-C treatments demonstrated that the lowest applied dose is sufficient to decontaminate all masks ( $$\sim$$ ∼ 3-log 10 reduction of the infective viral load, > 99.9% reduction). However, for the elastic strap of N95 respirators, a UV-C dose three times greater than that used in masks (1.4 J cm −2 per side) is required.

The selection of a suitable PCS in the context of make-to-order (MTO) is challenging, due to the characteristics of MTO businesses and the number of parameters or factors that comprise a PCS. The literature that compares PCSs in the MTO context reported contradictory results. In fact, there is a gap in the literature concerning which factors or parameters explain a PCS performance. This paper presents an analysis of comparative studies on PCS in the MTO context, using a systematic literature review, to reveal which control factors and manufacturing conditions influence a PCS performance. The analysis concentrates on studies that use simulation to assess the performance of PCSs. Our results indicate that the main difference in PCSs performance is the design of the control loops. Other important factors that must be considered in the choice of a PCS are the order release mechanism, the workload aggregation approach, and the workload estimation method used on control loops. A framework for choosing a suitable PCS for MTO companies is presented, considering these factors.","['Business and Management', 'Production', 'Manufacturing, Machines, Tools, Processes', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10845-020-01673-z
Article,doi:10.1186/s12913-022-07472-x,a qualitative system dynamics model for effects of workplace violence and clinician burnout on agitation management in the emergency department,BMC Health Services Research,10.1186/s12913-022-07472-x,BioMed Central,2022-01-15,"Abstract Background Over 1.7 million episodes of agitation occur annually across the United States in emergency departments (EDs), some of which lead to workplace assaults on clinicians and require invasive methods like physical restraints to maintain staff and patient safety. Recent studies demonstrated that experiences of workplace violence contribute to symptoms of burnout, which may impact future decisions regarding use of physical restraints on agitated patients. To capture the dynamic interactions between clinicians and agitated patients under their care, we applied qualitative system dynamics methods to develop a model that describes feedback mechanisms of clinician burnout and the use of physical restraints to manage agitation. Methods We convened an interprofessional panel of clinician stakeholders and agitation experts for a series of model building sessions to develop the current model. The panel derived the final version of our model over ten sessions of iterative refinement and modification, each lasting approximately three to four hours. We incorporated findings from prior studies on agitation and burnout related to workplace violence, identifying interpersonal and psychological factors likely to influence our outcomes of interest to form the basis of our model. Results The final model resulted in five main sets of feedback loops that describe key narratives regarding the relationship between clinician burnout and agitated patients becoming physically restrained: (1) use of restraints decreases agitation and risk of assault, leading to increased perceptions of safety and decreasing use of restraints in a balancing feedback loop which stabilizes the system; (2) clinician stress leads to a perception of decreased safety and lower threshold to restrain, causing more stress in a negatively reinforcing loop; (3) clinician burnout leads to a decreased perception of colleague support which leads to more burnout in a negatively reinforcing loop; (4) clinician burnout leads to negative perceptions of patient intent during agitation, thus lowering threshold to restrain and leading to higher task load, more likelihood of workplace assaults, and higher burnout in a negatively reinforcing loop; and (5) mutual trust between clinicians causes increased perceptions of safety and improved team control, leading to decreased clinician stress and further increased mutual trust in a positively reinforcing loop. Conclusions Our system dynamics approach led to the development of a robust qualitative model that illustrates a number of important feedback cycles that underly the relationships between clinician experiences of workplace violence, stress and burnout, and impact on decisions to physically restrain agitated patients. This work identifies potential opportunities at multiple targets to break negatively reinforcing cycles and support positive influences on safety for both clinicians and patients in the face of physical danger.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Public Health', 'Health Administration', 'Health Informatics', 'Nursing Research']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07472-x

Nonetheless, most classification models are evaluated primarily on a performance level, where XAI requires striking a balance between either simple models (e.g. linear regression) or models using complex inference structures (e.g. neural networks) with post-processing to calculate feature importance. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of predictive models with varying intrinsic complexity are measured based on explainability with model-agnostic quantitative evaluation metrics. To this end, explainability is designed as a symbiosis between interpretability and faithfulness and thereby allowing to compare inherently created explanations (e.g. decision tree rules) with post-hoc explainability techniques (e.g. Shapley values) on top of AI models. Moreover, two improved versions of the logistic regression model capable of capturing non-linear interactions and both inherently generating their own explanations are proposed in the OOPPM context. These models are benchmarked with two common state-of-the-art models with post-hoc explanation techniques in the explainability-performance space.","['Computer Science', 'Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery', 'Business Process Management', 'Computer Applications']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98581-3_15

Fine-tuning, traditionally used for this purpose, is an expensive procedure in terms of computation and memory. Dramatic growth of PLM capacities has led to the emergence of zero- and few-shot methods, which use natural language to describe tasks. Although these methods do not modify the parameters of the model, they rely on manual prompt design, which may be suboptimal. To address this issue, a range of techniques for automatic prompt search have been proposed recently. In this paper, we present a framework for continuous prompt tuning (CPT) in Russian. We evaluated our framework by adapting RuGPT3 to tasks in the Russian benchmark SuperGLUE. We obtained metrics better or comparable to fine-tuning, while training only an auxiliary model that provides prompt embeddings, so the total number of trained parameters accounts for less than 0.4% of that of RuGPT3. In addition, we conducted experiments comparing different configurations of the framework and explored the lower bound to which we can reduce the number of parameters.

The aims of this work are to characterize the current state of simulation-based education in the health sciences, to determine the structure of Latin American simulation centers in terms of teaching, research, and continuing medical education (CME), as well as to determine the perception of quality based on international standards of simulation practices for the directors of Latin American centers. Methods A quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study with a demographic questionnaire and a Likert-type survey was conducted to the directors of the simulation centers found in Latin America. Results Four hundred eight simulation centers were documented, the survey was answered by 240 directors, and the data from 149 were complete responses on the 42 quality self-perception scale and considered valid on further analyses related to the quality of the programs. Most of the centers that responded correspond to Chile, Brazil, and Mexico (37.5%, 18.1%, 12.7%). 84% of the centers are university-based, and 71% of the centers are medium-sized, with less than 10 instructors (54%). The directors are mostly women (61.7%), medical doctors (50%), and nurses (40%), with clinical specialization (37%), master’s degree (53%), and doctorate (13%). 75% have completed a simulation instructor course, and 6% have developed a fellowship.

In the court of law, fingerprint-proof is undeniably the most dependable and acceptable evidence to date. Fingerprint designs are exclusive in each human and the chance of two individuals having identical fingerprints is an exceptional case about one in sixty-four thousand million also the fingerprint minutiae patterns of the undistinguishable twins are different, and the ridge pattern of each fingertip remain unchanged from birth to till death. Fingerprints can be divided into basic four categories i.e. Loop, whorl, arch, and composites, nevertheless, there are more than 100 interleaved ridge and valleys physiognomies, called Galton’s details, in a single rolled fingerprint. Due to the immense potential of fingerprints as an effective method of identification, the present research paper tries to investigate the problem of blood group identification and analysis of diseases those arises with aging like hypertension, type 2-diabetes and arthritis from a fingerprint by analyzing their patterns correlation with blood group and age of an individual. The work has been driven by studies of anthropometry, biometric trademark, and pattern recognition proposing that it is possible to predict blood group using fingerprint map reading. Dermatoglyphics as a diagnostic aid used from ancient eras and now it is well established in number of diseases which have strong hereditary basis and is employed as a method for screening for abnormal anomalies. Apart from its use in predicting the diagnosis of disease; dermatoglyphics is also used in forensic medicine in individual identification, physical anthropology, human genetics and medicine. However, the Machine and Deep Learning techniques, if used for fingerprint minutiae patterns to be trained by Neural Network for blood group prediction and classification of common clinical diseases arises with aging based on lifestyle would be an unusual research work.","['Computer Science', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computer Science, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-020-09891-w

The main advantages of these cells are flexibility and easy handling/implementation, and the aesthetics of the built environment can also be favored. This paper intends to evaluate the thermal performance of organic cells from the images captured by an infrared camera. The results showed that climatic and environmental conditions have a significant role in the performance of these cells, and that they have an almost instantaneous cooling capacity, based on the reduction of the solar incidence in these cells. As per the captured thermographic images, it is observed that the organic PV cells operate at temperatures higher than those determined in norms and standardizations performed with a focus on the performance of photovoltaic modules.","['Engineering', 'Communications Engineering, Networks', 'Innovation/Technology Management']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75680-2_90

The concept has been established over the last four years in a unique collaboration of 41 laboratories within a Horizon 2020 design study funded by the European Union. EuPRAXIA is the first European project that develops a dedicated particle accelerator research infrastructure based on novel plasma acceleration concepts and laser technology. It focuses on the development of electron accelerators and underlying technologies, their user communities, and the exploitation of existing accelerator infrastructures in Europe. EuPRAXIA has involved, amongst others, the international laser community and industry to build links and bridges with accelerator science — through realising synergies, identifying disruptive ideas, innovating, and fostering knowledge exchange. The Eu-PRAXIA project aims at the construction of an innovative electron accelerator using laser- and electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration that offers a significant reduction in size and possible savings in cost over current state-of-the-art radiofrequency-based accelerators. The foreseen electron energy range of one to five gigaelectronvolts (GeV) and its performance goals will enable versatile applications in various domains, e.g. as a compact free-electron laser (FEL), compact sources for medical imaging and positron generation, table-top test beams for particle detectors, as well as deeply penetrating X-ray and gamma-ray sources for material testing. EuPRAXIA is designed to be the required stepping stone to possible future plasma-based facilities, such as linear colliders at the high-energy physics (HEP) energy frontier. Consistent with a high-confidence approach, the project includes measures to retire risk by establishing scaled technology demonstrators. This report includes preliminary models for project implementation, cost and schedule that would allow operation of the full Eu-PRAXIA facility within 8—10 years.","['Physics', 'Condensed Matter Physics', 'Materials Science, general', 'Atomic, Molecular, Optical and Plasma Physics', 'Physics, general', 'Measurement Science and Instrumentation', 'Classical and Continuum Physics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2020-000127-8

Since knowledge about the causes and severity of technostress and about the strategies healthcare managers use to handle it is limited, the aim of this study was to describe their experience of technostress and the actions they employ to address it. Methods An explorative design based on the critical incident technique was used. In total, 20 healthcare managers (10 women, 10 men) from four hospitals in two county councils in Sweden were purposively selected according to professional background, hierarchical management position, control span, time in the management position, and sex. Semi-structured interviews with regard to critical incidents and actions taken to handle technostress were conducted. Results Healthcare managers’ experiences of technostress ( n  = 279) were categorised related to three main areas. These involved ‘negative aspects of digital communication’ (e.g. high workload, invasion of private life, and negative feelings related to digital communication), ‘poor user experience of ICT systems (such as illogicality of the ICT system, time-consuming ICT system, or malfunctioning ICT system) and ‘needs to improve organisational resources’ (e.g. needs associated with digital literacy, user influence and distribution of work and ICT systems). Actions taken to handle technostress ( n =196) were described relating to three main areas involving ‘culture, norms and social support’ (such as good email culture, and co-worker support), ‘individual resources’ (e.g. individual strategies and competence) and ‘organisational resources’ (such as IT-related assistance and support). Conclusions Healthcare managers described negative aspects of digital communication, poor user experience of ICT systems, and lack of organisational resources as potential technostress creators. These problems were handled by taking action related to culture, norms and social support, and individual as well as organisational resources. All these features, along with consideration of healthcare managers’ job demands and resources in general, should be incorporated into actions monitored by healthcare organisations to improve or maintain a sustainable digitalised environment for healthcare managers.

The hybrid method features an accurate estimation of structural loads (such as bending moments, shear forces, and torsional moments) due to maneuvers and gusts even for high load events and can be set up for a given flight test database in shortest time. Therefore, the hybrid method provides a cost-efficient setup of an accurate aircraft loads monitoring system.

The contextual complexities inherent in ‘wicked’ problems mean that solutions warrant a systems approach that encompasses innovation and new ways of thinking about, facilitating and implementing collective decision-making processes and change practices. Innovation platforms are a mechanism for facilitating communication and collaboration among diverse stakeholders, promoting joint action and stimulating innovation. Developmental evaluation is an approach that is increasingly being used to evaluate innovative and emergent programmes and projects, as it enables evaluators to provide real-time feedback so that evaluation findings can be used to guide development and adaptations. Developmental evaluation emphasises learning and adaptation, and aligns well with the implementation of innovation platforms that have continuous reflection, learning and adaptation as a specific design principle. Here, we outline our rationale for applying a developmental evaluation to enhance the formation, functioning and outcomes of an innovation platform aimed at accelerating and strengthening large-scale quality improvement efforts in Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary healthcare. We provide examples to explain how the developmental evaluation findings were used for adaptation of the innovation platform and assess to what extent our application of developmental evaluation was consistent with, and reflective of, its essential principles. Our evaluation aligned strongly with the principles of developmental evaluation, and the approach we took was well suited to situations with a developmental purpose, innovation niche and complexity such as innovation platforms. As a result, along with the increasing interest in multi-stakeholder platforms (e.g. innovation platforms) and the inherent challenges with evaluating these complex networks, we anticipate our use of this approach being of interest globally.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Health Administration', 'R & D/Technology Policy', 'Medicine/Public Health, general', 'Health Services Research', 'Public Health', 'Health Policy']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00562-4

The traffic flow has stochastic nature and nonlinear dynamics which make accurate prediction of traffic flow a challenging process. In most existing methods, the nonlinear and stochastic qualities of traffic flow have not been taken into consideration simultaneously and these methods do not possess satisfactory accuracy either. In this paper, in order to reduce the prediction error based on traffic flow characteristics, we applied two different methods. At first, we applied a locally linear neuro-fuzzy method using local linear model tree learning algorithm for nonlinear identification of traffic flow. Then, to eliminate the noisy components and also to increase the prediction accuracy, we proposed a method, which is the combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and locally linear neuro-fuzzy model (LLNF). In this method, firstly, the principal components of the traffic flow time series were extracted, several noisy and unimportant components were thrown out and then every remained important component was modeled by using a LLNF network, the trained networks were utilized for one-step-ahead prediction, and finally the predicted patterns were combined to construct the general prediction. Moreover, we compared the results of these two methods with each other and also with those of several other intelligent methods such as multi-layer perceptron, radial-basis function, network and adaptive network fuzzy inference system. The simulation results revealed that the proposed SSA + LLNF approach for traffic flow prediction had promising and superior performance.","['Engineering', 'Electrical Engineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40998-019-00227-1

Evolutionary biology has a critical role to play in how we respond. The problem fundamentally involves two evolvable variables: Ecosystems , which we depend on for survival; and Us , who have the capacity to alter those ecosystems in a way that threatens our survival. Ecosystems are complex higher-order metabolic systems, closed-loop networks of interacting inheritance systems each with their own capacities for exploiting and exploring their surroundings. Collectively, this gives rise to an Evolutionary Commons , an emergent property of ecosystems that acts as a storehouse of potential that can be unleashed when the conditions change. Evolutionary potential is what makes ecosystems robust, relatively immune to the fate of any given inheritance system, without losing the ability to break apart and reform when disturbed in proportion to the capacities for ecological fitting of their constituent members. Putting evolution to work for humanity is about recognizing that the fundamental resource in the biosphere for coping with change is the potential stored in the evolutionary commons. For our own well-being, our economic policies and strategies should reflect this. To persist indefinitely, we must preserve the biosphere, and to do this we must preserve as many elements of the evolutionary process as possible. Darwinism Then and Now is fundamentally a story about coping with change by changing. Evolution is the only way the biosphere has coped with global climate change before, and the only way it will do it again. To sustain ourselves, we must exploit the biosphere without destroying the evolutionary potential to explore. We propose the Four Laws of Biotics to guide our efforts and discuss how they inform efforts in conservation biology, coping with emerging diseases, the circular economy, and the economics of well-being.","['Life Sciences', 'Evolutionary Biology', 'History of Biology', 'Philosophy of Science']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52086-1_11

Article,doi:10.1186/s12913-019-4312-x,assessing receptiveness to change among primary healthcare providers by adopting the consolidated framework for implementation research (cfir),BMC Health Services Research,10.1186/s12913-019-4312-x,BioMed Central,2019-07-16,"Background Amid the current burden of non-communicable (NCD) diseases in Malaysia, there is a growing demand for more efficient service delivery of primary healthcare. A complex intervention is proposed to improve NCD management in Malaysia. This exploratory study aimed to assess primary healthcare providers’ receptiveness towards change prior to implementation of the proposed complex intervention. Method This study was conducted using an exploratory qualitative approach on purposely selected healthcare providers at primary healthcare clinics. Twenty focus group discussions and three in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Consent was obtained prior to interviews and for audio-recordings. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed, guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), a framework comprised of five major domains promoting implementation theory development and verification across multiple contexts. Results The study revealed via CFIR that most primary healthcare providers were receptive towards any proposed changes or intervention for the betterment of NCD care management. However, many challenges were outlined across four CFIR domains—intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, and individual characteristics—that included perceived barriers to implementation. Perception of issues that triggered proposed changes reflected the current situation, including existing facilitating aspects that can support the implementation of any future intervention. The importance of strengthening the primary healthcare delivery system was also expressed. Conclusion Understanding existing situations faced at the primary healthcare setting is imperative prior to implementation of any intervention. Healthcare providers’ receptiveness to change was explored, and using CFIR framework, challenges or perceived barriers among healthcare providers were identified. CFIR was able to outline the clinics’ setting, individual behaviour and external agency factors that have direct impact to the organisation. These are important indicators in ensuring feasibility, effectiveness and sustainability of any intervention, as well as future scalability considerations.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Public Health', 'Health Administration', 'Health Informatics', 'Nursing Research']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4312-x

In this paper, three artificial intelligence techniques, namely the local linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) technique, artificial neural network (ANN) and the hybrid cuckoo optimization algorithm-artificial neural network (COA-ANN), were used to estimate the uniaxial compressive strength and the static Young’s modulus of limestone. For this purpose, 115 limestone samples were subjected to the tests of uniaxial compressive strength, ultrasonic velocity, and physical properties (density and porosity) tests. From the laboratory results obtained, the values of the P-wave velocity, density, porosity and dynamic Poisson’s ratio were tested as the model input parameters to determine the best input configuration for estimating the uniaxial compressive strength and the static Young’s modulus. Different models with different input combinations were practiced, and the models with the highest estimation accuracy are reported here. Performance evaluation was carried out using three criteria including coefficient of determination, variance accounted for, and normalized mean-square error. Evaluating the correlation coefficients and error criteria resulting from the three methods used demonstrates the superiority of LLNF method to ANN and COA-ANN methods. The developed ANN models display lower correlation coefficients and higher amount of error compared to the other models. However, using cuckoo optimization algorithm has led to significant improvement in accuracy and precision of estimations carried out by ANN and has improved its efficiency. Results have confirmed that the employed hybrid method outperforms in estimating untrained data (test data) compared to the LLNF and ANN methods.","['Earth Sciences', 'Mineral Resources', 'Fossil Fuels (incl.

Several GWR issues are highlighted in this chapter. The overly academic education system is accused of being one of the main causes, as it does not sufficiently prepare fresh graduates for a smooth entry into the work environment. A survey of employers and educational institutions revealed that fresh graduates have more intellectual and meta skills as opposed to personality and job-specific skills. Despite genuine endeavours from stakeholders (government/regulatory bodies, educational institutions and employers), the results are still mixed. The lack of synergy between the three main stakeholders appears to a major constraint to successful graduate work-readiness initiatives. Nonetheless, some initiatives have had a positive impact.","['Business and Management', 'Human Resource Development', 'Higher Education', 'Educational Policy and Politics', 'Career Skills']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0974-8_9

Peer-to-peer platforms and drivers of (non)participation within the context of the UK’s second-hand luxury market are currently under-researched. This chapter is exploratory in nature and utilises a qualitative research approach. This study conducts semi-structured interviews with consumers from varied demographical backgrounds to gain an insight into consumers’ perceptions of access-based consumption and sustainability. Findings identified drivers of (non)participation and the emergences of a (potentially) new micro-entrepreneur. It is further explored whether this would be a feasible business model for the future with consumers actively buying into the access-based concept. Although findings cannot be generalised, the data provides thinking points for future research and investigates an economically significant context. Gaining an insight into this newly emerging trend could help retailers to capitalise on disruptive innovations and change consumer perceptions of partaking in access-based consumption. Thus far, drivers of (non)participation in the context of the UK’s second-hand luxury industry remain under-researched, and the economic significance of the sector indicates the necessity of this research.","['Environment', 'Sustainable Development', 'Supply Chain Management', 'Engineering Design', 'Environmental Management', 'Industrial and Production Engineering', 'Textile Engineering']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0623-5_3

In many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components – time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation – and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.","['Medicine & Public Health', 'Health Informatics', 'Health Informatics', 'Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10916-018-1085-4

These search algorithms opt the solution that minimizes a specific cost function. In language models, perplexity is one of the most popular cost functions. In this study, we propose a fractional nonlinear programming model that finds the optimal perplexity value. The special structure of the model allows us to approximate it by a linear programming model that can be solved using the well-known simplex algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use optimization techniques to find perplexity values in the language modeling literature. We apply our model to find hyperparameters of a language model and compare it to the grid search algorithm. Furthermore, we illustrate that it results in lower perplexity values. We perform this experiment on a real-world dataset from SwiftKey to validate our proposed approach.","['Computer Science', 'Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters', 'Processor Architectures', 'Computer Science, general']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-018-2236-6

For PbD to be a viable option, it is important to understand developers’ perceptions, interpretation and practices as to informational privacy (or data protection). To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 27 developers from different domains, who practice software design. Grounded analysis of the data revealed an interplay between several different forces affecting the way in which developers handle privacy concerns. Borrowing the schema of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we classified and analyzed the cognitive, organizational and behavioral factors that play a role in developers’ privacy decision making. Our findings indicate that developers use the vocabulary of data security to approach privacy challenges, and that this vocabulary limits their perceptions of privacy mainly to third-party threats coming from outside of the organization; that organizational privacy climate is a powerful means for organizations to guide developers toward particular practices of privacy; and that software architectural patterns frame privacy solutions that are used throughout the development process, possibly explaining developers’ preference of policy-based solutions to architectural solutions. Further, we show, through the use of the SCT schema for framing the findings of this study, how a theoretical model of the factors that influence developers’ privacy practices can be conceptualized and used as a guide for future research toward effective implementation of PbD.","['Computer Science', 'Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems', 'Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-017-9517-1

Broadly speaking, this capability is called resilience. Resilience means different things in different domains (e.g., military, space, healthcare, energy). For example, in the military domain, resilience is defined as the ability of a system to adapt affordably and perform effectively across a wide range of operational contexts, where context is defined by mission, environment, threat, and force disposition [1]. In the healthcare domain, resilience depends on the magnitude and duration of the disruption (e.g., surge in patients). A short-term surge can be handled by people working overtime. A long-term surge is viewed as a trend and requires a more permanent response such as increase in personnel and capacity of facilities. A key issue in engineering resilient systems is the lengthy and costly upfront engineering process. As important, current approaches to resilient system design rely on ad hoc methods (e.g., safety nets) and piecemeal solutions when developing mechanisms to respond to disruptions and unanticipated system behaviors [3, 4]. In such approaches, observed high-level behaviors are compared to expected high-level behaviors. When the difference exceeds a certain threshold, the observed behavior is considered a problem, or a precursor to a problem. Such behaviors trigger a transition to a known safe state until the underlying problem is diagnosed and resolved. During the problem resolution, the system remains unusable. Furthermore, existing methods do not take into account the different states and modes of complex systems, nor do they address unprecedented disruptions that can occur at arbitrary times during complex system operation. They also do not address the time-dependent nature of disruptions and their impact on complex systems. In light of the foregoing, there is a pressing need for an overarching methodology for developing resilient systems, one that is preferably rooted in formal modeling approaches. The ideal formal modeling approach is one that has sufficient flexibility in its formalisms to accommodate uncertainty in system states that arise from partial observability of system behavior and unexpected disruptions. The models should also lend themselves to formal verification, and testing. And finally, the models should be able to learn from observations. To advance beyond the state of the art in model-based approaches, we need the ability to determine desired appropriate behaviors of complex systems. This is a challenge because a complex system invariably has a large state space, with some “hidden” states arising from complex interactions between the system elements and between the system and the environment. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that the state of the system is often not known because of partial observability of the system and environmental uncertainties. Additional complicating factors include incomplete understanding of system dependencies and environmental influences, likelihood of conflicts between local and global responses, and an increase in the number and types of human roles.","['Engineering', 'Engineering Design', 'Control, Robotics, Mechatronics', 'Quality Control, Reliability, Safety and Risk', 'Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing', 'Operating Procedures, Materials Treatment']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62184-5_9

An extensive literature review has been conducted to identify a variety of relevant definitions for CSR CSR , including international and South African definitions. These definitions were analysed through qualitative content analysis Content Analysis , in an inductive manner. The main principles of both international and South African definitions were identified, after which these principles were compared in order to draw conclusions regarding the differences and similarities thereof. There are a number of common principles which can be found in the majority of definitions for CSR CSR , even though there are slight differences in nuances. The principles of CSR CSR in South Africa are in line with those of international definitions, but additional principles are identified, all of which can be linked to the country’s history of apartheid and its current attempts to correct the wrongs of the past. The paper suggests that for CSR CSR initiatives to be relevant in different countries, the definition thereof should be formulated taking the unique issues and context of a particular country into account. Therefore, although there are a number of widely accepted principles for CSR CSR which should be honoured, there cannot be one universally accepted definition for CSR CSR . This paper highlights the communalities among seemingly different definitions of CSR CSR , narrowing it down to a number of basic principles. It further illustrates how the CSR CSR agenda in South Africa differs from the international conceptualization thereof and suggests a clearer and more unified approach to conceptualizing and defining CSR CSR within the South African context, to further reflect the unique history and issues of the country. It is suggested that CSR CSR definitions should be contextual and reflect the uniqueness of different countries.","['Business and Management', 'Business Ethics', 'Corporate Governance', 'Macroeconomics/Monetary Economics//Financial Economics']",springer,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence'),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-3212-7_14
