10.1109/SPICSCON54707.2021.9885722,a framework of metaverse for systems engineering,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently the Metaverse has received enormous attention around the world. The advanced metaverse will be a more realistic environment with greater specific and subtle interconnections, with less race, gender, and even physical impairment, all of which would be immensely helpful to society. However, metaverse is still in its infancy, with a lot of room for improvement. The industry has already begun to prepare for the metaverse’s enormous potential, supported by frenzied investment, yet there are few talks on metaverse in academia to scientifically lead its growth. In this paper, we present a metaverse design that adopts a global approach to technology, communication, and the environment. We propose an AI-driven metaverse model that might be deployed to realize the promise of model-based systems engineering in the near future. Finally, we offer research questions that should be taken up by academia to further the metaverse.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9885722/,"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Information, Communication & Systems (SPICSCON)",3-4 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

However, the complexity of and probabilistic nature in the underlying methods enabling such capabilities present challenges for current systems engineering processes for assurance, and test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEVV). This paper provides a preliminary attempt to map recently developed technical approaches in the assurance and TEVV of learning enabled autonomous systems (LEAS) literature to a traditional systems engineering v-model. This mapping categorizes such techniques into three main approaches: development, acquisition, and sustainment. This mapping reviews the latest techniques to develop safe, reliable, and resilient learning enabled autonomous systems, without recommending radical and impractical changes to existing systems engineering processes.

Cybersecurity is about the prevention or mitigation of malicious acts undertaken to either compromise systems directly or access valuable information that could be subject to criminal misuse. The cybersecurity of Communication, Navigation, and surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) systems is aimed at controlling the effects of such threats and enhancing the safety of flying passengers. Besides, the cybers resilience of state-of-the-art CNS/ATM and avionics systems have been impacted by convoluted risk management issues. The security of legacy aviation and airport infrastructure has been curtailed owing to their annexure to public networks, which constitute a significant risk to the aviation industry and the general public as a whole. The existing control mechanisms in place, with the aim of assuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of information, have a multitude of deficiencies in deciding the extent of vulnerability of systems, the severity of impact and subsequently overall risk rating. Weaknesses in some of the security controls which are intended to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks also contribute towards this issue. A risk-based system engineering solution is envisioned in managing today's cyber-physical systems which may comprise of interwound Systems of Systems (SoS).

An SoS requires communication and collaboration between otherwise independently operating systems, which are subject to different standards, changing conditions, and hidden assumptions. Thus, interoperability approaches that are based on standardization and symbolic inference will have limited generalization and scalability in the SoS engineering domain. We present simulation experiments performed with message data generated using heating and ventilation system simulations. While the unsupervised learning approach proposed here remains unsolved in general, we obtained up to 75% translation accuracy with autoencoders aligned by back-translation after investigating seven different models with different training protocols and hyperparameters. For comparison, we obtain 100% translation accuracy on the same task with supervised learning, but the need for a labeled dataset makes that approach less interesting.

10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773890,creating a digital twin of an insider threat detection enterprise using model-based systems engineering,IEEE,Conferences,"Inference Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is a methodology developed to address test and evaluation limitations that insider threat detection enterprises face due to a lack of ground truth and/or missing data. IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions.

This type of development requires a high degree of collaboration, communication, and orchestration. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) supports engineers in the interdisciplinary development of future systems. MBSE uses models to generate a unified and complete view of the system. This allows changes to be easily tracked and the visualization helps to understand the system discipline-independent. The creation of these models still requires high effort.

10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773875,identifying ai opportunities in donor kidney acceptance: incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The current organ placement process for transplantation is an evolving system of systems with emergent behavior. This highly integrated complex system consists of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), Transplant Centers (TXC), patients, and their interactions. The number of waitlisted kidney candidates is nearly five times the available supply. Unfortunately, over twenty percent of donated deceased donor kidneys (supply) are discarded due to issues with kidney quality. While some of this discard is medically necessary, some represent a lost opportunity. One approach is to develop a decision support system to identify the right candidate for the right donor at the right time and then communicate that analysis to various stakeholders in different locations over time. This paper uses an incremental hierarchical systems engineering approach to capture the current kidney allocation systems architecture and identify opportunities for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system to reduce kidney discard. The incremental hierarchical (top to bottom) approach was combined with model-based system engineering (MBSE) to aid in eliciting stakeholders’ needs, behaviors, boundaries, and interactions. This approach led to a structured development process for the attractor “reducing kidney discard” and facilitated systematically documenting the opportunity space. Stakeholders reviewed proposed AI decision support systems, ensuring that decision points with more significant opportunities were addressed. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach is justified with a data-driven deep learning TXC decision support system validated by transplant surgeons.

While interfaces in CPS systems might be generic, the data that is produced for custom application needs has to be transformed and merged in very specific ways, to allow systems engineers proper interpretation and insight-extraction. In order to enable efficient cooperation between systems engineers and data scientists, the systems engineers have to provide a fine-grained specification that (a) describes all parts of the CPS, (b) how they might interact, (c) what data is exchanged between them, and (d) how the data inter-relates. A data scientists can then iteratively (including further refinements of the specification) prepare the necessary custom machine-learning models and components. Therefore, this work introduces a method supporting the collaborative definition of machine learning tasks by leveraging model-based systems engineering in the formalization of the systems modeling language SysML. The method supports the identification and integration of various data sources, the required definition of semantic connections between data attributes and the definition of the data processing steps within the machine learning support.

For some models, this purpose as well as the model itself might change over time. New interactions with the target system can occur and new details are added over time. Both have to be integrated immediately into the development procedure. When models are not maintained up to date and not used by different stakeholders, the benefits of the model-based approach are lessened due to the effort for generation and maintenance.

Encompassing domain-related vocabularies, concepts, concept hierarchy, along with the properties and relationships, domain ontologies are becoming a promising medium for knowledge sharing and exchange. With the emergence of the semantic web and big data, learning domain ontologies from text is becoming a cutting-edge technique as it is an automatic process of deriving ontological knowledge. Specifically, a set of representative concepts and semantic relations can be rapidly derived from unstructured text documents in a hierarchical structure to model a domain. In this paper, we aim at exploiting the ontology learning approach to extract a domain ontology from systems engineering handbooks. An approach is proposed for learning terms, concepts, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations. By incorporating both linguistic-based and statistical-based natural language processing techniques, we realized an automatic detection of complex domain terms and conceptualized the systems engineering body of knowledge in a semantic fashion. To evaluate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted, wherein the hybrid approach is applied with template-driven and machine learning algorithms.

10.1109/DEXA.2005.137,model-based self-managing systems engineering,IEEE,Conferences,"For many years, the vision of smart computing where systems can function and/or manage themselves independently from human intervention has provided numerous theoretical challenges to research communities ranging from intelligent systems and cybernetics to AI communities. These research trends have now been further fuelled by the IBM autonomic computing initiative, where biologically inspired concepts inform the development of systems that can adapt autonomously to their users’ requirements and environments. This paper considers the extent to which well-established general systems concepts might be valuable in the design of autonomic systems. The main two approaches considered are Checkland’s Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and Beer’s Viable Systems Model (VSM). The paper summarizes the relevant aspects of each approach and demonstrates their potential through the provision of an illustrative case study. Moreover, the paper illustrates how SSM and VSM approaches facilitate autonomic systems engineering by the capture of functional and non-functional application requirements such as lifetime self-management policies and operational tolerances.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1508263/,16th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA'05),22-26 Aug. 2005,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

For educators, teaching such a vast and dynamic field is both a necessity and a challenge. IoT-relevant topics such as programming, hardware, networking and artificial intelligence are already covered in core computing curricula. Does this mean that fresh graduates are well prepared to tackle complex IoT problems? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is that IoT devices are complex systems, where software, hardware, and humans interact with each other. From this interaction, unique behavior and hazardous situations can emerge that might easily stay undetected, unless systems are analyzed as a whole. This paper presents two differently flavored courses that teach IoT using a holistic, system-centric approach. The first is a broad introduction to Pervasive Computing, focused on the intelligence of ""Things"". The second is an advanced course that zooms on the process of testing a software-intensive system. The key characteristics of our approach are : (1) teaching only the bare essentials (topics needed for end-to-end engineering of a smart system), (2) a strong, hands-on project component, using microcontroller-based miniature systems, inspired by real-life, and (3) a rich partnership with industry and academic idea incubators.

Meanwhile, modern communication and information technologies have provided greater possibilities for socio-economic sectors to execute smarter decisions, and these technologies may advance the industrial application of SoSE. Therefore, targeting the rareness of government-oriented intelligent decision support system (DSS), and guided by the underlying system of systems thinking, this paper proposes a technical framework for designing a policy maker-responsive smart information system which focuses: (1) system of systems structural architecting; (2) geographical simulation using time-series remotely sensed data, GIS instrument and simulation bodies such as cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS); (3) SoS evolution description through network analysis and intelligent computing; (4) measurement of SoS effectiveness with two-tier and four-grade method; and (5) SoSE program for industrial optimization. Its application in tourism analysis will provide a smarter base for industrial policy-making, planning and forecasting, and will help reduce risk and cost in industrial restructuring.

Checking consistency between different models requires model data to be exchanged in some form between the modeling tools. However, in industrial practice such models can contain confidential data that must not be revealed to unauthorized parties, e.g., other departments or external companies. Therefore, it is a critical problem when the consistency management tool does not respect this. We found that none of the current multi-model consistency management approaches in literature consider this problem and provide suit-able protections to prevent possible confidential data theft caused by consistency checking. Hence, we propose an approach and implementation for confidentiality preservation in multi-model inconsistency detection that does not reveal confidential model data to unauthorized parties and increases the trustworthiness of the consistency checking process regarding data confidentiality.

This entails the introduction of data-driven workflows and data-management as new aspects of Automotive Systems Engineering (ASE). Tasks related to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software differ from their classical engineering and programming counterparts.

Based on five engineering management aspects, including design objectives, system boundaries, architecting and modeling, predictability and emergence, and learning and adaptation, a case study representing future CoIS illustrates how these five aspects, as well as their relationship to criticality and generativity, emerge as AI becomes an integrated part of the system. The findings imply that a future combined perspective on allowing generativity and maintaining or enhancing criticality is necessary, and notably, the results suggest that the understanding of system integrators and CoPS management partly fundamentally alters and partly is complemented with the emergence of CoIS. CoIS puts learning and adaptation characteristics in the foreground, i.e., CoIS are associated with increasingly generative design objectives, fluid system boundaries, new architecting and modeling approaches, and challenges predictability. The notion of bounded generativity is suggested to emphasize the combination of generativity and criticality as a direction for transforming engineering management in CoPS contexts and demands new approaches for designing future CoIS and safeguard its important societal functions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115278/,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2024,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

MBSE empowers the formalism of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation, specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the modeling languages and techniques are heterogeneous, even within the same enterprise system, which leads to difficulties for data interoperability. The discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information exchange among MBSE models more difficult, resulting in considerable information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. Therefore, this article presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects, points, properties, roles, and relationships with extensions (GOPPRRE), providing metamodels that support the various MBSE formalisms across lifecycle stages. In particular, knowledge graph models are developed to support unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover, the GOPPRRE ontologies are used to create the MBSE formalisms in a domain-specific modeling tool, MetaGraph, for evaluating its availability.

The details of how these multiple scales of organization in the brain influence one another and produce a multitude of human behaviors remains a clouded mystery. Mathematical, computational, and experimental neuroscientists employ a variety of cutting-edge methods, techniques, and algorithms in both humans and animals to identify the core mechanisms that govern the perception and action characteristics of the human brain. Integration of functional MRI (fMRI)–as an indirect measure of brain activity-with electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) as direct measures of spatiotemporal and spectral fingerprints of brain dynamics has provided novel insights into how the human brain operates in the resting state and in goal-oriented task performance. The ultimate goal is to identify the fundamental mechanisms that explain brain function across multiple spatiotemporal dynamics. Although our knowledge has grown exponentially in the past few decades, the integration of this knowledge to provide a conceptual framework of emergent behavior and pattern formation occurring on different levels of spatial organization remains challenging.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8672803/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,March 2019,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9328223/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",April 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

Emerging distributed CPSs integrate a wide range of heterogeneous aspects such as physical dynamics, control, machine learning, and error handling. Furthermore, system components are often distributed over multiple physical locations, hardware platforms, and communication networks. While model-based design (MBD) has tremendously improved the design process, CPS design remains a difficult task. Models are meant to improve understanding of a system, yet this quality is often lost when models become too complicated. In this paper, we show how to use aspect-oriented (AO) modeling techniques in MBD as a systematic way to segregate domains of expertise and cross-cutting concerns within the model. We demonstrate these concepts on actor-oriented models of an industrial robotic swarm application and illustrate the use of AO modeling techniques to manage the complexity.

Five human-autonomy teaming forms were proposed firstly, including fully human control, mostly human control & partially autonomy control, human-autonomy negotiation, mostly autonomy control & partially human control, and fully autonomy control. Correspondingly, five levels of human-autonomy interaction were defined, ranging from Ll to L5. Then, four conceptual architectures of human-autonomy teaming were constructed, denoting traded control, executive control, combined control, and supervisory control. Finally, human-autonomy teaming was instantiated based on the systematic approaches in systems engineering. Use case analysis was carried out to sketch the components and their interactions in a typical form of human-autonomy teaming.

Thus, security and safety (S&S) issues should be taken into account with functional design as early as possible during the developing process. However, it's rare to see ""one-size-fits-all"" modeling language and/or design tool. One way to solve this issue is to integrate different nature models into one model system, but this requires a unified semantic among modeling languages. We explore a model-based approach for systems engineering that facilitates the composition of several heterogeneous artifacts (called views) into a sound and consistent system model. Rather than trying to extend either SysML or SysML-sec into more expressive languages to add the missing features, we extract proper subsets of both languages to build a view adequate for conducting a security and safety analysis of Capella (SysML-based) functional models.

RL approaches to automated penetration testing are actively being developed, but there is no consensus view on the representation of computer networks with which RL should be interacting. Moreover, there are significant open challenges to how those representations can be grounded to the real networks where RL solution methods are applied. This paper elaborates on representation and grounding using topic challenges of interacting with real networks in real-time, emulating realistic adversary behavior, and handling unstable, evolving networks. These challenges are both practical and mathematical, and they directly concern the reliability and dependability of penetration testing systems. This paper proposes a layered reference model to help organize related research and engineering efforts. The presented layered reference model contrasts traditional models of attack graph workflows because it is not scoped to a sequential, feed-forward generation and analysis process, but to broader aspects of lifecycle and continuous deployment.

As advanced algorithms, like artificial intelligence (AI), become more ubiquitous and affordable, some organizations are turning to such technical systems to strengthen their decision-making and, by extension, system-level performance. However, the degree to which AI and autonomous systems impact system-level performance is suboptimal because existing approaches generally ignore two critical design factors—the extent to which algorithmic systems relieve humans of knowledge work and are structurally encoded in the system's task and communication structures. The purposeful design and incorporation of non-human knowledge workers (NHKWs) into organizations are central to system of systems engineering; NHKWs are likely to impact system complexity, the attainment of stakeholder goals, and other system performance measures.

A good set of architectural artifacts are easy to manipulate in achieving the purpose of usage well. Systems engineering methodologies evolve to deal with SoS level problems. And DoD's JCIDS is a good example which demonstrates SoS level problems using the capability based assessment (CBA) methodology. However, the complexity of the architecture makes it difficult to develop and use the architectural artifacts. DoDAF states that it was established to guide the development of architectures and to satisfy the demands of a structured, repeatable method for evaluating the architecture. Despite its intention, much of the community felt that the core architecture data model(CADM) of DoDAF was too complex and the complexity causes unnecessary cost and risk, the architecting result has been received with weak and delayed acceptance. Additionally, the meeting of the envisioned goals have fallen short.

Lexical semantics has become increasingly important in many natural language applications, this approach to semantics is concerned with psychological facts associated with meaning of words and how these words can be connected in semantic relations to build ontologies that provide a shared vocabulary to model a specified domain. And represent a structural framework for organizing information across fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Semantic Web, systems engineering and information architecture. But current systems mainly concentrate on classification of semantic relations rather than to give solutions for how these relations can be created [14]. At the same time, systems that do provide methods for creating the relations tend to ignore the context in which the conceptual relationships occur. Furthermore, methods that address semantic (non-taxonomic) relations are yet to come up with widely accepted ways of enhancing the process of classifying and extracting semantic relations. In this research we will focus on the learning of semantic relations patterns between word meanings by taking into consideration the surrounding context in the general domain. We will first generate semantic patterns in domain independent environment depending on previous specific semantic information, and a set of input examples.

While this concept is still emerging, both regulators and vendors recognize that these apps can be as powerful as purpose-built medical devices, and they are struggling to understand the appropriate techniques to support risk assessment and safety claims. Before being approved for market, the reliability of medical devices is typically ascertained by performing one of a number of hardware-centric, reliability-focused analyses. However, these techniques are not a good fit for the combined hardware and software systems that are defined by MAP apps, nor is their emphasis on reliability appropriate when the end goal is safety. In this work, we tailor a modern, systems-based hazard analysis technique (STAMP / STPA) to the domain of MAP apps by leveraging our prior work in safety-critical systems engineering for medical software. We also build on our previously developed AADL-based language and tooling for the semi-formal modeling of MAP app architectures to provide a proof-of-concept tool that aids the transition between design and analysis.

Of particular interest in achieving this is the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The use of AI/ML within the aviation industry, however, poses significant challenges, particularly connected to safety, reliability and certifiability. This paper is about the OpenCAS, a collision avoidance system based on Feed-Forward Neural Networks.

Though aerospace engineering is a relatively young discipline, stakeholders in the field can rely on a vast body of knowledge and good practices for space systems design and architecting of space missions. These guidelines have been identified and refined over the years. However, the increase in size and complexity of applications in the aerospace discipline highlighted some gaps in this approach: first, the amount of available information is now very large and originates from multiple sources, often with diverse representations, and useful data for trade space analysis or analysis of all potential alternatives can be easily overlooked; second, the variety and complexity of the systems involved and of the different domains to be kept into account can generate unexpected interactions that cannot be easily identified; third, continuous advancements in the field of aerospace resulted in the development of new approaches and methodologies, for which a common knowledge database is not existing yet, thus requiring substantial effort upfront. To address these gaps and support both decision making in early stage of space systems design and increased automation in extraction of necessary data to feed working groups and analytical methodologies, we propose the training and use of Artificial Intelligence agents. These agents can be trained to recognize not only information coming from standardized representations, for example Model Based Systems Engineering diagrams, but also descriptions of systems and functionalities in plain English. This capability allows each agent to quantify the relevance of publications and documents to the query for which it is trained. At the same time, each agent can recognize potentially useful information in documents which are only loosely connected to the systems or functionalities on which the agent has been trained, and which would possibly be overlooked in a traditional literature review. The search for pertinent sources can be further refined using keywords, that let the user specify more details about the systems or functionality of interest, based on the intended use of the data. In this work we illustrate the use of Artificial Intelligent agents to sort space habitat subsystems into NASA Technology Roadmaps categories and to identify relevant sources of data for these subsystems. We demonstrate how the agents can support the retrieval of complex information required to feed existing System-of-Systems analytic tools and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172802/,2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2020,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system's current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today's systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle.

In MADM methods, each decision criterion is assigned a weight based on how important it is to the Decision-Makers (DMs), and a decision matrix is populated with values representing assessments of each alternative with respect to the decision criteria. MADM methods, therefore, are susceptible to subjectivity due to inherent bias in DM’s preferences where slight fluctuation in stated DM’s preference can drastically impact the outcome. In this paper, we propose a data-driven methodology with Machine Learning to improve the effectiveness of MADM methods by reducing DMs’ subjective biases resulting from criteria weights. In addition, the proposed methodology leverages Exploratory Data Analysis to better determine the type of criteria as cost or benefit, depending upon whether it positively or negatively affects the MADM outcome.

Those algorithms can effectively classify data as system indicators, network packets, and logs according to a model they infer during training. This way, they provide sophisticated means to conduct intrusion detection by suspecting anomalies due to attacks in the value of those features. Additionally, Meta-Learners as Bagging and Boosting build ensembles of homogeneous classifiers that are known to improve classification performance with positive impact on intrusion detection. On the other hand, it is not yet clear if ensembles of heterogeneous or diverse classifiers can build better intrusion detectors. To such extent, we first recap on n-version programming, k-out-of-m (k-o-o-m) systems and the role of diversity. Then, we present k-o-o-m systems of classifiers for intrusion detection, expanding on meta-learning and diversity measures to be applied to classifiers.

The number of data sources used for this purpose determines the dimensionality of the feature space for learning and can reach millions for medium-sized systems. Learning on a space with high dimensionality generally incurs high communication and computational costs for the learning process.

Evidence across the Services and industry has affirmed digital engineering is a critical practice necessary to support acquisition in an environment of increasing global challenges, dynamic threats, rapidly evolving technologies, and increasing life expectancy of our systems currently in operation. Digital engineering updates the systems engineering practices to take full advantage of computational technology, modeling, data analytics, and data sciences. The Department of Defense's vision for digital engineering is to modernize how the Department designs, develops, delivers, operates, and sustains systems, while continuing to practice systems engineering efficiently and effectively. Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way acquisition and engineering are performed across a wide range of government agencies, industries, and academia. As the Department of Defense (DoD) transitions to digital engineering, there is a need to develop and maintain an acquisition workforce and culture that is literate in model-based engineering, competent in digital engineering models, methods, processes, tools, and understands digital artifacts across the acquisition lifecycle. One of the critical steps that was identified to enable this digital transformation is the development of a competency model that can be used to modernize the workforce. This paper outlines the results after completion of Phase 1 of WRT-1006, which concluded in the initial release of the Digital Engineering Competency Framework (DECF) by SERC, and the initial Phase 2 efforts of implementing the framework as a benchmark for the content of a digital engineering training curriculum. The purpose of the DECF is to provide clear guidance for the DoD acquisition workforce, in particular the engineering acquisition workforce, through clearly defined competencies that illuminate the knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors required for digital engineering professionals. The approach taken to develop the DECF drew from existing competency models in fields neighboring digital engineering and from the feedback of experienced practicing digital engineering community. The initial version of the DECF v.1.0 was released as a key WRT1006 Phase 1 result with confidence in the maturity of the structure and general content. The overarching structure of the DECF v.1.0 consists of competency areas, proficiency levels within the competency, and constituting knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors (KSABs). Now that this benchmark is established, the second phase of our project involves the comparison of the DECF to the existing Defense Acquisition University (DAU) curriculum to determine what elements of such existing curriculum already support the competencies in the model.

Machine Learning (ML) approaches have recently been used in conceptual modeling to realize, among others, intelligent modeling assistance, model transformation, and metamodel classification. These works en-code models in various ways, making the encoded models suitable for applying ML algorithms. The encodings capture the models' structure and/or semantics, making this information available to the ML model during training. Therefore, the choice of the encoding for any ML-driven task is crucial for the ML model to learn the relevant contextual information. In this paper, we report findings from a systematic literature review which yields insights into the current research in machine learning for conceptual modeling (ML4CM). The review focuses on the various encodings used in existing ML4CM solutions and provides insights into i) which are the information sources, ii) how is the conceptual model's structure and/or semantics encoded, iii) why is the model encoded, i.e., for which conceptual modeling task and, iv) which ML algorithms are applied.

Though complexity in the industry is recognized, research methodology has generally been reductionist, and has not understood tourism as a monolithic meta-system composed of independent and contributive component systems. Therefore, interpretations of tourism development are highly focused and sector-specific, thus limiting understanding of the complex inter-component relationships, the emergent behavior in system evolution and the impact of different component on the overall industrial capacity. This paper explores system of systems (SoS) science as an alternative paradigm to analyze the industry, and suggests that intelligence approaches is required to realize the engineering of the system of systems' operation towards desired outcomes. The industrial analysis and policy making will benefit from a system of systems engineering (SoSE) program.

The nature of many of these Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches raises a number of additional, technology-specific assurance concerns. One such approach is the Bayesian Network (BN) probabilistic modelling framework. Bayesian Networks and the family of modelling techniques they belong to form the basis of many AI applications. However, little research has been conducted into the assurance of BN-based systems for use in safety-critical applications. This paper explores some of the key distinctions between BN-based software-intensive systems and conventional software systems.

This trend introduces a multitude of control parameters generally accompanied by high computational costs. The resulting complexity limits the applicability of AI in these domains. One solution to this problem is to focus on light-weight flexible AI architectures which can be simultaneously generated, controlled and run in parallel. The resulting systems should then be able to control individual game characters, scaling up to large numbers of characters, forming even complex social systems. Here we contribute one element of such a system: a light-weight systems-engineering approach for enriching behaviour arbitration in action selection. Our mechanism-ERGo-improves high-level goal arbitration in existing light-weight action selection mechanisms. ERGo provides easy and reliable non-deterministic control of goal switching, activation and inhibition, allowing natural behaviour maintenance. This mechanism can aid agent design in cases where static, linear, predefined priorities are undesirable. The model underlying our approach is biomimetic, based on neuro-cognitive research on the dopaminic cells responsible for controlling goal switching and maintenance in the mammalian brain. We demonstrate and evaluate our mechanism in a real-time, game-like simulation environment, using a previously-published system as a baseline for comparison.

To capture user intentions accurately, it is important to design efficient dialog strategy for guiding users to express their intentions by limited rounds of dialogue. However, intention acquisition methods based solely on semantics analysis do not work well especially for those complex user requirements/intentions. In this work, we design a conversational AI bot that could capture user intentions based on multimodal information including video, audio and texts. The bot could incorporate sentiments that are extracted from multimodal information into the bot's dialogue strategy. Sentiments are used for dynamically adjusting the questioning tactics during the dialogue. We design controlled experiments to explore the effectiveness of incorporating multimodal sentiments into the process of guiding users to expressing their intentions. Volunteers are asked to talk with the conversational AI Bot with rich emotions in real application scenarios. Experimental results show that our proposed approach could effectively improve the accuracy of user intention recognition and increase user satisfaction during dialogue.

The development of intelligent early-warning systems of dam safety (IEWSDS) is a significant approach to realize above aim. This paper regarded dam as a vital and intelligent system, thereby constructed a bionics model of dam safety, which consisted of sensing system (nerve), central processing unit (cerebrum) and decision-making implement (organism). With above model and systems engineering, this paper designed an IEWSDS, which was composed of integration control, intelligent inference machine, project database, model base, graphics base and input/output modules. In the system, metadata base based on object oriented data model was used to implement the integration of homogeneous or nonhomogeneous databases storing dam safety data from different information sources. The multilevel link style was adopted to manage model base. Intelligent inference machine is the central processing unit of IEWSDS implementing data analysis, abnormality diagnosis and evaluation for dam safety. Because of strong non-linear and dynamic characteristics, the system adopted a combination model based on wavelet networks to approximate and forecast the run characteristics of dam. The abnormality diagnosis is a process of discovering knowledge on the pattern between of disease and geneses. The methods of attributions reduction in rough sets theory were presented to diagnose adaptively the abnormal cases and find out the geneses. The safety status of dam changes dynamically, which emerges in the quantitative and qualitative change manners. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative changes need be considered comprehensively in the process of dam safety evaluation. This paper proposed an extension evaluation method. The quantitative change and qualitative change of dam safety property were integrated into a matter-element. Based on the matter-element extensibility, the contradictory problem for dam safety elevation can be solved. In practice, the proposed system has been used to monitor dam safety successfully. The applications show that the bionics model is feasible; the proposed key technologies are effective.

For digital control in large company, along with the use of machine learning, it is necessary to take into account the human factor. The paper examines the theoretical and practical issues that arise when applying machine learning technology with an edifier for estimation and management in a large industrial company. The model of learning bifurcation with the help of the edifier determines 2 alternative estimates of the random situation in the company. The integration of two such bifurcation models using systems engineering is proposed for learning quartering for company management. Incentives for company employees are provided on a learning quartering basis. In an environment of uncertainty, it is assumed that staff knows production capabilities better than management. Using this insight, employees can manipulate their activities to gain more incentives. Such unwanted activity can lead to the failure to use existing opportunities in which the company is interested. To solve this problem in the face of uncertainty, a mechanism for digital control of a two-level organizational system is proposed. This mechanism includes learning quartering with the help of an edifier and stimulation. Sufficient conditions have been found for the synthesis of such a mechanism, in which the staff makes full use of the available capabilities.

The MAV MBSE model has been used to develop mission phase functional flow diagrams for the Concept of Operations, decompose mission to vehicle subsystem functions, develop a functional decomposition, derive functional requirements, trace requirements up to customer-imposed requirements, trace requirements within MAV requirement space, identify requirements trace gaps, define and map the physical design space architecture, allocate requirements to subsystems, develop validation items, define assembly, integration, and test (AI&T) operations, and trace these items across driving goals to develop an integrated digital thread of systems engineering information used to drive design specifications, decision making, and ultimately design verification and validation. Findings and results associated with implementing MBSE in these ways, alongside traditional methods will be discussed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9843502/,2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO),5-12 March 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/ECCE44975.2020.9235599,machine learning enabled fast multi-objective optimization for electrified aviation power system design,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rise of more electric and all-electric aviation power systems, engineering efforts of system optimization shift to the electrical domain. A substantial amount of time and resources are dedicated to finding the best system architecture and design specifications to meet energy efficiency goals and physical constraints. Current processes utilize models of power system components to determine the optimal designs. However, such modeling is computationally expensive as numerous iterations are required to settle on an optimal design. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) enabled constrained multi-objective optimization solver to drastically reduce the amount of design iterations required for Pareto set discovery for power systems. The process contributes significantly to design automation. A heavy-duty vertical-takeoff-landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) power system is selected to demonstrate the efficacy and limitation of ML enabled optimization. Two extreme trials were run: 1) a search throughout the entire design space with only 9% valid designs within constraints; 2) a search throughout the valid design space. While Trial 1 was unsuccessful in discovering the Pareto front, Trial 2 uncovered all Pareto optimal designs with a 99% reduction of iterations compared to a brute force method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9235599/,2020 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE),11-15 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily.

In contrast to Open Data (OD), which e.g., governmental agencies provide to catalyze innovation, OCD is shared in open collaboration between commercial organizations, similar to OSS. To achieve this, there is a need for technical infrastructure (e.g., tools for version and access control), licence models, and governance models, all of which have to be tailored for data. However, as data may be sensitive for privacy, anonymization and obfuscation of data is also a research challenge.

In the last few decades, hundreds of methods have been suggested by many brilliant researchers around the world to improve the current forecasting tools. These tools are categorized as: deterministic, probabilistic, stochastic, and artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms. Among these approaches, artificial neural networks (ANNs) proved themselves as very competitive and highly precise methods to accurately forecast energy. ANNs are divided into two main types called: feed-forward networks and recurrent/feedback networks, where each type of them has multiple sub-types. This study tries to improve the performance of any existing type/sub-type of ANNs by optimizing its configuration through using the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm. The number of input variables, layers, neurons, and the types of activation functions and training algorithm all are optimized. The goal is to preserve the simplicity, so only very simple multi-layer feed-forward ANNs are used instead of using time-series-based feed-forward/feedback ANNs.

This paper is an attempt to join recent philosophical approaches and legal maneuvers with methods used in engineering to schematize the mechanisms of privacy. It starts with the notion propounded by French philosophers Deleuze and Guattari of a machine that produces and interrupts. A flow-based schematization is proposed as an apparatus for describing such a machines. The man as a machine metaphor is then incorporated to define privacy as a person's machine.

The design and engineering of Intelligent Systems to support large distributed socio technical processes increasingly leverages converging techniques from Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation (KR) and Cognitive Architectures. This is resulting in multi layered architectures and AI technologies which one the one hand offer unprecedented capabilities, on the other hand present innumerable, often inconceivable risks. Sophisticated conceptual structures are necessary not only to support the modeling, validation and explanation of complex engineered systems, but primarily to support cognition and conceptualization of the complexities involved, for designers, developers, end users and any stakeholder. Depending on the cognitive makeup of observers, and on the knowledge available, complexity can be conceptualized and traversed following a diversity of methods and patterns. Sometimes complexity can be broken down into cognitively accessible chunks, in other cases however, it cannot be broken down without losing essential information about the system as a whole. Addressing the need to develop cognitive artifacts, methods and techniques that can capture and represent complexity, this paper proposes the outline of conceptual structure that bridges existing approaches which tend to distinguish between cognitive engineering and Knowledge Representation, with the aim to integrate technical and socio technical systems dimensions. The paper presents considerations about cognitive aspects of complex systems theory and practice.

This manuscript proposes a new framework for best practices, described as T &E harnesses, that corresponds principally to the task of engineering a learning system-in contrast to the status quo task of solving a learning problem. The primary difference is a question of scope. This manuscript places T &E for ML into the broader scope of systems engineering processes. Importantly, two challenge problems, acquisition and operations, are used to motivate the use of T &E harnesses for learning systems. This manuscript draws from recent findings in experimental design for ML, combinatorial interaction testing of ML solutions, and the general systems modeling of ML. The concept of T &E harnesses is closely tied to existing models of systems engineering processes. We draw the conclusion that existing best practices for T &E form a subset of what is needed to rigorously test for system-level satisfaction of stakeholder needs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9984783/,2022 IEEE AUTOTESTCON,29 Aug.-1 Sept. 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843563,test and evaluation of reinforcement learning via robustness testing and explainable ai for high-speed aerospace vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides an ability to train an artificial intelligent agent in dynamic and uncertain environments. RL has demonstrated an impressive performance capability to learn nearly optimal policies in various application domains including aerospace. Despite the demonstrated performance outcomes of RL, characterizing performance boundaries, explaining the logic behind RL decisions, and quantifying resulting uncertainties in RL outputs are major challenges that slow down the adoption of RL in real-time systems. This is particularly true for aerospace systems where the risk of failure is high and performance envelopes of systems of interest may be small. To facilitate adoption of learning agents in real-time systems, this paper presents a three-part Test and Evaluation (T&E) framework for RL built from Systems engineering for artificial intelligence (SE4AI) perspective. This T&E framework introduces robustness testing approaches to characterize performance bounds on RL, employs Explainable AI techniques, namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to examine RL decision-making, and incorporates validation of RL outputs with known and accepted solutions. This framework is applied to a high-speed aerospace vehicle emergency descent problem where RL is trained to provide an angle of attack command and the framework is utilized to comprehensively examine the impact of uncertainties in the vehicle's altitude, velocity, and flight path angle. The robustness testing characterizes acceptable ranges of disturbances in flight parameters, while SHAP exposes the most significant features that impact RL selection of angle of attack-in this case the vehicle altitude. Finally, RL outputs are compared to trajectory generated by indirect optimal control methods for validation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9843563/,2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference (AERO),5-12 March 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/SMC.2019.8914324,the digital (mission) twin: an integrating concept for future adaptive cyber-physical-human systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Top-down decomposition of a complex system of systems (SoS) requires representation of the behavior of multiple individuals and cyber-physical systems performing a wide variety of tasks, usually at different times and with different goals. In the future, as humans and machines learn and co-adapt in their mission context, systems engineering must develop approaches that support dynamic analysis and synthesis in both the design and operation of systems. The concept of a “digital (mission) twin” provides an integration framework for design and control of future complex cyber-physical-human SoS. The framework builds on mission function task (MFT) analysis, providing a basis for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) activities to identify and address needs for automation or other forms of advanced technology that improve overall system performance. However, human-driven adaptation and eventually machine adaptation of complex SoS poses organizational and methodological challenges. We discuss the need for and opportunities for convergence of three often segregated SE methodologies: product engineering, human systems integration, and mission/operations analysis by expanding the product or process engineering view of a digital twin to the mission level. In the present this gives us a framework to analyze and specify automation and adaptation opportunities at the mission level. In the future we envision this twin continuously operates with the real systems to manage both emergent mission conditions and lifecycle adaptation. We applied this framework to a complex military mission using a case where artificial intelligence can be incorporated widely across a set of mission tasks to significantly improve performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8914324/,"2019 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)",6-9 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925740,toward airworthiness certification for artificial intelligence (ai) in aerospace systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Boeing “produced an airplane that had an unsafe condition” and admitted full responsibility for the second of its 737 MAX plane crash in Ethiopia in October 2018, killing 189 people. A major cause was found to be new flight control software, based on the AI (Artificial Intelligence) system called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) which needed to be modified. It appears that the MCAS was originally designed as a limited AI system aimed at nose correction based on wind resistance and force sensors. However, in 2012, Boeing expanded that the MCAS and these changes, coupled with inadequate pilot training made it more vulnerable to malfunctioning. These unfortunate developments have further underscored the urgency to address airworthiness given the rise in autonomous systems and their integration into the aerospace domain. While there is an increased interest in effectively managing/regulating the AI certification problem for isolated complex functions, there is little work done on the certification of AI for aircraft that jointly evaluates System of Systems (SoS) integration in tandem with the human machine team dynamics involved in the engineering and deployment of AI-based systems. As a result, the development of airworthiness certification criteria will lag the development of state-of-the-art intelligent systems. This paper presents various considerations to enable the development of certification criteria for AI when consulting aerospace system design guidance and standards, including MIL-HDBK-516C, DO-178, and FAA’s Airworthiness Certification Regulations. To allow for the validation and verification of AI-based systems to be safe, a systems engineering model is proposed to facilitate certification that includes an AI certification profile, verifiable implementation measures and a continuous process flow to ensure airworthiness that cannot be verified through traditional, test-based means. Furthermore, safety assurance approaches are identified for safety-critical systems that may include learning-enabled functions, with examples for both a Safety Critical Function Thread Analysis (SCFTA) and Failure Modes and Effects Testing (FMET). This paper represents a critical step towards the tailoring of airworthiness standards to include AI.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9925740/,2022 IEEE/AIAA 41st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),18-22 Sept. 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/DTPI59677.2023.10365449,toward digital twins for human-in-the-loop systems: a framework for workload management and burnout prevention in healthcare systems,IEEE,Conferences,"While digital twin (DT) research matured in the past decade, DT applications in human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems are nascent. HITL systems differ from engineered systems as they are sociotechnical systems (STSs) that rely on collaborating teams of humans for making safety-critical operational decisions. Healthcare systems (HSs), an archetypical STS, have recently attracted increased attention from DT research. Nevertheless, the current literature greatly overlooks the linkage between the system and the HITL - healthcare providers (i.e., doctors and nurses) in this case - particularly regarding the influence of work demands on HITL performance. This is problematic because provider performance plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and effectiveness of HSs. Taking providers’ interests and the long-term sustainability of HSs into account, this paper lays the foundation for a conceptual HITL workload DT for HSs. We provide an overview of the complex macroergonomic factors that influence provider workload using the systems engineering initiative for patient safety (SEIPS) framework and discuss workload quantification methods to operationalize this information. We then describe how DT modeling and twinning methods can be leveraged to collect and utilize relevant operational data for proactive management of provider workload. Finally, we discuss associated challenges such as data collection, establishment of necessary feedback mechanisms, and calibration of workload quantification methods. If successful, the proposed framework has the potential to effectively address a pressing national issue: provider burnout in HSs, while extending DT research to other STSs such as air and rail traffic control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365449/,2023 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI),7-9 Nov. 2023,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

These requirements jointly imply the need for a MBSE research testbed that enables experimentation with diverse modeling, analysis, simulation, verification, and validation approaches under nominal and off-nominal conditions, collect and analyze data to uncover patterns and trends, reuse models and components as applicable, and serve as a repository for scenarios, models, case studies, and lessons learned.

10.1109/AERO.2019.8742173,towards intelligent architecting of aerospace system-of-systems,IEEE,Conferences,"System-of-Systems (SoS) are composed of large scale independent and complex heterogeneous systems which collaborate to create capabilities not achievable by a single system, for example air transportation system, satellite constellations, and space exploration architectures. Much of the research effort in the field of SoS has focused on the analysis of these complex entities, while there are still major gaps in developing tools for automated synthesis and engineering of SoS that consider all the various aspects in this problem domain. The gap we address in this paper is a mapping of clusters of SoS architecture alternatives, segmented by performance along multiple metrics, to architectural features. Building upon our previous research where we used a SoS Analytic Work Bench in combination with Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts to perform analysis of aerospace systems, we propose to build a process for intelligent architecting of aerospace SoS. This process discovers and employs pertinent features in a complex design space to effectively meet the user needs, elevating SoS engineering from retrospective architectural analysis to automated synthesis of new architectures. As a first step towards intelligent architecture of aerospace SoS, we propose to utilize Machine Learning techniques to automate the synthesis phase of SoS. Our hypothesis is that a set of holistic metrics of aerospace architectures (cost, performance, robustness, operational risk, average delay, etc.) can be used to characterize a measure of goodness of architectures, with good architectures on a Pareto front of the multi-dimensional space of holistic metrics of interest. Each architecture or cluster may be then mapped to a set of architectural features, with the goal of identifying which features belong to good architectures. Specifically, we propose to utilize non-parametric regression on a set of training architectures (for example, Neural Networks can deal with mixed real and integer variables) to associate each one with a pattern of features. This mapping will allow the automated process to predict what metrics will be expected from SoS architectures with specific features, and therefore to automatically synthesize architectures that exhibit desired characteristics of goodness. For example, for constellations of satellites, a group of good architecture might have medium cost, high resilience, medium robustness, and low risk, and the architectural features to be mapped to each group can include number of satellites, number of components, type of orbit, type of power system, etc. Since the environment constantly evolves, architectures must adapt, and stochastic optimization can be used to switch between architectures with minimal effort. In this work we illustrate the new version of our aerospace SoS analysis and synthesis framework, which includes Machine Learning techniques to support synthesis of SoS architectures. We demonstrate the application of this process on satellite constellations and discuss challenges of this approach and future steps.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8742173/,2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference,2-9 March 2019,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/SUMMA50634.2020.9280681,training in control of production costs,IEEE,Conferences,"New trends in the management of production costs are associated with the development of Machine learning, taking into account the human factor. They often use a bifurcation procedure that assigns costs to one of two categories. For this, training of pattern recognition is applied. Systems engineering allows for more sophisticated partition learning models that categorize costs into one of four categories (quartering). For this, two bifurcation training models are integrated. Such quartering is used by the management of the company to stimulate personnel responsible for costs. However, if the management is not aware of the minimum costs, undesirable activity of the personnel is possible. In this case, personnel, as an active element, chooses costs so as to maximize own incentives. For this reason, the real costs of the company may be higher than the minimum. Therefore, traditional machine supervised learning algorithms for pattern recognition can be ineffective. To solve this problem in the face of uncertainty, a mechanism has been proposed that includes a procedure for training of quartering with the help of instructions from a trainer, as well as a procedure for stimulating. Sufficient conditions for the synthesis of such a mechanism are found, under which the costs are minimal. The use of this mechanism is illustrated with the example of training of quartering and incentives to reduce the cost of re-equipment of locomotives.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280681/,"2020 2nd International Conference on Control Systems, Mathematical Modeling, Automation and Energy Efficiency (SUMMA)",11-13 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

In Trellis, the data are broken up into subsets, a visualization method is applied to each subset, and the display result is an array of panels, one per subset. This is a powerful framework for visualization of data, both small and large. In D&R, the data are broken up into subsets, and any analytic method from statistics and machine learning is applied to each subset independently. Then the outputs are recombined. This provides not only a powerful framework for analysis, but also feasible and practical computations using distributed computational facilities. It enables deep analysis of the data: study of both data summaries as well as the detailed data at their finest granularity. This is critical to full understanding of the data. It also enables the analyst to program using an interactive high-level language for data analysis such as R, which allows the analyst to focus more on the data and less on code. In this paper we introduce Trelliscope, a system that scales Trellis to large complex data. It provides a way to create displays with a very large number of panels and an interactive viewer that allows the analyst to sort, filter, and sample the panels in a meaningful way.

Fusion, a specific aspect of C2 systems, is selected as a testbed for developing C2 cognitive engineering principles. The principles are developed by examining the relationship between how unaided human judges perform fusion and how systems currently perform fusion, assessing where problems do and could occur, and recommending first steps toward their solution via cooperative human-computer interaction.

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3153490,a socio-technical simulation model for the design of the future single pilot cockpit: an opportunity to improve pilot performance,IEEE,Journals,"The future deployment of single pilot operations must be supported by new cockpit computer services. Such services require an adaptive context-aware integration of technical functionalities with the concurrent tasks that a pilot must deal with. Advanced artificial intelligence supporting services and improved communication capabilities are the key enabling technologies that will render future cockpits more integrated with the present digitalized air traffic management system. However, an issue in the integration of such technologies is the lack of socio-technical analysis in the design of these teaming mechanisms. A key factor in determining how and when a service support should be provided is the dynamic evolution of pilot workload. This paper investigates how the socio-technical model-based systems engineering approach paves the way for the design of a digital assistant framework by formalizing this workload. The model was validated in an Airbus A-320 cockpit simulator, and the results confirmed the degraded pilot behavioral model and the performance impact according to different contextual flight deck information.

10.1109/TSE.2020.3025732,automated generation of consistent graph models with multiplicity reasoning,IEEE,Journals,"Advanced tools used in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) frequently represent their models as graphs. In order to test those tools, the automated generation of well-formed (or intentionally malformed) graph models is necessitated which is often carried out by solver-based model generation techniques. In many model generation scenarios, one needs more refined control over the generated unit tests to focus on the more relevant models. Type scopes allow to precisely define the required number of newly generated elements, thus one can avoid the generation of unrealistic and highly symmetric models having only a single type of elements. In this paper, we propose a 3-valued scoped partial modeling formalism, which innovatively extends partial graph models with predicate abstraction and counter abstraction. As a result, well-formedness constraints and multiplicity requirements can be evaluated in an approximated way on incomplete (unfinished) models by using advanced graph query engines with numerical solvers (e.g., IP or LP solvers). Based on the refinement of 3-valued scoped partial models, we propose an efficient model generation algorithm that generates models that are both well-formed and satisfy the scope requirements. We show that the proposed approach scales significantly better than existing SAT-solver techniques or the original graph solver without multiplicity reasoning. We illustrate our approach in a complex design-space exploration case study of collaborating satellites introduced by researchers at NASA JPL.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201551/,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,1 May 2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

This study introduces the concept of autonomous services, a new service paradigm, and autonomous services systems, in which intelligent vehicles are vital enabling technology. Specifically, autonomous services aim to minimize unnecessary human participation and effort in the service process by leveraging intelligence for service delivery, rather than relying on simple stimulus-response or rule-based program behavior. This letter reports on the first Decentralized and Hybrid Workshop (DHW) on autonomous services, aiming to reduce the cost of human labor and improve the quality and efficiency of service while tackling the challenges posed by a shrinking workforce. The introduction of intelligent vehicles enhances the capability of the service systems, while also significantly increasing complexity. To address the challenges associated with complexity, the Systems Engineering (SE) approach is indispensable. The Requirements-Functional-Logical-Physical (RFLP) framework can implement Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and help researchers and managers to understand the autonomous services system more comprehensively, so as to better operate and manage it.

The development of PrEM optimization algorithms has been tailored to selfish vehicle operation and implemented in the form of vehicle dynamics and/or adaptive powertrain control functions. With the progress in vehicle automation, this paper focuses on extending PrEM into the realm of a System of Systems (SoS). The proposed approach uses the shared information among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) and the infrastructure to synthesize a reduced energy speed trajectory at the cohort level within urban environments. Neuroevolution is employed to incorporate a generalized optimum controller, robust to the emergent behaviors typical of multi-agents SoS. The authors demonstrated the use of heuristics and systems engineering processes in abstracting and integrating the resulting neural network within the control architecture, which enables novel added-value features such as green wave pass/fail classification and e-Horizon velocity prediction. The resulting controller is faster than real-time and was validated with a multi-agent simulation environment and on a real-world closed-loop track at the American Center for Mobility (ACM).

Therefore, for such a system to continually self-improve, it must provide the right data and models to support human decisions on selection of alternatives likely to improve the quality of its services. Our focus in this paper is to show how modeling and simulation (M&S) can help design service infrastructures that introduce coordination and bring into play the conditions for learning and continuous improvement. To do this, we discuss the application of the discrete event system specification (DEVS) formalism within system of systems engineering (SoSE) to develop coordination models for transactions that involve multiple disparate activities of component systems and that need to be selectively sequenced to implement patient-centered coordinated care interventions.

Transfer learning can address nonstationarity by sharing knowledge from one system to another, however, in areas like machine prognostics and defense, data are fundamentally limited. Therefore, transfer learning algorithms have little, if any, examples from which to learn. Herein, the authors suggest that these constraints on algorithmic learning can be addressed by systems engineering. We formally define transfer distance in general terms and demonstrate its use in empirically quantifying the transferability of models. We consider the use of transfer distance in the design of machine rebuild procedures to allow for transferable prognostic models.

This is the focus of personal construct theory (PCT), which states that experiences are meaningful only in relation to the way they are “constructed.” Within the higher education system, the “constructs” developed by students determine the way in which they perceive their learning environment and are used to judge or evaluate their learning experiences. To reveal the constructs developed by students, a structured interview methodology known as the repertory grid technique can be used. In this paper, the repertory grid technique is exploited to evaluate a consensus-based constructive alignment theory implementation in a M.Sc.-level power systems analysis course. The repertory grid technique is utilized as an approach to effectively gather feedback from students through interviews during course evaluation meetings. It is shown that the repertory grid technique provides much valuable, insightful quantitative and qualitative data. Experience in using this technique revealed shortcomings that are illustrated and discussed in detail. Various visual and statistical methods are applied to analyze the elicited repertory grids.

A smart interface to visualize high-level information fused from a diversity of low-level surveillance data, and to facilitate rapid response of events, is critical for the design of the system. This paper presents an event-driven visualization mechanism fusing multimodal information for a large-scale intelligent video surveillance system. The mechanism proactively helps security personnel intuitively be aware of events through close cooperation among visualization, data fusion, and sensor tasking. The visualization not only displays 2-D, 3-D, and geographical information within a condensed form of interface but also automatically shows the only important video streams corresponding to spontaneous alerts and events by a decision process called display switching arbitration. The display switching arbitration decides the importance of cameras by score ranking that considers event urgency and semantic object features. This system has been successfully deployed in a campus to demonstrate its usability and efficiency for an installation with two camera clusters that include dozens of cameras, and with a lot of video analytics to detect alerts and events. A further simulation comparing the display switching arbitration with similar camera selection methods shows that our method improves the visualization by selecting better representative camera views and reducing redundant switchover among multiview videos.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7428948/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",April 2017,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

This approach addresses the existing challenge in identification of the actual abnormality of the vital cardiac signal from the various interrupting factors like bio-signal faulted due to high noise signal interference, electronic and software fault, mechanical fault like sensor contacts failures, wear and tear of equipment. Presently, most of the medical systems use a 1oo1(one-out-of-one) system architectures, and there exists a safety procedure to raise a particular defined type of standard alarm for a specific failure to detect an abnormality. These existing approaches may incur high maintenance costs and subject to random failures with long downtimes of the system and where it affects operational safety to a certain extent. However, there is a scope to improve in the segregation of the actual fault-free signal and extract the abnormality of the vital feature for prognostic diagnostics. With advancements in systems engineering and usage of safety-related design architectures in medical systems, we used an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approach in performing the data analytics on the selected correct vital signal for prognostic analysis.

The current practice is that many models are developed from scratch, while they could have been built by reusing existing models. Moreover, when models need reconfiguration, they often need to be rebuilt significantly. These problems reduce the development efficiency and ultimately damage the efficacy of ABM. This paper partially resolves the challenges of model reusability from the systems engineering approach. Specifically, we propose a formalism-based ABM development and demonstrate its potential to promote model reuses. Our formalism, named large-scale, dynamic, extensible, and flexible (LDEF) formalism, encourages the building of a larger model by the composition of modularly developed components. Also, LDEF is tailored to the ABM contexts to represent the agent's action procedure and support the dynamic changes of their interactions.

The burgeoning Big Service computing just covers the significant challenges in constructing and maintaining a stable service-oriented SoS. A service-oriented SoS runs under a volatile and uncertain environment. As a step toward big service, service fault tolerance (FT) can guarantee the run-time quality of a service-oriented SoS. To successfully deploy FT in an SoS, online reliability time series prediction, which aims at predicting the reliability in near future for a service-oriented SoS arises as a grand challenge in SoS research. In particular, we need to tackle a number of big data related issues given the large and fast increasing size of the historical data that will be used for prediction purpose.

10.1109/OJSE.2024.3366939,method for measuring resilience of complex systems using network theory and graph energy,IEEE,Journals,"Because of societies’ dependence on systems that have increasing interconnectedness, governments and industries have an increasing interest in managing the resilience of these systems and the risks associated with their disruption or failure. The identification and localization of tipping points in complex systems is essential in predicting system collapse but exceedingly difficult to estimate. At critical tipping-point thresholds, systems may transition from stable to unstable and potentially collapse. One of the approaches to measuring a complex system's resilience to collapse has been to model the system as a network, reduce the network behavior to a simpler model, and measure the resulting model's stability. In particular, Gao et al. introduced a method in 2016 that includes a resilience index that measures precariousness, the distance to tipping points. However, those mathematical reductions can cause the model to lose information on the topological complexity of the system. Using computational experimentation, a new method has been formulated that more-accurately predicts the resilience and location of tipping points in networked systems by integrating Gao et al.’s method with a measurement of a system's topological complexity using graph energy, which arose from molecular orbital theory. Herein, this method for measuring and managing system resilience is outlined with case studies involving ecosystem collapse, supply-chain sustainability, and disruptive technology. The precariousness of these example systems is found using the dimension reduction, and a graph-energy correction is quantified to fine-tune the measurement. Lastly, the integration of this method into systems engineering processes is explored to provide a measurement of precariousness and give insight into how a complex system's topology affects the location of its tipping points.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443825/,IEEE Open Journal of Systems Engineering,2024,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

One of the biggest challenges to predicting student performance is presented in the course “Programming Fundamentals” of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Information Systems Engineering careers in Peruvian universities for high student dropout rates. The objective of this research was to explore the efficiency of Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM) to predict the academic performance of students during the seventh, eighth, twelfth, and sixteenth weeks of the academic semester, which allowed us to identify students at risk of failing the course. This research compares several predictive models, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). A major challenge machine learning algorithms face is a class imbalance in a dataset, resulting in over-fitting to the available data and, consequently, low accuracy.

To answer the need for domain-specific contextualised word embedding in the space field, we propose SpaceTransformers, a novel family of three models, SpaceBERT, SpaceRoBERTa and SpaceSciBERT, respectively further pre-trained from BERT, RoBERTa and SciBERT on our domain-specific corpus. We collect and label a new dataset of space systems concepts based on space standards. We fine-tune and compare our domain-specific models to their general counterparts on a domain-specific Concept Recognition (CR) task. Our study rightly demonstrates that the models further pre-trained on a space corpus outperform their respective baseline models in the Concept Recognition task, with SpaceRoBERTa achieving significant higher ranking overall.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548078/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161438,stochastically forced ensemble dynamic mode decomposition for forecasting and analysis of near-periodic systems,IEEE,Journals,"Time series forecasting remains a central challenge problem in almost all scientific disciplines. We introduce a novel load forecasting method in which observed dynamics are modeled as a forced linear system using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in time delay coordinates. Central to this approach is the insight that grid load, like many observables on complex real-world systems, has an “almost-periodic” character, i.e., a continuous Fourier spectrum punctuated by dominant peaks, which capture regular (e.g., daily or weekly) recurrences in the dynamics. The forecasting method presented takes advantage of this property by (i) regressing to a deterministic linear model whose eigenspectrum maps onto those peaks, and (ii) simultaneously learning a stochastic Gaussian process regression (GPR) process to actuate this system. Our forecasting algorithm is compared against state-of-the-art forecasting techniques not using additional explanatory variables and is shown to produce superior performance. We further show that this joint approach offers marked improvement over existing methods that use purely DMD or GPR. Moreover, its use of linear intrinsic dynamics offers a number of desirable properties in terms of interpretability and parsimony. Results are presented for a test case using load data from an electrical grid. Load forecasting is an essential challenge in power systems engineering, with major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security decisions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9739722/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')

This encompassing GMCR methodology has been constructed during the past three decades by the authors, their colleagues and students from many countries for addressing a rich range of conflict situations. GMCR can be used for studying large and small conflicts and includes methods for preference elicitation, preference uncertainty (unknown, fuzzy, grey numbers and probabilistic). Many kinds of definitions exist for possible human behavior under pure competition which can be transformed for utilization in coalition analysis. GMCR can handle emotions, attitudes, and misperceptions. Within inverse GMCR, one can calculate the preferences needed by decision makers (DMs) to reach a desirable equilibrium. Under behavioral GMCR one can ascertain the strategic thinking of DMs when the input and output are known. Decision support systems can be built for implementing the array of GMCR advancements.

Prior work has shown that there is a language of systems thinking and that its presence can be quantified within text using supervised learning methods. Building on this foundation, we present a human-in-the-loop methodology that utilizes topic models to facilitate the identification of systems thinking within a corpus of documents. Though explorative, it requires no manual grading of documents, which makes it significantly faster than previous methods. The methodology uses each document's topic proportion within a systems thinking topic as a proxy measure for the potential of strong systems thinking. The novel aspect of the methodology is in the seeding of the corpus; the user encourages the emergence of the systems thinking topic by adding several documents that demonstrate strong systems thinking to the corpus. Additionally, seeding could be used with concepts other than systems thinking. A Tukey test on a graded corpus reveals that the top echelons of strong systems thinking papers have significantly higher mean topic proportions in the systems thinking topic than lower graded papers. Additionally, a case study on a corpus of Army documents related to the development, character, and management of soldiers demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in overviewing a system and in providing research direction.

To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9268157/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
10.1109/JSYST.2015.2426651,use of natural language processing to discover evidence of systems thinking,IEEE,Journals,"In prior work, we proposed elements of a generalized core language for systems thinking that characterizes a systems approach. We developed this foundational language through the relationship between critical thought and systems in the definition of systems thinking. We submitted our interpretation of this language, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking (DST), to the systems community for further development. Assuming that the DST provides a basis in language to express systems thought in a systems design or analysis, our objective in this phase is to present a strategy for discovering objective statistical evidence of systems thinking based on the linguistic elements of the DST in an unread corpus of documents. With that goal, we consider statistical semantic characterization of systems thought through a process of supervised learning, term frequency and inverse document frequency (tf-idf), cosine similarity, and naïve Bayes classifiers, specifically Rocchio classifiers and quadratic discriminant classification. Finding evidence of systems thinking in unread text through natural language processing establishes a foundation for computationally assessing systems thinking quality in a document or corpus of design-related documents without having to read the subject document or corpus. Once demonstrated, the method can be applied to systems thinking fluency in design-focused documents across a range of application areas, such as transportation, healthcare, and environmental policy. This study demonstrates that capability with a high degree of selectivity. Our approach establishes correlation and allows us to assess the systems thinking quality of a corpus of unread analysis and design studies on life cycle assessment. We show that assigning a prior probability improves that assessment.

By appreciating the reality that systems of systems are inhabited by multiple participants or agents having multiple objectives, one can adhere to adaptive and integrative decision making principles to properly design, construct, maintain, and operate systems of systems that serve the interests of stakeholders in a fair and sustainable manner throughout the systems’ life cycles. An insightful way is explained for classifying systems of systems in the world according to environmental (natural world), societal (real life), intelligent (artificial life) and integrated (mixed life) systems of systems. To examine strategic behaviour in societal systems of systems, some of the latest contributions in systems thinking techniques are discussed for advancing the paradigm of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution including modeling value systems, taking preference uncertainty and strength of preference into account, describing how emotions can affect decision making under conflict, and tracing the evolution of a conflict from a status quo situation to a final equilibrium. A real world environmental conflict is employed to illustrate how cooperation among decision makers can produce a more preferred win/win resolution which cannot be reached when they behave independently in a purely competitive manner. In fact, tremendous opportunities abound for researchers and practitioners in systems, man and cybernetics to develop flexible smart systems tools in multiple participant-multiple objective decision making for both cooperative and independent interactive situations to tackle pressing global problems, such as climate change and globalization of trade, from a multidisciplinary viewpoint.

Facing a multitude of challenges such as economic pressure, demographic change, and environmental demands, urban last mile supply networks are increasingly strained. Various solutions and strategies such as the integration of novel technologies and collaborative approaches are discussed in the literature and tested in case studies. The application of artificial intelligence for supply networks holds potential for future urban logistics optimization and is thus considered a relevant research avenue. A design science approach comprising system dynamics-based modeling is chosen due to last mile networks' inherent complexity.

To meet these challenges, many are turning to Industry 4.0 technology to be more resilient, sustainable and efficient. However, there is a risk of mass adoption failure due to products being developed in silos that impact product usability, availability, interoperability and adaptability. The financial viability of Industry 4.0 technology adoption is also challenging for many crops. This is due to the high variety of activities being required for only short periods of time during the growing season. This paper proposes a Horticulture System of Systems (SoS) approach, that goes beyond data interoperability, to promote the collaboration of individual constituent systems into an equitable, affordable, optimised ecosystem. The paper utilises systems thinking to identify inter-dependencies and potential opportunities (use cases) to leverage Industry 4.0 technology within the kiwifruit industry in New Zealand. A Modular Agritech Systems for Horticulture (MAS-H) concept is proposed focusing on re-usable sensing, image recognition, robotics hardware and software on-orchard, along with an industry-good data gateway and digital twin.

10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00012,software engineering as the linchpin of responsible ai,IEEE,Conferences,"From humanity's existential risks to safety risks in critical systems to ethical risks, responsible AI, as the saviour, has become a major research challenge with significant real-world consequences. However, achieving responsible AI remains elusive despite the plethora of high-level ethical principles, risk frameworks and progress in algorithmic assurance. In the meantime, software engineering (SE) is being upended by AI, grappling with building system-level quality and alignment from inscrutable machine learning models and code generated from natural language prompts. The upending poses new challenges and opportunities for engineering AI systems responsibly. This talk will share our experiences in helping the industry achieve responsible AI systems by inventing new SE approaches. It will dive into industry challenges (such as risk silos and principle-algorithm gaps) and research challenges (such as lack of requirements, emerging properties and inscrutable systems) and make the point that SE is the linchpin of responsible AI. But SE also requires some fundamental rethinking - shifting from building functions into AI systems to discovering and managing emerging functions from AI systems. Only by doing so can SE take on critical new roles, from understanding human intelligence to building a thriving human-AI symbiosis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172687/,2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),14-20 May 2023,ieeexplore,systems engineering,'systems engineering' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence')
