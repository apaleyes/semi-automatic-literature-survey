                  Increased global competition has placed a premium on customer satisfaction, and there is a greater demand for manufacturers to be flexible with their products and services. This challenge is usually addressed with the introduction of human operators for precise tasks that require dexterity, flexibility and cognitive decision making. On the other hand, robots, through automation, are very effective in carrying out repetitive, non-ergonomic tasks. Owing to the complementary nature of robots’ and humans’ capabilities, there is an increased interest towards a shared workspace for humans and robots to work together collaboratively, forming the motivation behind the field of human-robot collaboration (HRC). Research in HRC in industry is concerned with the safety of the humans and robots, extent, and modes of collaboration among them, and the level of autonomy and adaptability of robots that can be trained for different tasks. This paper introduces a novel taxonomy of levels of interaction between humans and robots along the lines of SAEs guidelines for autonomous vehicles in response to a need for standard definitions and evolving nature of the field. Research into modes of communication for HRC driven by machine learning are reviewed followed by broad definitions of the types of machine learning. The authors also present a comprehensive review of the machine learning (ML) methodologies and industrial applications of the same in the context of adaptable collaborative robots.

                  In this paper, an adaptive tracking control scheme is investigated for a medium scale unmanned autonomous helicopter (UAH) with unknown external disturbances and system uncertainties to achieve improvement on the flight performance. The neural networks (NNs) are employed to compensate the system uncertainties. The second-order disturbance observers are introduced to restrain the compound disturbances which are combined with the NN approximation errors and the external disturbances. Accordingly, the tracking control law is designed for the UAH. The closed-loop stability of the whole UAH system is proved by using Lyapunov function method. Simulation results show that the developed control scheme can effectively solve the tracking control problems of UAH and certainly accomplish strong robustness with respect to the external disturbances and system uncertainties.

                  Although energy efficiency is quite a cliché term, it is a topic that attracts an increasing attention the last decade, especially in the context of cities and as a means to address emerging challenges like sustainability and climate change. Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical -and even autonomous- vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies’ energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development. This article focuses on the impact of AI and big data in city's energy efficiency. More specifically, a literature analysis is performed and returned a taxonomy of existing energy efficiency assessment models under the lens of AI and big data. Moreover, the definition of a unified assessment model for AI and big data energy efficiency is approached.

                  The present work aims to study how deep learning approaches solve the safety problems in the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. A Vehicle-Pedestrian Detection (VPD) algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed regarding the massive amounts of parameters during feature extraction of traditional vehicle–pedestrian interaction algorithms. Furthermore, the Squeezenet algorithm is applied to extract traffic characteristics with fewer parameters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through simulation experiments. Results demonstrate that when the successful transmission probability reaches 100% and the λ value is 0.01–0.05, the proposed algorithm can provide the result closest to the actual value, with the smallest data delay and the highest data transmission security. In different categories, the proposed algorithm can provide the highest accuracy as the number of iterations increases compared with other algorithms (AlexNet, DenseNet, VGGNet, IGCNet, and ResNet), which can accurately forecast traffic safety accidents. The proposed algorithm can provide an accuracy of 81.98%, an improvement of at least 1.94% over other advanced CNNs, and at least 3.3% over algorithms included in comparative simulations. Hence, it can recognize and identify safe interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Through experiments, the constructed algorithm can significantly reduce the data transmission delay, improve the prediction accuracy of the safe interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, and increase the recognition accuracy remarkably, which can provide experimental references for the intelligent development of the transportation industry in the future.

                  Wildfire is one of the most critical natural disasters that threaten wildlands and forest resources. Traditional firefighting systems, which are based on ground crew inspection, have several limits and can expose firefighters’ lives to danger. Thus, remote sensing technologies have become one of the most demanded strategies to fight against wildfires, especially UAV-based remote sensing technologies. They have been adopted to detect forest fires at their early stages, before becoming uncontrollable. Autonomous wildfire early detection from UAV-based visual data using different deep learning algorithms has attracted significant interest in the last few years. To this end, in this paper, we focused on wildfires detection at their early stages in forest and wildland areas, using deep learning-based computer vision algorithms to prevent and then reduce disastrous losses in terms of human lives and forest resources.

                  Haze removal is an essential requirement in autonomous vehicle applications for identifying different objects on the road. Most of the available techniques are based on different constraints/priors. The important parameters required for recovering the ground truth from hazy image are transmission map and air light. In this paper, we proposed a learning-based Encoder-Decoder deep learning architecture for transmission map estimation. Based on the assumption that at least twenty percent of the outdoor image includes with sky region and hence airlight is calculated as average of the twenty percent brightest pixels of the image. These two parameters namely transmission map and airlight were applied in atmospheric scattering model for ground truth image recovery. In Encoder-Decoder architecture, Max pooling layer, dropout layer was used for feature learning and efficient generalization respectively. The proposed architecture was trained on different datasets like NYU Depth data set, FRIDA and RESIDE Dataset for better generalization on unseen data. Experimental results shows that the proposed method has shown better performance compared to the existing state of the art methods.

                  The increase application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of robotics, have emerged the need for real time algorithms for autonomous unmanned aircraft and surface vehicles. In recent years, various studies have been conducted for path planning of unmanned surface vehicle (USV), especially to maritime transportation. Most of the traditional approaches include optimization algorithms for finding the shortest or fastest path. However, USV motion in complex environments demand multi-objective optimization and multi-modality constraints to cope with dynamic environments and moving obstacles. To this end, an improved Ant Colony Optimization with Fuzzy Logic (ACO-FL) is proposed to deal with local path planning for obstacle avoidance by taking into account wind, current, wave and dynamic obstacles. The proposed algorithm was compared to original ACO and popular Bug algorithm in simulation tests. The results showed that ACO-FL reached better performance compared to the other algorithms under examination in terms of optimal solution and convergence speed. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be considered as an effective approach for path planning of USVs.

                  Predicting the outcomes of integrating Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex problem, which is required to be addressed by simulation studies before allowing the routine access of UAS into the NAS. This paper focuses on providing a 3-dimensional (3D) simulation framework using a game-theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, the human pilot interactive decision-making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using a dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional “static” approach, each agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers. An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an Example 3D scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.

                  This research presents a framework based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict jaywalker’s trajectory while crossing the road. In this process, different causal and conditional variables related to jaywalking, such as, gender, direction of crossing, walking or running, cell phone use, roadway lane number, etc. are taken as input variables. The dataset comprises of 2504 samples which is collected under non-lane based heterogeneous traffic conditions. Through testing predictive performance of several ANN architectures based on correlation co-efficient and mean square error, the best ANN architecture to predict jaywalker’s movement is determined. The optimal ANN architecture comprises of 9 input nodes, 10 hidden nodes and 1 output node. This study also determines the microscopic variables, i.e., speed, flow and density, associated with jaywalking. The results indicate that the average speed of male jaywalkers is higher than female jaywalkers. The density is found to be higher in the last lanes of the crossing paths. In addition, this research develops jaywalker trajectories in order to understand their position shifting strategies. Findings suggest that ‘median to sidewalk’ movement trajectories tend to move closer to the foot-over bridge, whereas, the ‘sidewalk to median’ movement trajectories tend to move further away from foot-over bridge. The outcome of this research is expected to assist driver assistance technology as well as Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technologies by allowing vehicles to safely navigate through both clustered and individual jaywalkers.

                  This study tests how individuals attribute responsibility to an artificial intelligent (AI) agent or a human agent based on their involvement in a negative or positive event. In an online, vignette experimental between-subjects design, participants (n = 230) responded to a questionnaire measuring their opinions about the level of responsibility and involvement attributed to an AI agent or human agent across rescue (i.e., positive) or accident (i.e., negative) driving scenarios. Results show that individuals are more likely to attribute responsibility to an AI agent during rescues, or positive events. Also, we find that individuals perceive the actions of AI agents similarly to human agents, which supports CASA framework's claims that technologies can have agentic qualities. In order to explain why individuals do not always attribute full responsibility for an outcome to an AI agent, we use Expectancy Violation Theory to understand why people credit or blame artificial intelligence during unexpected events. Implications of findings for practical applications and theory are discussed.

                  Both recognition and 3D tracking of frontal dynamic objects are crucial problems in an autonomous vehicle, while depth estimation as an essential issue becomes a challenging problem using a monocular camera. Since both camera and objects are moving, the issue can be formed as a structure from motion (SFM) problem. In this paper, to elicit features from an image, the YOLOv3 approach is utilized beside an OpenCV tracker. Subsequently, to obtain the lateral and longitudinal distances, a nonlinear SFM model is considered alongside a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) filter and a newly developed observation model. Additionally, a switching method in the form of switching estimation error covariance is proposed to enhance the robust performance of the SDRE filter. The stability analysis of the presented filter is conducted on a class of discrete nonlinear systems. Furthermore, the ultimate bound of estimation error caused by model uncertainties is analytically obtained to investigate the switching significance. Simulations are reported to validate the performance of the switched SDRE filter. Finally, real-time experiments are performed through a multi-thread framework implemented on a Jetson TX2 board, while radar data is used for the evaluation.

                  Deep learning models have been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial attacks even with imperceptible perturbations. As such, the reliability of existing deep neural networks-based autonomous driving systems can suffer. However, deep 3D models have applications in various Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) with safety-critical requirements, particularly autonomous driving systems. In this paper, the robustness of deep 3D object detection models under adversarial point cloud perturbations has been investigated. A novel method is developed to generate 3D adversarial examples from point cloud perturbations, which are common due to the intrinsic characteristics of the data captured by 3D sensors, e.g., LiDAR. The generation of adversarial samples is supervised by a dual loss, which constitutes an adversarial loss and a perturbation loss. The adversarial loss produces a point cloud with the property of aggressiveness, while the perturbation loss enforces the produced point cloud subject to visual imperception. We demonstrate that the method can successfully attack 3D object detection models in most cases, and expose their vulnerability to physical-world attacks in the form of point cloud perturbations. We perform a thorough evaluation of popular deep 3D object detectors in an adversarial setting on the KITTI vision benchmark. Experimental results show that current deep 3D object detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks in the context of autonomous driving, and their performances are degraded by a large margin in the presence of adversarial point clouds generated by the proposed method.

                  Inferring the intended actions of road-sharing users with autonomous ground vehicles in particularly vulnerable ones like cyclists is considered one of the tough tasks facing the wide-spread deployment of autonomous ground vehicles.

In this work, we first propose a pipeline that can synthetically produce 3D LiDAR data of cyclists hand-signalling a set of intended actions that are commonly done in real environments. Given the synthetically-produced labelled 3D LiDAR data sequences, we trained a framework that can simultaneously detect, track and give predictions about the intended actions of multi-cyclists in the scene on time. The proposed framework was evaluated using both synthetic and real data from a physical 3D LiDAR sensor. Our proposed framework has scored competitive and robust results in both synthetic and real environments with 88% in

The finite-time command filter is utilized to filtering the virtual control signal, the error compensation signal is constructed to eliminate filtering error due to the use of filter, and the NN approximation technology is used to deal with the unknown nonlinear dynamics. The control scheme can guarantee that the consensus tracking errors of position states converge into the desired neighborhood of the origin in finite-time while not exceeding the predefined constraints. Finally, simulation studies prove the feasibility of proposed control algorithm.

                  An Immersion and Invariance [I & I] controller is designed to control the nonlinear lateral vehicle’s motion, using the steering angle as the only input. Similar to most of the lateral vehicle’s dynamics control law, the cornering stiffness parameters are involved in our proposed controller. Because of the tight relation between tire/road properties and the cornering stiffness parameters, they are not available from the outputs of the sensors and therefore, should be estimated for utilizing in the control law. An online data-driven identification is employed for estimating the cornering stiffness parameters. In addition, a robust model-based fault detection and approximation method in the presence of uncertainties via neural networks is presented. The performance of the obtained control law is investigated via simulation tests in different situations and in the presence of the disturbance. Moreover, some validation tests are performed using the CarSim software to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.

                  With heterogeneous traffic agents moving at unprotected phase, severe crossing conflicts are witnessed at mixed-flow intersections, especially when left-turning vehicles are confronted with motorcycles. However, for modelling vehicle turning behaviour, potential conflicts involving diagonal-crossing motorcycles are seldom investigated in existing studies. To explore these scenes, we present a novel interaction-aware deep-learning framework. Firstly, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Secondly, each vehicle’s potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module that extracts and summarizes intention features. Thirdly, Graph Attention Network (GAT) and a synthesized network are introduced to model vehicle-vehicle interaction and vehicle-motorcycle interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM based decoder module, where both future displacement and body orientation of vehicles are predicted. In short-time simulation experiments, average displacement error is reduced by 47.7% and 20.0% compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies conducted to quantify the efficacy of each kind of feature. Moreover, regarding recursive simulation, our model shows availability of reproducing lane-selecting and motorcycle-evasive behaviours. Distributions of post-encroachment time further indicate that the proposed framework can serve as a promising method to realize reliable motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

                  This paper mainly focuses on using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to deal with the cooperative decision-making problem of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (multi-AUVs) under limited perception and limited communication in attack–defense confrontation missions. Firstly, a novel Coding-Convolutional Network (CCN) is proposed, which can encode the raw sensor information of AUVs and extract representative features from limited perception. Secondly, utilizing the approximator of the state value function and policy function composed of CCN and fully connected network, we put forward a centralized decision-making architecture for multi-AUVs system based on actor–critic framework and give the corresponding algorithm combined with asynchronous training. Moreover, with respect to multi-AUVs attack–defense confrontation tasks, we develop a simulation platform to train and evaluate the proposed algorithms under different parameters. It can be directly observed from the visualization of the simulation that the algorithm enables multi-AUVs to complete the attack–defense confrontation missions excellently and generate some interesting collaborative behaviors. The average winning probability data of the simulation results also indicate that the designed method is feasible for multi-AUVs to achieve cooperative decision-making in attack–defense confrontation missions.

                  Predicting lane change behavior of surrounding vehicles is critical for autonomous vehicles as the lane change may cause conflict between vehicles. Most of the existing lane change prediction models cannot update their model to adapt to the change of road and traffic environment, such as free and congested traffic environments and roads with different levels. Thus, those models cannot be robust. This paper aims to break this limitation and builds a lane change prediction model for surrounding vehicles based on machine learning methods. The lane change prediction model contains a basic model and an adaptive model: the basic model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model which reflects the decision-making mode for drivers; the adaptive prediction model embeds an adaptive decision threshold on the basic model, and the threshold updates by Bayesian Inference method on time. We prove the performance of the adaptive model based on the HighD dataset, and the results are inspiring that the model achieves 93.64–97.52% accuracies for target-vehicle in the left adjacent lane and 94.30–98.01% accuracies for target-vehicle in the right adjacent lane. Besides, our proposed model is capable of different driving environments, especially when the traditional LSTM method cannot capture drivers’ lane change decision well. Because of the timeliness and transferability nature of our proposed model, this model could be applied to the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles in the future to reduce driving perception errors.

In this paper, a novel explainable deep neural network-based path planner is proposed for quadrotor to fly autonomously in unknown environment. The navigation problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the path planner is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method in simulation environment. To get better understanding of the trained model, a novel model explanation method is proposed based on the feature attribution. Some easy-to-interpret textual and visual explanations are generated to allow end-users to understand what triggered a particular behaviour. Moreover, some global analyses are provided for experts to evaluate and improve the trained network. Finally, real-world flight tests are conducted to illustrate that our path planner trained in the simulation is robust enough to be applied in the real environment directly.

                  Deep learning has made remarkable progress in the field of image classification and object detection. Nevertheless, in the autonomous driving research, the real-time lane line detection and lane offset estimation in complex traffic scenes have always been challenging and difficult tasks. Traditional detection methods need manual adjustment of parameters, they face many problems and difficulties and are still highly susceptible to interference caused by obstructing objects, illumination changes, and pavement wear. It is still challenging to design a robust lane detection and lane offset estimation algorithm. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network for lane offset estimation and lane line detection in a complex road environment, which transforms the problems of lane line detection into the instance’s segmentation. In response to a change in the method of lane processing, the network will form its example to each line. The global scale perception optimization mechanism is designed to solve the issue, especially where the lane line width is gradually narrowing at the vanishing point of the lane. At the same time, to realize multi-tasking processing and improve performance, and end-to-end lane offset estimation network is used in addition to the lane line detection network.

                  With the rapid evolution and proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) throughout the past decade, industry-wide Deep Learning (DL) applications within IIoT ecosystems are expected to rise exponentially within this coming decade. However, recent studies have highlighted the extreme sensitivity and vulnerability of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples. While being imperceptible and benign to the naked human eye, those adversarial perturbations crafted from one-pixel attacks can drastically impact the accuracy of DNNs. The consequences of those adversarial attacks in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles can prove disastrous. Therefore, the urge to ensure the robustness and resilience of DL systems against one-pixel attacks has recently started attracting stupendous attention from both academicians and industry professionals. Throughout this paper, we first develop a one-pixel threat model within an IIoT ecosystem and propose a novel image recovery defense mechanism to detect and mitigate one-pixel attacks based on Accelerated Proximal Gradient approach. Experimental results proved that our proposed solution is highly effective and efficient in detecting and mitigating one-pixel attacks in state-of-the-art neural networks, more specifically LeNet and ResNet, using the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.

Also, this study proposes a new recurrent neural network-based VIO rather than just introducing a new dataset. In addition, the effectiveness of this proposed method is proven by comparing it with the state-of-the-arts ORB-SLAM2 and OKVIS methods.

We perform an ablation study to discover how visibility features could benefit the detector’s performance, including introducing two hyper-parameters and adopting three different attention mechanisms, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the performance of pedestrian detection could be significantly improved, since the visibility semantic could prompt stronger responses on the heatmap. We compare our BCNet variants with state-of-the-art models on the CityPersons dataset and ETH dataset; results indicate that our detector is effective and achieves a promising performance.

                  Devising effective post-hazard recovery strategies is critical in enhancing the resilience of transportation networks (TNs). However, existing work does not consider the multiclass users’ travel behavior in network functionality quantification and the metaheuristic solution procedures often suffer from extensive computational burden due to the exploration need in large solution space and the expensive functionality quantification. This study develops a bilevel decision-making framework for the resilience-based recovery scheduling of the TN in a mixed traffic environment with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The lower level quantifies the TN's functionality over time considering different travel behavior of CAV and HDV users arisen from their different levels of information perception. The upper level presents a novel deep-ensemble-assisted active learning approach to balance optimization performance and computational cost. This framework can help decision makers better quantify the TN's functionality to support effective recovery scheduling of TN with different mixed traffic scenarios ranging from HDV-only to future CAV-dominant traffic. The optimization approach bears the potential to be extended to solving general large-scale network recovery scheduling problems effectively and efficiently. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a real-world traffic network in Southern California under earthquake considering deterministic and stochastic repair durations.

                  This paper investigates the formation–containment (FC) control problem of networked underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in three-dimensional space. The multi-AUV system under consideration has directed topology, heterogeneous uncertain dynamics and system constraints. To achieve the leaders’ formation and followers’ containment, a two-layer control framework is adopted to decouple the FC problem into two subproblems: reference trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. In the upper layer, a distributed estimator is designed for each AUV to generate a reference trajectory in accordance with the FC objective. Subsequently, a model-free trajectory tracking strategy is developed in the lower layer, where adaptive neural networks combined with an auxiliary compensator are involved not only to approximate the heterogeneous system dynamics, but also to preserve the velocity and input constraints simultaneously. Input-to-state stability is employed to analyze the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed two-layer control protocol.

                  In this paper, we consider trajectory tracking control for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with unknown boundary model uncertainties and external disturbances. The neural networks (NNs) and the sliding mode control (SMC) with a switched adaptive law are combined for the first time. The NNs are used to approximate model uncertainties and external disturbances of ASVs. The parameters of the robust SMC term first increase until the sliding variable reaches a quasi sliding mode which bound is associated with the parameter of the barrier function (BF). Then the BF is selected as the parameter of the robust term for the SMC strategy to estimate the NN approximation error and to constrain the sliding variable inside the predefined quasi sliding mode. One salient feature of our approach is that the robust control parameter is no more than approximation error of NNs in sliding and steady phases of SMC. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate the advantage of the proposed control method.

                  A high fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation may require many days to run, on hundreds of cores. This poses a serious burden, both in terms of time and economic considerations, when repetitions of such simulations may be required (e.g. for the purpose of design optimization). In this paper we present strategies based on (constrained) Bayesian optimization (BO) to alleviate this burden. BO is a numerical optimization technique based on Gaussian processes (GP) that is able to efficiently (with minimal calls to the expensive FSI models) converge towards some globally working admissible design, as gauged using a black box objective function. In this study we present a principled design evolution that moves from FSI model verification, through a series of Bridge Simulations (bringing the verification case incrementally closer to the application), in order that we may identify material properties for an underwater, unmanned, autonomous vehicle (UUAV) sail plane. We are able to achieve fast convergence towards an working admissible design, using a small number of FSI simulations (a dozen at most), even when selecting over several design parameters, and while respecting optimization constraints.

                  Binocular vision target detection algorithms generally require selection of a large number of keypoints, which result in a heavy computational effort for online calculation and the lack of ability to utilize spatial semantic information to full advantage. This paper proposed a stereo priori RCNN based car detection method on point level for autonomous driving. The algorithm combines traditional Region Proposal Network (RPN) with a Mask-branch mechanism, which improves the accuracy of 3D target detection through minimizing luminosity errors, and employs RGB images to provide semantic information for spatial point-clouds. Firstly, the proposed algorithm obtains bounding boxes of left and right images through RPN and classification networks. Then, the prior information of vehicles and branched convolutional neural networks are used to extract wheel features from a feature map. Therefore, the coordinates and orientation of vehicles on bird eye map can be fitted. Afterward, by predicting the keypoints, a 3D bounding box of each vehicle is roughly restored. Then Region of Interest (ROI) is applied on both sides of left and right cameras to minimize the photometric error, so that the precise position and the size of the detection frame are obtained. In the meantime, a Mask-branch mechanism is adopted to achieve a precise semantic segmentation of each ROI. Finally, a 3D bounding box of vehicles is used for point-cloud segmentation, and the semantic information provided by the Mask-branch is exploited to improve the segmentation accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on the Kitti dataset and nuScenes dataset to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

                  In this paper, the issue of global neural finite-time fault-tolerant control (FTC) is investigated for the medium-scale unmanned autonomous helicopter (UAH). To recognize the actuator bias and loss of effectiveness (LOE) faults, a novel fault detection and identification (FDI) strategy is proposed, which consists of a fault detection observer, two adaptive fault observers and a decision-making algorithm. The neural network (NN) technique is employed to deal with the unknown system uncertainty. In view of the backstepping approach and Lyapunov theory, a finite-time FTC scheme is developed to assure that all closed-loop system tracking errors converge to a small range of zero after a limited amount of time. Meanwhile, by integrating a switching mechanism into the control design, the traditional semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability is extended to globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) stability, such that the constraints on initial conditions of the NN controller is moderated. Simulation studies are implemented to demonstrate the usefulness of the presented controller.

                  In this paper, the adaptive prescribed performance tracking control of nonlinear asymmetric input saturated systems in strict-feedback form is addressed under the consideration of model uncertainties and external disturbances. A radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is utilized to handle the model uncertainties. By prescribed performance functions, the transient performance of the system can be guaranteed. The continuous Gaussian error function is represented as an approximation of asymmetric saturation nonlinearity such that the backstepping technique can be leveraged in the control design. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, residual function approximation inaccuracies and external disturbances are compensated by constructed adaptive control laws. As a consequence, all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors bounded by prescribed functions converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. The proposed method is applied to the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with extensive simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This is partly due to a progress in autonomous vehicles technology, and machine learning technique, which as a main component of autonomous vehicle could be implemented for traffic safety enhancement. Wyoming's motorcycle crash fatalities constitute a concern since the count of riders being killed in motorcycle crashes in 2014 was 11% of the total road fatalities in the state. The first step of crash reduction could be achieved through identification of contributory factors to crashes. This could be accomplished by using a right model with high accuracy in predicting crashes. Thus, this study adopted random forest, support vector machine, multivariate adaptive regression splines and binary logistic regression techniques to predict the injury severity outcomes of motorcycle crashes. Even though researchers applied all the aforementioned techniques to model motorcycle injury severities, a comparative analysis to assess the predictive power of such modeling frameworks is limited. Hence, this study contributes to the road safety literature by comparing the performance of the discussed techniques. In this study, Wyoming's motorcycle crash injury severities are modeled as functions of the characteristics that give rise to crashes. Before conducting any analyses, feature reduction was used to identify a best number of predictors to be included in the model. Also to have an unbiased estimation of the performance of different machine learning techniques, 5-fold cross-validation was used for model performance evaluation. Two measure, Area under the curve (AUC), and confusion matrix were used to compare different models' performance. The machine learning results indicate that random forest model outperformed the other models with the least misclassification and higher AUC. It was also revealed that a dichotomous response variable, with fatality and incapacitation injury in one category, along with all other categories in another group would result in a lower misclassification rate than a polychotomous response variable. This might result from the nature of motorcycle crashes, lacking a protection compared with passenger cars, preventing machine learning technique to get trained properly. Moreover, the most important variables identified by the random forest model are those related to the operating speed, resentful other party, traffic volume, truck traffic volume, riding under the influence, horizontal curvature, wide roadway with more than two lanes and rider's age.",autonomous vehicle

                  In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to accurately position wheeled vehicles in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) deprived environments. In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle’s linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet’s performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart (physics model) after any 180 s of travel.

Our DNN model is trained using a novel weakly supervised approach and a gradient-based policy search. On real and simulated scenes and a large set of local planning problems, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing planners with respect to the number of successfully completed tasks. While the path generation time is about 40 ms, the generated paths are smooth and comparable to those obtained from conventional path planners.

                  This paper proposes a method based on the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) dynamic model and complex network theory to effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of the AUV on the vertical plane. First of all, we simplify the AUV’s dynamic model and use a neural network to identify its parameters. The error between the dynamic model’s output and the AUV measurement is employed to build a weighted complex network, which describes the AUV motion condition pattern. Afterwards, the feature matrix is extracted from the complex network. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced to classify the feature matrix, and the three abnormal motion conditions are classified. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of AUV. Compared with other advanced methods, the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved.

Currently, the free span is performed manually in sonar images, with slow and error-prone process, as it depends on human experience and attention. The methodology developed in this paper consists of extracting profiles of pipeline cross sections from the DSM, and then obtaining geometric information about each profile that will be modeled based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) for free span condition classification. The ANN and RF allow evaluating and modeling the relationship between the variables extracted in the profile for the classification of free span condition. The results show that the ANN and RF provide satisfactory results for the free span condition classification with global accuracy of 86.8% and 89.9%, respectively.

                  An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system integrated with a modified faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is proposed to identify various types of structural damage and to map the detected damage a GPS-denied environment. The proposed method reduces the number of false positives significantly using a real-time streaming protocol and multi-processing, particularly in the case of very small cracks in blurry videos due to the UAV vibrations. In comparative studies, the modified Faster R-CNN using ResNet-101 as the base network showed superior performance in detecting small and blurry defects with a mean average precision of 93.31% and mean intersection-over-union of 92.16% in video frames captured by the low-cost autonomous UAV. The autonomous flights of the UAV were tested in a real large-scale parking structure to account for the high wind effects during flight. The UAV successfully followed the desired trajectories, and the Faster R-CNN detected defects accurately.

                  LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving has recently drawn the attention of both academia and industry since it relies upon a sensor that incorporates appealing features like insensitivity to light and capacity to capture the 3D spatial structure of an object along with the continuous reduction of its purchase cost.
                  Furthermore, the emergence of Deep Learning as the means to boost performance in 3D data analysis stimulated the production of a multitude of solutions for LIDAR-based 3D object detection which followed different approaches in an effort to respond effectively to several challenges.
                  In view of this, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LIDAR-based 3D object detection methods wherein an analysis of existing methods is addressed by taking into account a new categorisation that relies upon a common operational pipeline which describes the end-to-end functionality of each method. We next, discuss the existing benchmarking frameworks and present the performance achieved by each method in each of them. Finally, a discussion is presented that provides key insights aiming to capture the essence of current trends in LIDAR-based 3D object detection.

                  Sensor errors are inevitable when measuring the ocean; thus, a reliable dataset of observations requires a quality control (QC) procedure capable of detecting spurious measurements. While manual QC by human experts minimizes errors, it is inefficient to handle large datasets and vulnerable to inconsistencies between different experts. Although automatic QC addresses some of these issues, the traditional methods result in high rates of false positives. Here, I propose a machine learning approach to automatically QC oceanographic data based on the Anomaly Detection technique. Multiple tests are combined into a single multidimensional criterion that learns the behavior of the valid measurements and identifies bad samples as outliers. When applied to 13 years of hydrographic profiles, the Anomaly Detection resulted in the best classification performance, reducing the error by at least 50%. The Anomaly Detection approach introduced here was implemented in the Python package CoTeDe, an open-source framework to quality control oceanographic data.

                  In this paper, we address a problem of vision-based 3D robotic navigation using deep reinforcement learning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub 2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot’s steering settings using the data acquired from the robot’s sensors. Its Vision Module may be based on a built-in convolutional network or a pre-trained TinyYOLO network so that a comparison of various levels of features’ complexity is possible. To enable evaluation of the proposed solution, we prepared a test environment imitating the real conditions. It provides the ability to steer the agent simulating the AUV and calculate values of rewards, used for training the model by evaluating its decisions. We study the solution in terms of the reward function form, the model’s hyperparameters and the exploited camera images processing method, and provide an analysis of the correctness and speed of the model’s functioning. As a result, we obtain a valid model able to steer the robot from the starting point to the destination based on visual cues and inputs from other sensors.

                  In general, infrared (IR) images are generated based on the temperature distribution of the objects of interest by detecting the thermal IR radiation emitted from these objects with the help of sensors. However, the generation of information-specific IR images can enable “intelligent” entities such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence robots with IR detection features to use IR images for exchanging information. In this context, here, we examine a method of realizing IR-image-based information using IR laser projection. With our approach, two- and three-dimensional IR images could be generated by converting near-IR rays to far-IR rays based on the heat generated by a laser. Importantly, the IR signals do not adversely affect humans or interfere with electronic devices. The proposed IR display can be used to exchange specific information among IR-detection-enabled entities without being detected by the human eye. Therefore, it is expected to overcome the problem of light pollution due to the indiscriminate use of displays and human-health-related problems arising from the exposure to electromagnetic wave-based information transmission.

We evaluate and demonstrate with community established benchmarks KITTIMOD, MOT-2017, and MOT-2020. As use-case, we focus on the significance of human-centred visual sensemaking —e.g., involving semantic representation and explainability, question-answering, commonsense interpolation— in safety-critical autonomous driving situations.

                  The localization of self-driving cars is needed for several tasks such as keeping maps updated, tracking objects, and planning. Localization algorithms often take advantage of maps for estimating the car pose. Since maintaining and using several maps is computationally expensive, it is important to analyze which type of map is more adequate for each application. In order to contribute with this analysis, in this work, we compare the accuracy of a particle filter localization when using occupancy, reflectivity, color, or semantic grid maps. To the best of our knowledge, such evaluation is missing in the literature. For building semantic and color grid maps, point clouds from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor are fused with images captured by a front-facing camera. Semantic information is extracted from images with the deep neural network DeepLabv3+. Experiments are performed in varied environments, under diverse conditions of illumination and traffic. Results show that occupancy grid maps lead to more accurate localization, followed by reflectivity grid maps. In most scenarios, the localization with semantic grid maps kept the position tracking without catastrophic losses, but with errors from 2 to 3 times bigger than the previous. Color grid maps led to inaccurate and unstable localization in most scenarios even using a robust metric, the entropy correlation coefficient, for comparing online data and the map.

                  Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) highly depend on the quality of captured underwater images to perform a variety of tasks. However, compared with everyday images taken in air, underwater images are hazy, with color shift, and in relatively low quality, posing significant challenges to available mature vision algorithms to achieve expected performance. There are, currently, two major lines of approaches to tackle these challenges: the physical image formation model-based and the neural-network-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach, where the revised underwater image formation model, i.e., the Akkaynak-Treibitz model, is embedded into the network design for the benefit of combining the advantages of these two approaches. The embedded physical model guides for network learning, and the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted for coefficients estimation. We conduct extensive experiments and compare with state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively on nearly all the available underwater datasets, and our method achieves significant improvements.

                  Marine Autonomous Systems (MAS) operating at sea beyond visual line of sight need to be self-reliant, as any malfunction could lead to loss or pose a risk to other sea users. In the absence of fully automated on-board control and fault detection tools, MAS are piloted and monitored by experts, resulting in high operational costs and limiting the scale of observational fleets that can be deployed simultaneously. Hence, an effective anomaly detection system is fundamental to increase fleet capacity and reliability. In this study, an on-line, remote fault detection system is developed for underwater gliders. Two alternative methods are analysed using time series data: feedforward deep neural networks estimating the glider’s vertical velocity and an autoencoder. The systems are trained using field data from four baseline deployments of Slocum gliders and tested on six deployments of vehicles suffering from adverse behaviour. The methods are able to successfully detect a range of anomalies in the near real time data streams, whilst being able to generalise to different glider configurations. The autoencoder’s error in reconstructing the original signals is the clearest indicator of anomalies. Thus, the autoencoder is a prime candidate to be included into an all-encompassing condition monitoring system for MAS.

                  Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication has recently been considered in 4G and 5G cellular networks. One of the challenging issues in cellular V2V is allocating radio resources to the vehicles. Although previous work have addressed this issue, the fast varying nature of vehicular traffic and its regularities implies that the mobility of the vehicles should be more attended. To this goal, we propose an autonomous geo-based resource selection algorithm that uses deep learning to predict vehicle locations in the future and alleviate the computation and signalling overhead of the cellular infrastructure in contrast to previous geo-based resource allocation algorithms. We utilize the current and the future of vehicle densities in a formulated matching problem to find the optimum assignment of sub-resource pools to geographic areas. Simulation results of a highway with diverse density scenarios and different number of available resources show that the proposed method guarantees a considerable reduction in computation and signalling overhead while in low awareness ranges, it provides up to 10% improvement in Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and the error rate of vehicles compared to the previous Dynamic Geo-based Resource Selection Algorithm (DGRSA). The proposed method also provides up to 15% improvement in PRR and error rate compared to the modified DGRSA, which we have changed to run with an overhead equal to the overhead of our proposed method. Furthermore, our results demonstrate up to 67% and 76% improvement in blocking rate compared to DGRSA and modified DGRSA, respectively.

                  Emergence of communication technologies made the automotive industries across the globe to embrace Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by considerable investments to ensure accident-free travel, reduction of pollution, fuel conservation. ADAS achieves its goals by integrating complex subsystems such as obstacle avoidance, overtaking advice, lane changing assistance, planning shortest routes, parking assistance, automatic gear shifting, etc., using the emerging technologies. This article emphasizes the road safety aspect of the ADAS by exploring Crash Avoidance and Overtaking Advice (CAOA) subsystems. Existing studies have a noticeable lack of connectivity between various aspects of CAOA subsystems. This review deeply explores and connects CAOA subsystems like road geometries, road debris, obstacle avoidance algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), overtaking advice systems, perception challenges of human drivers in various light and weather conditions, driver inattention and misjudgments, vehicle blind-spots, vehicle parameter analysis, performance of vision sensors, in-vehicle computers, driver–vehicle interactions, Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technologies. This article emphasizes the three primary performance metrics of the ADAS, namely accuracy, response time and robustness. Finally, this article discusses a typical functional architecture and gaps identified in existing studies. This article is structured to assist like-minded researchers, who work on CAOA systems for road safety.

                  The first Autonomous Drone Racing (ADR) was launched in the IEEE IROS 2016, and continued to be organised in IROS 2017, 2018 and 2019. Inspired by this competition, other international competitions were launched: the AlphaPilot organised by Lockheed Martin in collaboration with the Drone Racing League, and the Game of Drones, organised by Microsoft and Stanford University. A distinctive feature in the IROS ADR and AlphaPilot competitions is that competing drones had to perform on-board processing only. Hence, along these years, teams have presented novel solutions for on-board processing based on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), microcontrollers and embedded computers such as the Odroid or Intel Stick computers. Motivated by the variety of these solutions, the goal of this work is that of providing the reader with a detail description of the hardware used for the competitions, their benefits as much as limitations, including those microchips used in specialised sensors such as the RGB-D and stereo cameras whose data processing is carried out on the sensor itself. It is expected to conclude that GPU will stand out as the best hardware to compute complex processing on-board, in particular due to the use of deep learning not only to address the gate detection problem, but also to address the control and planning tasks involved in this challenge.

Our method jointly detects human body poses and predicts their intention in a multitask framework. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the precision scores of the state-of-the-art for the task of intention prediction by approximately 20% while running in real-time (5 fps).

                  Road congestion induces significant costs across the world, and road network disturbances, such as traffic accidents, can cause highly congested traffic patterns. If a planner had control over the routing of all vehicles in the network, they could easily reverse this effect. In a more realistic scenario, we consider a planner that controls autonomous cars, which are a fraction of all present cars. We study a dynamic routing game, in which the route choices of autonomous cars can be controlled and the human drivers react selfishly and dynamically. As the problem is prohibitively large, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn a policy for controlling the autonomous vehicles. This policy indirectly influences human drivers to route themselves in such a way that minimizes congestion on the network. To gauge the effectiveness of our learned policies, we establish theoretical results characterizing equilibria and empirically compare the learned policy results with best possible equilibria. We prove properties of equilibria on parallel roads and provide a polynomial-time optimization for computing the most efficient equilibrium. Moreover, we show that in the absence of these policies, high demand and network perturbations would result in large congestion, whereas using the policy greatly decreases the travel times by minimizing the congestion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs deep reinforcement learning to reduce congestion by indirectly influencing humans’ routing decisions in mixed-autonomy traffic.

                  Ever since the emergence of ride-sourcing services, the spatial–temporal pricing problem has been a hot research topic in both the transportation and management fields. The difficulty lies in simultaneously obtaining the optimal multivariable solution for spatial pricing and sequential solution for dynamic pricing, considering the heterogeneity, dynamics, and imbalance of on-demand ride supply/demand. Due to this problem's complexity, most studies have simplified the modeling setting and omitted the complicated matching and waiting process between drivers and passengers. To go beyond the existing models, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning enhanced agent-based modeling and simulation (RL-ABMS) system to reveal the complex mechanism in the ride-sourcing system and tackle the problem of spatial–temporal pricing for a ride-sourcing platform. The reinforcement learning approach proximal policy optimization (PPO) is implemented in the RL-ABMS system, where two feed-forward neural networks are built as critic and actor. The critic judges the goodness of the current state, and the actor generates the optimal pricing strategy.Compared with the fixed pricing strategy, the experimental results on a real-world urban network show that dynamic pricing raises the platform's profit to 1.25 times, and spatial–temporal pricing even raises it to 1.85 times. Besides, the number of idle drivers/vehicles has significantly dropped under the spatial–temporal pricing strategy, which indicates that our proposed strategy has a remarkable effect on coordinating supply and demand in the ride-sourcing market.

                  This work presents DMPC (Data-and Model-Driven Predictive Control) to solve control problems in which some of the constraints or parts of the objective function are known, while others are entirely unknown to the controller. It is assumed that there is an exogenous “black box” system, e.g. a machine learning technique, that predicts the value of the unknown functions for a given trajectory. DMPC (1) provides an approach to merge both the model-based and black-box systems; (2) can cope with very little data and is sample efficient, building its solutions based on recently generated trajectories; and (3) improves its cost in each iteration until converging to an optimal trajectory, typically needing only a few trials even for nonlinear dynamics and objectives. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is presented, proving that the quality of the trajectory does not worsen with each new iteration. We apply the DMPC algorithm to the motion planning of an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear dynamics.

                  Wireless communication systems play an essential role in everyday life situations and enable a wide range of location-based services to their users. The imminent adoption of 5G networks worldwide and the future establishment of next-generation wireless networks will allow various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, connected robotics, and most recently, crowd monitoring for fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. In this context, radio localization techniques have become an essential tool to provide solid performance for mobile positioning systems, through increased accuracy or less computational time. With this in mind, we propose a trilateration-based approach using machine learning (ML) and sequential least-square programming (SLSQP) optimization to estimate the outdoor position of mobile terminals in cellular networks. The ML technique employed is the 
                        k
                     -nearest neighbors (
                        k
                     -NN). The optimization methods analyzed are Nelder–Mead (NM), genetic algorithms (GA), and SLSQP. Different environments (noise-free and noisy) and network scenarios (different numbers of base stations) are considered to evaluate the approaches. Numerical results indicate that the 
                        k
                     -NN/SLSQP technique has similar accuracy compared to the 
                        k
                     -NN/GA with eight generations. Both perform better than 
                        k
                     -NN/NM in all scenarios and environments. When comparing computational times, our proposal is considerably more time-efficient. Aside from that, SLSQP computational time is less affected by network scenarios with more base stations in comparison with GA. That feature is significant considering the ultra-dense base station deployment forecasted for the next-generation cellular networks.

                  This study aims to identify how environmental, technological, and social factors influence the adoption of Industry 4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing. The Industry 4.0 era has brought a breakthrough in advanced technologies in fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless technology, fully autonomous vehicles, 3D printing and so on. In this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. In doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework is used to explore the applicability of Industry 4.0. A conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations. The results further indicated that leadership support acts as a countable factor to moderate such an adoption.

                  Identifying emerging technologies has been of long-standing interest to many scholars and practitioners. Previous studies have introduced methods to capture the concept of emergence from bibliographic records, including the recently proposed Technology Emergence Indicator (Carley et al. 2018). This indicator method has shown to be applicable to various technological fields. However, the indicator uses a limited time window, which can overlook the potential long-term evolution of emerging technologies. Moreover, the existing method suffers from interpretability, because it can be difficult to understand the context in which identified emerging terms are used. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the Technology Emergence Indicator that addresses these issues. In doing so, we examine emerging topics within the field of autonomous vehicles technologies during the period of 1991-2018, guided by a proposition about the long-term diffusion of an emerging technology topic. The results show that different autonomous vehicle technology topics emerge during each of the three 10-year periods under analysis, including an initial period of understanding the surrounding environment and path planning, a second period marked by DARPA Grand Challenge motivated factors associated with the urban environment and communication technologies, and a third period relating to machine learning and object detection. This association with certain emerging technology topics in each decade is also characterized by different trajectories of continued or cyclical carryover across the decades. The results suggest a methodology that practitioners can use in examining research areas to understand which topics are likely to persist into the future.

                  Object detection has been one of the most active topics in computer vision for the past years. Recent works have mainly focused on pushing the state-of-the-art in the general-purpose COCO benchmark. However, the use of such detection frameworks in specific applications such as autonomous driving is yet an area to be addressed. This study presents an enhanced 2D object detector based on Faster R-CNN that is better suited for the context of autonomous vehicles. Two main aspects are improved: the anchor generation procedure and the performance drop in minority classes. The default uniform anchor configuration is not suitable in this scenario due to the perspective projection of the vehicle cameras. Therefore, we propose a perspective-aware methodology that divides the image into key regions via clustering and uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the base anchors for each of them. Furthermore, we add a module that enhances the precision of the second-stage header network by including the spatial information of the candidate regions proposed in the first stage. We also explore different re-weighting strategies to address the foreground-foreground class imbalance, showing that the use of a reduced version of focal loss can significantly improve the detection of difficult and underrepresented objects in two-stage detectors. Finally, we design an ensemble model to combine the strengths of the different learning strategies. Our proposal is evaluated with the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the most extensive and diverse up to date. The results demonstrate an average accuracy improvement of 6.13% mAP when using the best single model, and of 9.69% mAP with the ensemble. The proposed modifications over the Faster R-CNN do not increase computational cost and can easily be extended to optimize other anchor-based detection frameworks.

                  This paper is concerned with distributed coordinated control of networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) guided by multiple parameterized paths. The model of each ASV is subject to fully unknown kinetics, including environment disturbances, model uncertainties, and unknown input coefficients. A coordinated control method is presented for multiple ASVs to achieve a containment formation based on event-triggered mechanisms. Specifically, an event-triggered kinematic control law is firstly developed based on aperiodic communication. The desired path during the triggering interval is predicted by the last event-triggered velocity. Then, an event-triggered kinetic control law is developed, a third-order linear tracking differentiator is introduced to take the derivative of the kinematic control law, and the control input is updated only if the predefined event is triggered. A concurrent-learning-based neural predictor is constructed by using historical data such that model uncertainties and unknown input coefficients are identified simultaneously. Next, an event-triggered path update law is constructed by using a path-maneuvering design and the aperiodic information received from the network. The proposed method ensures the input-to-state stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed coordinated control for networked ASVs by using event-triggered mechanisms and concurrent-learning-based neural predictors.

                  This paper addresses the three-dimensional tracking and stabilization problems simultaneously for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subjected to parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, unmeasured states and input saturation. A modified error state formulation is introduced to produce auxiliary virtual controls for the underactuated kinematics. A new high-gain observer is proposed to estimate unavailable velocities which doesn't need the position and orientation of AUVs to be bounded. Based on the backstepping technique and combinations of high-gain observer and radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN) approximations, the kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed to force underactuated AUVs to track a time-varying trajectory or/and a stationary point, and guarantees the tracking errors convergent to a bounded neighborhood of the origin. Some comparative simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme.

                  Social interest in autonomous navigation systems for autonomous ships is also increasing. For a robust autonomous navigation system, the location, speed, and direction of the ship and other ships must be identified in real time, and collision avoidance should be performed at an appropriate time by considering the collision risk. In this study, we proposed a collision avoidance method that quantitatively assesses the collision risk and then generates an avoidance path. First, to assess the collision risk, a collision risk assessment method based on the ship domain and the closest point of approach (CPA) was proposed. The ship domain is created with an asymmetric shape considering manoeuvring performance and the COLREGs. The CPA is used to assess quantitative collision risk value. Subsequently, a path generation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was proposed to determine the avoidance time and to generate an avoidance path complying the COLREGs for the most dangerous ship in terms of collision risk. The information of own ship and target ship such as location, speed, heading, collision risk is used as the input state, and the rudder angle of own ship is set as the output action of the DRL. The cost function related to the path following and the collision avoidance is defined as the reward of the DRL-based collision avoidance method. Additionally, the DRL modes are defined to navigate the flexible avoidance path by changing the ratio between the path following and the collision avoidance. To verify the proposed method, we compared the collision avoidance method with the A* algorithm, which is a traditional path planning algorithm, and analyzed the results for various scenarios. The proposed method reliably avoided collisions through flexible paths for complex and unexpected changes in situations compared to the A* algorithm.

                  Improving the autopilot capability of ships is particularly important to ensure the safety of maritime navigation.The unmanned surface vessel (USV) with autopilot capability is a development trend of the ship of the future. The objective of this paper is to investigate the path planning problem of USVs in uncertain environments, and a path planning strategy unified with a collision avoidance function based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. A Deep Q-learning network (DQN) is used to continuously interact with the visually simulated environment to obtain experience data, so that the agent learns the best action strategies in the visual simulated environment. To solve the collision avoidance problems that may occur during USV navigation, the location of the obstacle ship is divided into four collision avoidance zones according to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). To obtain an improved DRL algorithm, the artificial potential field (APF) algorithm is utilized to improve the action space and reward function of the DQN algorithm. A simulation experiments is utilized to test the effects of our method in various situations. It is also shown that the enhanced DRL can effectively realize autonomous collision avoidance path planning.

                  This paper investigates the problem of cooperative path-following control for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of the model uncertainties, environmental disturbance, actuator failures and limited communication. A novel intelligent controller is designed for autonomous surface vessels to track priori parameterized reference paths so that the desired formation can be achieved. In the algorithm, the model uncertainties are estimated by neural networks. By virtue of the dynamic surface control technique, the inherent problem ”explosion of complexity” occurred in the traditional Backstepping design framework is avoided. A concise adaptive law is developed to compensate the upper bound of the weight matrix for neural networks, rather than the whole weight matrix. Furthermore, the event-triggered mechanism is embedded into the cooperative controller to reduce the frequency of inter-vehicle communication. The cooperative controller is updated only at the instant when the threshold condition is violated. By using the Lyapunov theory, both the semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and fault-tolerance capability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Finally, numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

                  Internet of Things(IoT) facilitates key technologies that rely on sensing, communication and processing in daily routines. As an IoT-enabled paradigm, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) can offer more possibilities for data collection to support various IoT applications and services. As an extension, MCS can be used for data gathering amid COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Bridging Artificial Intelligence and IoT can achieve not only maintaining low infection rates of COVID-19 but can also facilitate an effective rapid testing strategy to reduce community spread. In this research, an intelligent strategy to deploy autonomous vehicle-based mobile testing facilities is proposed to enable early detection of infected cases based upon MCS data acquired through smart devices via wireless communications such as Wifi, LTE and 5G. To this end, a Self Organizing Feature Map is designed to manage MCS-based data for planning of the autonomous mobile assessment centers. Pre-identified zero-day locations and worst-case scenario are considered to determine the best combination for MCS participation rate and budget limitations. Numerical results demonstrate that once 30% of MCS participants are recruited, it becomes possible to cover the pre-identified zero-day locations and enable detection of infected cases under the worst case scenario to determine the AV routes more efficiently than other options for a certain number of neurons in SOFM. The worst-case scenario demonstrates that 30% participant rate ensures detection of infected cases in 27 days for 81 stops even infected cases are outside of the autonomous vehicle testing coverage.

                  Building representative real world drive cycles is an important component in the modelling of emissions, battery health of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. All these applications are sensitive to the transients and diversity present in real world driving patterns, which are not adequately captured by current approaches. To address this lacuna, we use clustering techniques involving time-series (shape) based distances on the raw data directly to obtain representative sets of real world drive cycles. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using experimental data from a fleet of eight motorcycles run across five locations in India. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance based clustering gives optimal results. We give theoretical and experimental justification for our constructions. We believe that the constructed drive cycles using the proposed approach would help in assessing the impact of various policies aimed at building eco-friendly transportation systems.

                  The underwater environment poses a complex problem for developing control systems for underwater manipulators. Modeling the system is a complicated and costly process due to the highly nonlinear dynamics and the presence of unknown hydrodynamical effects. Furthermore, manipulators are usually deployed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) which further influence and change the dynamics of the arm. This is aggravated in underwater operations where manipulating different objects is necessary. These diverse manipulation tasks introduce external disturbances to the system and can lead to a fast degradation of the control system performance. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive controller for underwater robot manipulators that have to handle varying payloads with different masses, geometries, and buoyant forces. The proposed control strategy utilizes a data-driven model of the system in an optimal control formulation based on neural networks. Moreover, we developed an online tuning strategy, based on the adaptive interaction theory, which allows the gains of the controller to be updated online with respect to a set of performance metrics. Experiments were performed with the robotic arm manipulating a variety of payloads while mounted on both a fixed base and a free-floating vehicle. We present a number of simulated and experimental results that illustrate the benefits of the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparative study against a classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) demonstrates the benefits of our adaptive proposal.

By incorporating in-situ buoy observations, outputs were found to match observations at a test location more closely than the corresponding SWAN model. Furthermore, the required computational time reduced by a factor of 100.

                  This paper addresses a dual closed-loop fast integral terminal sliding mode control method of a multi-underactuated AUV formation system with uncertain model parameters and environmental disturbances. Different from the traditional sliding mode control method, this technique can not only keep the formation stable, but also significantly overcomes the problem that the formation tracking errors of the traditional method may not converge to zero in finite time. Then, an adaptive radial basis function (RBF) neural network controller is incorporated with a conditional integrator to deal with the uncertain model parameters, approximation errors and environmental disturbances in practical multi-AUV systems. And also the proposed controller is continuous with the property of chattering restraining. A virtual leader is adopted on the basis of the leader-following strategy to improve the robustness of the formation system and prevent the problem of formation collapse caused by the failure of the leader AUV. Moreover, the rigorous stability analysis based on Lyapunov method and numerical simulations demonstrate tracking errors converge to 0 in finite time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller: the AUV formation can track the desired trajectory accurately with

                  This paper investigates the event-triggered tracking control of fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the vertical plane. Specifically, this paper studies the ETC in the sensor-to-controller channel, where the X-Z coordinates and the pitch angle are transmitted in an event-triggered manner. The greater communication saving is ensured. Additionally, the recently-raised problem of “jumps of virtual control laws” is solved by establishing an event-triggered adaptive neural observer. This observer can offer the benefit of state recovery, which conforms to the nautical practice. As the observer is co-located with the controller, a succinct triggering condition is devised to avoid the “Zeno” behavior and co-located with the sensors. To achieve the optimization of the long-term tracking performance, the reinforcement learning (RL) technique is performed by using the critic-actor method with the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs). The critic NN approximates the performance index and is transferred as the reinforcement signal to the actor NN, which accounts for the uncertainties. The closed-loop stability is analyzed based on the observer-based tracking errors, and all of them are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, a numerical experiment substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Application of an automated classification workflow requires manually identified specimens to be supplied for training and validating the model. These training and validation datasets are generally generated by partitioning the available manual identified specimens; typical ratios of training to validation dataset sizes are 75:25 or 80:20. However, this approach does not facilitate the desired scalability, which would require models to successfully classify specimens in hundreds of thousands to millions of images after training on a relatively small subset of manually identified specimens. A second problem is related to the ‘class imbalance’, where natural community structure means that fewer specimens of rare morphotypes are available for model training. We investigated the impact of independent variation of the training and validation dataset sizes on the performance of a convolutional neural network classifier on benthic invertebrates visible in a very large set of seabed photographs captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory. We tested the impact of increasing training dataset size on specimen classification in a single validation dataset, and then tested the impact of increasing validation set size, evaluating ecological metrics in addition to computer vision metrics. Computer vision metrics (recall, precision, F1-score) indicated that classification improved with increasing training dataset size. In terms of ecological metrics, the number of morphotypes recorded increased, while diversity decreased with increasing training dataset size. Variation and bias in diversity metrics decreased with increasing training dataset size. Multivariate dispersion in apparent community composition was reduced, and bias from expert-derived data declined with increasing training dataset size. In contrast, classification success and resulting ecological metrics did not differ significantly with varying validation dataset sizes. Thus, the selection of an appropriate training dataset size is key to ensuring robust automated classifications of benthic invertebrates in seabed photographs, in terms of ecological results, and validation may be conducted on a comparatively small dataset with confidence that similar results will be obtained in a larger production dataset. In addition, our results suggest that automated classification of less common morphotypes may be feasible, providing that the overall training dataset size is sufficiently large. Thus, tactics for reducing class imbalance in the training dataset may produce improvements in the resulting ecological metrics.",autonomous vehicle

                  This paper presents a distributed event-driven adaptive formation control strategy for networked uncertain nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in three-dimensional space. It is assumed that the leader information is only transmitted to a subset of AUV followers under a directed graph and the nonlinearities of the AUV dynamics are unknown. A distributed error transformation method is presented to address the distributed formation tracking problem of AUV followers in three-dimensional space. Then, a distributed event-driven adaptive control method using neural networks and stabilizing auxiliary signals is developed to ensure the stability of the event-driven closed-loop system and accomplish three-dimensional formation tracking in the Lyapunov stability sense. Additionally, it is shown that Zeno behavior does not occur in the resulting event-triggering strategy. A simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical methodology.

Due to its flexibility, pharmaceutical 3DP presents innumerable options during formulation development that generally require expert navigation. Leveraging AI within pharmaceutical 3DP removes the need for human expertise, as optimal process parameters can be accurately predicted by machine learning. AI can also be incorporated into a pharmaceutical 3DP ‘Internet of Things’, moving the personalised production of medicines into an intelligent, streamlined, and autonomous pipeline. Supportive infrastructure, such as The Cloud and blockchain, will also play a vital role. Crucially, these technologies will expedite the use of pharmaceutical 3DP in clinical settings and drive the global movement towards personalised medicine and Industry 4.0.

                  This study proposed a fault diagnosis method based on deep learning and attention mechanism for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Firstly, a data attention mechanism is proposed to introduce dynamic weighting coefficients of monitoring variables to realize dynamic decorrelation. Then, the automatic feature engineering is realized by a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to acquire the time dynamic characteristics of monitoring variables. Finally, fault detection is implemented via multi-layer perceptron (MLP). With respect to fault identification, this study embeds a spatial attention mechanism in the fault detection network to capture the semantic relationship between monitoring variables and faults, and fault identification result can be obtained by parsing this semantic relationship. We present a new loss function and training strategy for cooperation between the fault detection and identification tasks. The proposed method is validated on the monitoring data of Qianlong-2 AUV obtained during the mission in the South China Sea, which shows the effectiveness and superiority of the method.

                  In the literature, city logistics in terms of last mile delivery on the e-commerce market is quite new area of research that is not thoroughly investigated. It can be observed that there are many papers discussing various topics from the perspective of different groups of stakeholders such as residents, governments, shippers, receivers, transport companies (CEP), and others. However, there is no holistic approach covering the presented field of research. Therefore, the paper’s purpose is identification of trends in sustainable last mile delivery on e-commerce market in cities from the perspective of various stakeholders. The research method that serves the paper’s purpose is systematic literature review in the above-presented field performed through traditional method and machine learning (VOSviewer). In order to conduct critical analysis of published sources, the Web of Science and Scopus databases were applied. The paper's added value is a comprehensive approach to sustainable city logistics of last mile delivery that includes all stakeholders' perspectives and the identification of trends in this area. During the critical literature analysis, authors identified the relations between stakeholders, the fields of the research, and the trends for developing sustainable last mile delivery on the e-commerce market. It should be noted, that recent articles discuss newer technological and organization solutions, such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, crowd-shipping, parcel lockers, and concentrate on the behavior analysis of e-customers.

The final objective is offering growers a practical system to make decisions about water management, especially for arid climatic conditions. The monitoring AGV was entirely developed within this research context, and as a result, it is a machine specifically designed to endure off-road conditions and harsh environments. The autonomous vehicle served as a massive, non-invasive, and on-the-go data collector robotic platform. The sensors used for measuring the relevant field variables were two spectral reflectance sensors (SRS), an infrared radiometer, and an on-board weather sensor. The collected data were displayed on comprehensible grid maps using the Local Tangent Plane (LTP) coordinate system. The proposed model has a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.69, and results from combining six parameters: the canopy and air temperatures (as the temperature difference), the relative humidity, the altitude difference, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). The strongest relationships found in this study were between the temperature difference and PRI, with an R2 of 0.75, and the temperature difference with the leaf water potential with an R2 of 0.61. The practical use of these high-resolution maps includes irrigation scheduling and harvest zoning for sorting grape quality, with a further use as inputs to complex artificial intelligence algorithms considering larger areas or complementing airborne data. Future improvements to make the models more robust and versatile will entail considering additional variables, locations, or grapevine cultivars, and even other crops grown in vertical trellis systems.",autonomous vehicle

                  Imitation learning (IL) is a popular method used to train machine learning models that are capable of acting on their environment based on expert examples. Two types of IL models are inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and behavioral cloning (BC). Models trained under IRL traditionally perform better than those trained under BC due to compounding covariate shift associated with the latter, which typically requires algorithms such as DAGGer to help compensate for this. More recently, however, deep learning architectures with increased generalization performance have been developed, which may help to alleviate the problem of compounding covariate shift and allow researchers to take advantage of the simplicity of BC. Despite these developments, recent studies on BC in sub-scale autonomous robots employ relatively primitive convolutional networks without such tools as batch normalization and skip connections, and it is difficult to judge their networks’ performance relative to others due to drastically different training and testing conditions. Here, we examine how an array of artificial neural networks, chosen to reflect more recent architectural choices available, behave in a highly controlled IL task – navigating around a small, indoor racetrack – upon being embedded in a sub-scale RC vehicle as an end-to-end steering system. For our main findings, we report the lap completion rate and path smoothness of each network under the exact same conditions as it controls the vehicle on the track. To supplement these findings, we also measure each network’s bias toward the distribution of the training actions and develop a method to highlight regions of a given input image that are deemed ‘important’ to a given network. We observe that most of the more recent neural networks perform reasonably well during testing, as opposed to the more primitive networks which did not perform as well. For these reasons and others, we identify VGG-16 and AlexNet – out of the networks tested here – as attractive candidate architectures for such tasks.

                  The emergence of mobile edge computing provides an efficient and stable computing platform for intelligent applications of autonomous vehicles, and deep neural network (DNN) based tasks collaborative inference through joint device-edge is considered an effective way to reduce latency. However, the computing resources allocated to the vehicle are dynamic as the number of requesters changes due to the limitation of edge server resources, which causes the best partition point of the DNN is not fixed. In this paper, we consider a dynamic resource allocation scheme to select the best partition point of DNN inference tasks by vehicle-edge collaborative computing. Specifically, the latency constrained DNN tasks of vehicles are partially offloaded to edge at the granularity of DNN layers. Considering the heterogeneity of vehicular computing capabilities and multiple DNN inference tasks, we formulate an optimization problem for dynamic resource allocation and automatically select the best partition point to minimize the overall latency of all vehicles, which is NP-hard. Then we design a chemical reaction optimization based algorithm for low complexity to solve the problem. The results of extensive evaluations illustrate that our proposed scheme is superior to other baseline schemes in terms of overall latency, and with lower failure rate.

                  The classification of natural terrain ahead of an autonomous vehicle can help it make decisions regarding the traversability of various paths, but remains an open research problem. Despite the explosion in popularity of deep learning networks,there is still little work available on informed neural network design procedures for specific tasks such as terrain image classification, save through performance measures. A related problem is understanding features of a dataset that lead to difficulties in separating classes of images from one another. This research proposes an algorithm and accompanying analytical procedure to characterize such image classification difficulties; identifying what makes some images easily distinguishable as their class and what makes others readily confused with other classes. This is achieved by learning reduced-dimensionality representations of the input data, constructing a convex hull of class members in the reduced dimensionality representation, then examining between-class overlap within each space, incrementally increasing the dimensionality until overlap is eliminated. Summarizing the between-class overlap statistics reveals trends and anomalies that can be linked back to visual features, characteristic of the original data. Case studies are presented of insights identified through selected example analyses: relative intensities of terrain classes from images taken by Mars rovers, and the impact of color gradients in separating sand from bedrock in color images of terrain. Such insights are discussed as steps toward a more directed approach to designing neural networks for image classification.

                  The future challenge for field robots is to increase the level of autonomy towards long distance (>1 km) and duration (>1h) applications. One of the key technologies is the ability to accurately estimate the properties of the traversed terrain to optimize onboard control strategies and energy efficient path-planning, ensuring safety and avoiding possible immobilization conditions that would lead to mission failure. Two main hypotheses are put forward in this research. The first hypothesis is that terrain can be effectively detected by relying exclusively on the measurement of quantities that pertain to the robot-ground interaction, i.e., on proprioceptive signals. Therefore, no visual or depth information is required. Then, artificial deep neural networks can provide an accurate and robust solution to the classification problem of different terrain types. Under these hypotheses, sensory signals are classified as time series directly by a Recurrent Neural Network or by a Convolutional Neural Network in the form of higher-level features or spectrograms resulting from additional processing. In both cases, results obtained from real experiments show comparable or better performance when contrasted with standard Support Vector Machine with the additional advantage of not requiring an a priori definition of the feature space.

                  The AUV must be capable of fault diagnosis if it is to perform tasks in complex environments without human assistance. However, the current fault diagnosis methods for AUV lack of manual experience and accuracy, leading to the lack of fault handling capacity. Different from the traditional model-based fault diagnosis, we propose a new model-free fault diagnosis method characterized by a deep learning-based algorithm, which is a new Sequence Convolutional Neural Network (SeqCNN) that learns the patterns between state data and fault type. More specifically, the proposed SeqCNN aims to extract global feature and local feature from state data and classify the extracted information into different fault types, and can convert two-stage diagnosis mode into a single-stage one. Compared to the traditional model-based diagnosis, it can significantly reduce the time-consuming burden, simplify the diagnosis procedure and improve the efficiency. The effectiveness of SeqCNN was validated by a practical experiment on a small quadrotor AUV ‘Haizhe’. The results indicate that the proposed SeqCNN can solve the problem of fault detection and fault isolation in single-stage diagnosis mode and that its accuracy is far superior to that of other deep learning diagnosis algorithms.

                  Identifying systems with high-dimensional inputs and outputs, such as systems measured by video streams, is a challenging problem with numerous applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a novel non-linear state-space identification method starting from high-dimensional input and output data. Multiple computational and conceptual advances are combined to handle the high-dimensional nature of the data. An encoder function, represented by a neural network, is introduced to learn a reconstructability map to estimate the model states from past inputs and outputs. This encoder function is jointly learned with the dynamics. Furthermore, multiple computational improvements, such as an improved reformulation of multiple shooting and batch optimization, are proposed to keep the computational time under control when dealing with high-dimensional and large datasets. We apply the proposed method to a video stream of a simulated environment of a controllable ball in a unit box. The study shows low simulation error with excellent long term prediction capability of the model obtained using the proposed method.

                  Automated driving applications require accurate vehicle specific models to precisely predict and control the motion dynamics. However, modern vehicles have a wide array of digital and mechatronic components that are difficult to model, manufactures do not disclose all details required for modelling and even existing models of subcomponents require coefficient estimation to match the specific characteristics of each vehicle and their change over time. Hence, it is attractive to use data-driven modelling to capture the relevant vehicle dynamics and synthesise model-based control solutions. In this paper, we address identification of the steering system of an autonomous car based on measured data. We show that the underlying dynamics are highly nonlinear and challenging to be captured, necessitating the use of data-driven methods that fuse the approximation capabilities of learning and the efficiency of dynamic system identification. We demonstrate that such a neural network based subspace-encoder method can successfully capture the underlying dynamics while other methods fall short to provide reliable results.

                  The ongoing developments of artificial intelligence have made the self-driving car industry enter the phase of extensive road testing in recent years. However, in China, research on self-driving car legislation is basically nonexistent. This paper focuses on comprehensively analyzing the self-driving car legislation and testing process based on the latest provisions in both China and the United States and conducts a comparative study. This study gives a detailed analysis of legislation trends in the legal field and provides practical suggestions for promoting the self-driving car industry in China as well as for that in other countries.

                  The connectivity aspect of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) is beneficial because it facilitates dissemination of traffic-related information to vehicles through Vehicle-to-External (V2X) communication. Onboard sensing equipment including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize the traffic environment in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited by their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed, safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions including lane change) and long-term (route choice). Current literature provides useful information on CAV control approaches that use only local information sensed from the proximate traffic environment but relatively little guidance on how to fuse this information with that obtained from downstream sources and from different time stamps, and how to use the fused information to enhance CAV movements. In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the study carried out a case study. The case study demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.

                  The last decade witnessed a great development of automated driving vehicles (ADVs) and vehicle intelligence. The significant increment of machine intelligence poses a new challenge to the community, which is the collaboration between human drivers and vehicle autonomy. As vehicle autonomy is gaining more control authority, the roles that human drivers can play in the future need to be further clarified. In this study, literature review and perspectives on the human behaviors and cognition (HBC) for ADVs toward human-autonomy (H-A) collaboration are proposed. First, the H-A collaboration basics and key factors are reviewed. Then, the HBC issues in driver behavior modeling and understanding are discussed. Specifically, two key factors are reviewed, which are human trust and situation awareness (SA). Next, HBC in two H-A collaboration-enabled vehicle control methods, namely, shared control and take-over control, are analyzed. It is shown that the human-centered collaboration strategy that integrates driver states will largely increase the acceptance of the ADVs. Then, the HBC issues in the design of human-machine-interface (HMI) for future autonomous and collaboration-enabled ADVs are discussed. Last, challenges and future works for H-A collaboration on ADVs are analyzed to contribute to the development of understandable, trustable, and acceptable ADVs.

                  In this paper, a composite learning tracking control scheme is developed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of unknown dynamics and time-varying disturbances. Line-of-sight (LOS) tracking control is employed to handle the underactuation of AUVs. The unknown dynamics of the AUVs are approximated by adaptive neural networks (NNs). The serial-parallel estimation models are built to obtain the prediction errors. Both the prediction errors and the tracking errors are employed to design the composite weights updating law. Nonlinear disturbance observers based on composite learning control are constructed to estimate time-varying disturbances. The stability analysis via the Lyapunov method indicates that the uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals of the AUV trajectory tracking close-loop control system. The simulation results on an AUV verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed composite learning tracking control scheme.

                  Human action recognition using various sensors is a mandatory component of autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, and ambient living environments. A particular interest is the detection and recognition of falls. In this paper, we propose the use of temporal convolution networks guided by knowledge distillation for detecting falls and recognizing types of falls using accelerometer data. Tri-axial accelerometers attached to the body measure the acceleration of the body joints when an action occurs. These data are used for pattern analysis and body action recognition. We demonstrate the existence of biases caused by soft biometrics when recognizing human body actions. We introduce a causal network to capture the influences of biases on system performance and illustrate how knowledge distillation can be applied to mitigate the bias effect.

                  In the multiple fields covered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), path planning is undoubtedly one of the issues that cover a wide range of research lines. To be able to find an optimal solution, which allows one or several vehicles to establish a safe and effective way to reach a final state from an initial state, is a challenge that continues to be studied today. The increasingly widespread use of autonomous vehicles, both aerial and ground-based, make path planning an essential aspect for incorporating these systems into an endless number of applications. Besides, in recent years, the use of Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) has spread, consisting of both Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), gaining versatility and robustness in their operation. The possibility of using heterogeneous robotic teams allows tackling, autonomously, and simultaneously, a wide range of tasks with different characteristics in the same environment. For this purpose, path planning becomes a crucial aspect and, for this reason, this work aims to offer a general vision of trajectory planning, to establish a comparison between the methods and algorithms present in the literature for the resolution of this problem within MRS, and finally, to show the applicability of these methods in different areas, together with the importance of these methods for achieving autonomous and safe navigation of different types of vehicles.

                  Understanding drivers’ behavioral characteristics is critical for the design of decision-making modules in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs). Current relevant studies are mainly based on supervised learning methods which involve extensive human efforts in model development. This paper proposed a framework for automatic descriptive driving pattern extraction from driving sequence data using unsupervised algorithms. Based on the Bayesian multivariate linear regression model, two unsupervised algorithms were utilized to segment driving sequences into fragments. Three extended latent Dirichlet allocation models were applied to cluster the fragments into multiple descriptive driving patterns. The collected driving data from a naturalistic driving experiment was applied to examine the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Results show that the unsupervised segmentation algorithms could help effectively detect the switch characteristics between two continuous driving maneuvers along time, and the clustered patterns could effectively describe the characteristics of each driving maneuver. The proposed unsupervised framework provides an effective and efficient data mining solution to facilitating deep and comprehensive understanding on drivers’ behavioral characteristics, which will benefit the development of AVs and ADASs.

                  This paper proposes a novel learning-based framework to realize quadrotor autonomous obstacle avoidance with monocular vision. The framework adopts a two-stage architecture, consisting of a sensing module and a decision module. The sensing module trained in an unsupervised manner can extract depth information from the on-board camera image. Moreover, the decision module uses dueling double deep recurrent Q-learning to eliminate the adverse effects of the on-board monocular camera’s limited observation capacity while choosing practical obstacle avoidance action. The framework has two advantages: (1) it enables the quadrotor to realize autonomous obstacle avoidance without any prior environment information or labeled datasets for training, and (2) its model can be easily updated while facing new application scenarios. The experiments in several different simulation scenes show that the trained framework outperforms a high passing rate in crowded environments and a good generalization ability for transformed scenarios.

                  With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies, more and more applications, such as autonomous vehicles and tele-medicine, become more sensitive to network latency and accuracy, which require routing schemes to be more flexible and efficient. In order to meet such urgent need, learning-based routing strategies are emerging as strong candidate solutions, with the advantages of high flexibility and accuracy. These strategies can be divided into two categories, centralized and distributed, enjoying the advantages of high precision and high efficiency, respectively. However, routing becomes more complex in dynamic IoT network, where the link connections and access states are time-varying, hence these learning-based routing mechanisms are required to have the capability to adapt to network changes in real time. In this paper, we designed and implemented both centralized and distributed Reinforcement Learning-based Routing schemes combined with Multi-optimality routing criteria (RLR-M). By conducting a series of experiments, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the results and arrived at the conclusion that the centralized is better suited to cope with dynamic networks due to its faster reconvergence (2.2 
                        ×
                      over distributed), while the distributed is better positioned to handle with large-scale networks through its high scalability (1.6 
                        ×
                      over centralized). Moreover, the multi-optimality routing scheme is implemented through model fusion, which is more flexible than traditional strategies and as such is better placed to meet the needs of IoT.

                  Actuator is critical component of the AUV, the actuator's fault diagnosis is of great significance to ensure the safe operation of the AUV. Therefore, it is of great important to investigate an intelligent method of AUV. In this research, a diagnostic network combining wide convolutional neural network (WDCNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Firstly, the reliability of the diagnostic network when sailing downstream and upstream is considered, and a network with strong generalization ability is found structure. Secondly, the model does not rely on any domain adaptation algorithm or require information of the target domain. It is verified that WDCNN can effectively extract the deep features of data with high diagnostic accuracy and strong anti noise ability, and ELM can effectively increase the generalization ability of the model. The network can be applied to AUV actuator fault diagnosis.

                  Quadrotor system is subject to multiple disturbances, including both internal and external effects (e.g. wind gusts, coupling effects, and unmodeled dynamics). For example, severe wind disturbances may significantly degrade trajectory tracking during the flight of autonomous aerial vehicles, or even cause loss of control or failure of a tracking mission. This paper introduces a robust hybrid control system, including a linear Strictly Negative Imaginary (SNI) controller and an adaptive nonlinear Neural-Fuzzy control law, to enable high-precision trajectory tracking tasks for a quadcopter drone. Based on a parallel form, both proposed controllers are able to enhance the transient performance, the system response, and the robustness of the quadcopter controllers. Also, a linear time-invariant SNI UAV dynamic model, in combination with an online adaptive residual nonlinear model using the neural network identification, is proposed to model the natural behavior of a quadcopter system. Through a series of numerical simulations, this paper highlights the effectiveness of our hybrid controller in the face of some parameter variations, such as nonlinear aerodynamic models and exogenous disturbances (e.g., wind gusts). Moreover, it compares its tracking performance with that of a fixed-gain SNI controller and the adaptive Neural-Fuzzy controller separately. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop control system is also discussed using the SNI theorem.

                  The Deep Q-Network (DQN) is one of the key methods in the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which has a deep neural network structure used to estimate 
                        Q
                     -values in Q-learning methods. We have previously implemented a simulation system considering DQN for control of actuator nodes in Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs). In addition, we have designed and implemented a DQN based Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) testbed. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Tabu List Strategy based DQN (TLS-DQN) for AAV mobility control. For evaluation, we compared the simulation results of the mobility control of AAV in indoor single-path environment using normal DQN and the TLS-DQN. The simulation results show that the TLS-DQN has a better performance than the normal DQN.

                  This paper provides a systematic state of the art review on tracking the fine scale movements of fish with the use of autonomous maritime robotics. Knowledge of migration patterns and the localization of specific species of fish at a given time is vital to many aspects of conservation. This paper reviews these technologies and provides insight into what systems are being used and why. The review results show that a larger amount of complex systems that use a deep learning techniques are used over more simplistic approaches to the design. Most results found in the study involve Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, which generally require the most complex array of sensors. The results also provide insight into future research such as methods involving swarm intelligence, which has seen an increase in use in recent years. This synthesis of current and future research will be helpful to research teams working to create an autonomous vehicle with intentions to track, navigate or survey.

                  Real-time driving risk status prediction is critical for developing proactive traffic intervention strategies and enhance driving safety. However, the optimal observation time window length and prediction time window length, which should be the prerequisite for the timeliness and accuracy of real-time driving risk status prediction model, have been rarely explored in previous studies. In this study, a methodology which integrates driving risk status identification, rolling time window-based feature extraction, real-time driving risk status prediction and driving risk influencing factors analysis was proposed to accurately evaluate and predict real-time driving risk status. The methodology was tested based on 1,440 car-following events from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Results show that four driving risk statuses (safe, low-risk, median-risk and high-risk) are most appropriate to establish risk labelling criteria. In addition, results from driving risk status prediction show that when the observation time window length is 0.5 s, the accuracy rate of predicting medium-risk or high-risk status occurring in the next 0.7 s is higher than 85 % using multi-layer perceptron model. Meanwhile, the results from the analysis of influencing factors show that the input variables related to the risk status score higher in the ranking of feature importance. A part from that, speed difference, headway distance, speed and acceleration are still important in predicting driving risk status. The proposed methods in this paper can be applied in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to reduce driver cognitive workload and hence improve driving safety fed with naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle systems.

                  Distance estimation and pedestrian detection are critical for safe driving operation decision-making and autonomous vehicle intelligent control strategies. This paper proposes a novel multi-task Faster R-CNN detector which simultaneously realizes distance estimation and pedestrian detection using an improved ResNet-50 architecture. Images were acquired using a near-infrared camera with two near-infrared fill-lights devices during real road nighttime scenarios. Ground truth pedestrian distances used for training were obtained using LIDAR. The data used to optimize the multi-task Faster R-CNN detector were approximately 20 k high-quality near-infrared images with marked pedestrians and tagged distance values. The proposed algorithm including the distance estimation runs at a speed exceeding 7 fps. Pedestrian detection accuracy reached nearly 80% with a total average absolute distance estimation error rate of less than 5%.

                  Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are an innovative form of traditional vehicles. Automotive Ethernet replaces the controller area network and FlexRay to support the large throughput required by high-definition applications. As CAVs have numerous functions, they exhibit a large attack surface and an increased vulnerability to attacks. However, no previous studies have focused on intrusion detection in automotive Ethernet-based networks. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection method for detecting audio-video transport protocol (AVTP) stream injection attacks in automotive Ethernet-based networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such method developed for automotive Ethernet. The proposed intrusion detection model is based on feature generation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). To evaluate our intrusion detection system, we built a physical BroadR-Reach-based testbed and captured real AVTP packets. The experimental results show that the model exhibits outstanding performance: the F1-score and recall are greater than 0.9704 and 0.9949, respectively. In terms of the inference time per input and the generation intervals of AVTP traffic, our CNN model can readily be employed for real-time detection.

                  This paper proposes a simple and a robust bistable docking system with a deep learning based real-time drogue detection and tracking system for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for mid-air autonomous aerial docking. Secure aerial docking mechanisms between the leader and follower aerial vehicles with effective drogue detection and tracking strategies are fundamental challenges during the air-to-air docking phase of autonomous aerial docking. To confront those issues, this paper not only presents the design of a bistable-based aerial docking mechanism, but also proposes effective deep learning based real-time drogue detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and real-time tracking algorithm using a point cloud algorithm. To ensure novelty and robustness for the aerial docking mechanism, a foldable bistable gripper-type mechanism is designed to increase the grasping performance with simplicity and adaptability. The proposed gripper acts as a drogue by itself to grasp a probe which is attached to the follower aerial vehicle. To employ an effective drogue detection method, the deep learning based real-time object detection algorithm, YOLOv3, is used to implement the drogue detection system. The proposed new probe-and-drogue type bistable docking system has the advantages of being simple and robust. The deep learning based real-time drogue detection method increases the detection rate. Moreover, the real-time tracking algorithm with a depth camera system does not require a GPS/INS system and many other sensors to follow the drogue movement in the air.

                  The prediction of ocean currents is essential for the path planning and control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Regional physics-based forecast models provide valid predictions but are too computationally expensive for real-time prediction necessary for AUV navigation. While vehicle sensors can measure the spatial evolution of currents, temporal prediction remains an open problem as existing data-driven models with real-time capabilities have only been shown to work at locations where data have been used to develop the model. We propose in this paper two predictive tools using deep learning techniques, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network and a Transformer, to perform real-time in-situ prediction of ocean currents at any location. A data set from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is split in two distinct sets to train and test the models. We show that the LSTM and the Transformer have an averaged Normalized Root Mean Squared Error respectively of 0.10 and 0.11 over all test sites with a standard deviation respectively of 0.024 and 0.031. Comparisons with Harmonic Method predictions at various locations in the territorial sea of the United States show that both models provide state-of-the-art accuracy without having been trained with data from these sites.

                  Over recent decades, we have witnessed a widescale deterioration in seagrass habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Although the causes underlying this regression are not yet clear, there is a broad consensus that new methods are required to generate high-quality data on seagrass meadows. Specifically, there is a lack of available data in order to assess changes over time in the spatial distribution of seagrass. This article introduces a new methodology to ease data-gathering operations in Posidonia oceanica meadows for benthic mapping, by using the latest developments in lightweight autonomous vehicles and image processing. The proposed methodology has been designed to build a series of online maps, by employing an input data feed based on an encoder–decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically segments the images recorded by the vehicle. In turn, it uses a sparse Gaussian Process (GP) to map uncertainty linked to the spatial distribution of seagrass. This article presents the most suitable CNN and GP, as well as performance validation results for the method, based on data acquired in three field tests.

                  In this work, we have successfully developed a data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) inverse problem solution for traffic collision reconstruction. In specific, we have developed and implemented a machine learning computational algorithm and built a deep neural network to determine and identify the initial impact conditions of car crash based on its final material damage state and permanently deformed structure configuration (wreckage).
                  In this work, we have demonstrated that the developed machine learning algorithm as an inverse problem solver can accurately identify initial collision conditions in an inverse manner, which are practically unique if we use permanent plastic deformation as the forensic data signatures. In other words, we think that the massive plastic energy dissipation process and the related big data will make final structure damage state insensitive to the initial car collision conditions. Thus, it provides an inverse solution for car crash forensic analysis by reconstructing the initial failure load parameters and conditions based on the permanent plastic deformation distribution of cars. This approach has general significance in solving the inverse problem for engineering failure analysis and vehicle crashworthiness analysis, which provides a key contribution for the unmanned autonomous vehicle and the related technology.

                  Agriculture 3.0 and 4.0 have gradually introduced service robotics and automation into several agricultural processes, mostly improving crops quality and seasonal yield. Row-based crops are the perfect settings to test and deploy smart machines capable of monitoring and manage the harvest. In this context, global path generation is essential either for ground or aerial vehicles, and it is the starting point for every type of mission plan. Nevertheless, little attention has been currently given to this problem by the research community and global path generation automation is still far to be solved. In order to generate a viable path for an autonomous machine, the presented research proposes a feature learning fully convolutional model capable of estimating waypoints given an occupancy grid map. In particular, we apply the proposed data-driven methodology to the specific case of row-based crops with the general objective to generate a global path able to cover the extension of the crop completely. Extensive experimentation with a custom made synthetic dataset and real satellite-derived images of different scenarios have proved the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of an end-to-end and completely autonomous global path planner.

                  This paper addresses the tracking control of an autonomous tractor-trailer robot with a desired distance and orientation angle relative to a combine harvester in the presence of model uncertainties for the autonomous unloading of the harvested cereals in agriculture applications. A coordinate transformation and the prescribed performance technique are employed to develop a second-order Euler-Lagrange formulation of the tracking errors. Then, a neural adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tracking controller is proposed to guarantee that the tracking errors exponentially converge to an arbitrary small ultimate bound with a pre-specified maximum overshoot and convergence rate. By an effective application of the prescribed performance technique, the controller non-singularity, the collision avoidance and connectivity between two vehicles are preserved continuously. The model uncertainties including unknown vehicle parameters, variable trailer mass and moment of inertia during the crop collection, surface friction, climate and crop conditions and external disturbances are compensated by an effective combination of a multi-layer neural network and an adaptive robust control law. Lyapunov's direct method is employed to prove that the tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and converge to a neighborhood of the origin with a prescribed performance. Finally, the computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

                  Future ocean exploration will be dominated by a large-scale deployment of marine robots such as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Without the involvement of human operators, USVs exploit oceans, especially the complex marine environments, in an unprecedented way with an increased mission efficiency. However, current autonomy level of USVs is still limited, and the majority of vessels are being remotely controlled. To address such an issue, artificial intelligence (AI) such as reinforcement learning can effectively equip USVs with high-level intelligence and consequently achieve full autonomous operation. Also, by adopting the concept of multi-agent intelligence, future trend of USV operations is to use them as a formation fleet. Current researches in USV formation control are largely based upon classical control theories such as PID, backstepping and model predictive control methods with the impact by using advanced AI technologies unclear. This paper, therefore, paves the way in this area by proposing a distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm for USV formations. More importantly, using the proposed algorithm USV formations can learn two critical abilities, i.e. adaptability and extendibility that enable formations to arbitrarily increase the number of USVs or change formation shapes. The effectiveness of algorithms has been verified and validated through a number of computer-based simulations.

                  This paper studies the three-dimensional platoon control of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subjected to environmental disturbances and model uncertainties. The main control objective is to design a tracking controller to force a platoon of AUVs to construct a convoy-like formation along feasible trajectories while each consecutive pair preserves a desired line-of-sight distance with limited communication range and every possible collision is avoided between consecutive vehicles. To achieve this objective, the prescribed performance function (PPF) methodology is employed to constrain the relative distance and angles between successive pairs during their motion. A robust neural network (NN), hyperbolic tangent function, and dynamic surface control technique are simultaneously utilized to propose the prescribed performance-based controller which is robust against completely unknown parameters, nonlinear hydrodynamic damping, actuators saturation nonlinearity, NN approximation errors and time-varying environmental disturbances. Lyapunov's direct method is used to prove that all signals of the closed-loop control system are bounded and the relative distance and angles converge to a neighbourhood of the origin. Finally, numerical computer simulations verify the proposed controller performance for offshore applications.

Secondly, the detected coordinate is fused into spatial localization with an extended Kalman filter estimator. Thirdly, a point regression network PointRefine-Net is developed for promoting detection accuracy once the flying vehicle’s motion continuity is checked unacceptable. The proposed approach definitely accomplishes the closed-loop mutual inspection of spatial positioning and image detection, and automatically improves the inaccurate coordinates within a certain range. Experimental results demonstrate and verify that our method outperforms the previous works in terms of accuracy, robustness and real-time criterions.

                  Object detection performed by Autonomous Vehicles (AV)s is a crucial operation that comes ahead of various autonomous driving tasks, such as object tracking, trajectories estimation, and collision avoidance. Dynamic road elements (pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles) impose a greater challenge due to their continuously changing location and behaviour. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art object detection technologies focusing on both the sensory systems and algorithms used. It begins with a brief introduction on the autonomous driving operations and challenges. Then, different sensory systems employed on existing AVs are elaborated while illustrating their advantages, limitations and applications. Also, sensory systems employed by different research are reviewed. Moreover, due to the significant role Deep Neural Networks (DNN)s are playing in object detection tasks, different DNN-based networks are also highlighted. Afterwards, previous research on dynamic objects detection performed by AVs are reviewed in tabular forms. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the outcomes of the review and suggests future work towards the development of vehicles with higher automation levels.

                  This paper serves as an introduction and overview of the potentially useful models and methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of transportation engineering for autonomous vehicle (AV) control in the era of mixed autonomy when AVs drive alongside human-driven vehicles (HV). It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.

                  As a dynamic and essential component in the road environment of urban scenarios, vehicles are the most popular investigation targets. To monitor their behavior and extract their geometric characteristics, an accurate and instant measurement of vehicles plays a vital role in traffic and transportation fields. Point clouds acquired from the mobile laser scanning (MLS) system deliver 3D information of road scenes with unprecedented detail. They have proven to be an adequate data source in the fields of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving, especially for extracting vehicles. However, acquired 3D point clouds of vehicles from MLS systems are inevitably incomplete due to object occlusion or self-occlusion. To tackle this problem, we proposed a neural network to synthesize complete, dense, and uniform point clouds for vehicles from MLS data, named Vehicle Points Completion-Net (VPC-Net). In this network, we introduce a new encoder module to extract global features from the input instance, consisting of a spatial transformer network and point feature enhancement layer. Moreover, a new refiner module is also presented to preserve the vehicle details from inputs and refine the complete outputs with fine-grained information. Given sparse and partial point clouds as inputs, the network can generate complete and realistic vehicle structures and keep the fine-grained details from the partial inputs. We evaluated the proposed VPC-Net in different experiments using synthetic and real-scan datasets and applied the results to 3D vehicle monitoring tasks. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed VPC-Net and show state-of-the-art results.

However, position errors grow exponentially over time due to noises in the sensor measurements. The lack of a public and robust benchmark dataset has however hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of recent machine learning techniques such as deep learning techniques to learn the error in the INS for a more accurate positioning of the vehicle. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset). The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found in the car, as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an Android smart phone sampling at 10 Hz. A diverse number of driving scenarios were captured such as traffic congestion, round-abouts, hard-braking, etc. on different road types (e.g. country roads, motorways, etc.) and with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 h over 1,300 km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 h over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and dependable positioning estimation based on vehicle ego-motion sensors, as well as other related studies.",autonomous vehicle

                  A group of individual truckers can be regarded as a swarm intelligence system without central management. With the development of autonomous driving technology, trucker groups will be replaced by driverless vehicles. At that point, a swarm of truckers will become a swarm robotics system. Therefore, considering the design and control of an efficient swarm robotics system, it is essential to investigate the properties and model the behaviors of a swarm of truckers in advance. In this study, we probe the characteristics of both individual truckers and a swarm of truckers using trajectory data of truckers. First, the trajectory data were map matched based on the geographic scale of cities and administrative regions. Then, the properties of the division of labor, pattern formation, and swarm synchronization were obtained through an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of radius of gyration, travel distance, and the number of visited places. Because predicting the next visit locations of individuals of a swarm is a measure for modeling swarm behaviors, the prediction model can be used to predict future swarm robotics (driverless trucks) behaviors. Thus, we apply several machine learning models to predict the next locations of truckers. The results show that there are common characteristics and routines embodied in the behavior of the truckers; the swarm shows consistency and regularity. Moreover, the peak predictability of the entire group reached 94%, indicating that our model can predict the behavior of groups and individuals. Our findings provide basis supporting to the future efficient swarm robotics system.

                  As technology has evolved, cities have become increasingly smart. Smart mobility is a crucial element in smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are an essential part of smart mobility. However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.

Through end-to-end learning powered by neural networks, the proposed approach can achieve the perception of the environment and continuous motion output control. This proposed approach includes: (1) A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based control framework to provide learning and autonomous decision-making capability for UAVs; (2) An improved method named MN-DDPG for introducing a type of mixed noises to assist UAV with exploring stochastic strategies for online optimal planning; and (3) An algorithm of task-decomposition and pre-training for efficient transfer learning to improve the generalization capability of UAV’s control model built based on MN-DDPG.

                  Autonomous vehicles are becoming central for the future of mobility, supported by advances in deep learning techniques. The performance of aself-driving system is highly dependent on the quality of the perception task. Developments in sensor technologies have led to an increased availability of 3D scanners such as LiDAR, allowing for a more accurate representation of the vehicle's surroundings, leading to safer systems. The rapid development and consequent rise of research studies around self-driving systems since early 2010, resulted in a tremendous increase in the number and novelty of object detection methods. After the first wave of works that essentially tried to expand known techniques from object detection in images, more recently there has been a notable development in newer and more adapted to LiDAR data works. This paper addresses the existing literature on object detection using LiDAR data within the scope of self-driving and brings a systematic way for analysing it. Unlike general object detection surveys, we will focus on point-cloud data, which presents specific challenges, notably its high-dimensional and sparse nature. This work introduces a common object detection pipeline and taxonomy to facilitate a thorough comparison between different techniques and, departing from it, this work will critically examine the representation of data (critical for complexity reduction), feature extraction and finally the object detection models. A comparison between performance results of the different models is included, alongside with some future research challenges.

                  The Multiuser Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) has been proposed for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) communication systems in a long transmission distance to transmit multiple users over the same channel bandwidth. Unfortunately, the DSSS data rate is limited by four users as a maximum due to the extensive multipath arrivals. This paper proposes a new scheme for the AUV communication systems called, deep learning coded index modulation-spread spectrum (DL-CIM-SS), to overcome the increasing data rate restriction of limited users number. The proposed DL-CIM-SS transmits the majority of information bits via the index of spreading code instead of transmitting all information bits physical. That doesn't only harvest more energy efficiency as the majority of information bits are not transmitted physically anymore, but also provide almost perfect detection at the receiver end. To further save the AUV energy, a pre-processing stage is added before feeding the received signal into the DL-based detector; the DL-based detector becomes environment-independent and no more training will be required during the online deployment. The proposed DL-CIM-SS performance is evaluated in this paper over simulation and measured underwater acoustic channels. The simulation results show the ability of the proposed scheme to increase the underwater acoustic data rate with significant energy efficiency improvement and low system bit and symbol error rate.

                  Detecting hot regions plays an important role in urban traffic planning and analytics, which is also useful in self-driving car routing and navigation. In this light, we propose and study a novel urban hot-region detection method by using massive geo-tagged image data. Given a set Q of regions (each region q is made up by a set of geo-tagged images), and a matching threshold 
                        
                           θ
                        
                     , if a region q is matched with m other regions, its hot degree is defined by m. The hot-region detection (HRD) search finds the regions with the highest hot degrees. We believe that this type of search may benefit many applications in self-driving cars, including route planning and navigation, and traffic management and analytics in general. The HRD search is challenging due to two reasons. First, how to evaluate the similarity when matching different regions. Second, how to compute the HRD search efficiently, since its time complexity is 
                        
                           O
                           (
                           |
                           Q
                           
                              
                                 |
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           )
                        
                     . To overcome the challenges, we define a novel spatial-density correlation measure to evaluate the similarity between two regions, and develop a parallel search framework to process the HRD efficiently. In addition, a series of optimization techniques, e.g., pruning techniques, are defined to further enhance the query efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real data sets to study the performance of the developed methods.

                  Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision systems with a wide range of applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, retail, security, face recognition, robotics, and others. Nowadays, neural networks-based models are used to localize and classify instances of objects of particular classes. When real-time inference is not required, ensembles of models help to achieve better results.
                  In this work, we present a novel method for fusing predictions from different object detection models: weighted boxes fusion. Our algorithm utilizes confidence scores of all proposed bounding boxes to construct averaged boxes.
                  We tested the method on several datasets and evaluated it in the context of Open Images and COCO Object Detection challenges, achieving top results in these challenges. The 3D version of boxes fusion was successfully applied by the winning teams of Waymo Open Dataset and Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles challenges.

                  This study focuses on lightweight optimum design of head pressure shell of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with reliability requirements. The grid sandwich structure is applied to the pressure shell for lightweight. An optimal mathematical model is established, which takes weight and the maximum von-Mises stress as objective and strength requirement as a constraint condition. This optimization model is solved by genetic algorithm (GA) based on back propagation (BP) neural network surrogate model, which is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for improving accuracy. Additionally, the randomness of geometry sizes, material properties and loads are considered to ensure reliability. A stress-strength interference model is established for obtaining failure probability and reliability according to statistical regularity of yield strength and the maximum von-Mises stress. The result shows that the weight of grid sandwich structure pressure shell is reduced by 38.26% compared with the solid pressure shell. The width of transverse grid has more influence on the maximum von-Mises stress than longitudinal grid. The critical load factor is 21.611 and buckling deformation will not occur under given conditions. The pressure shell with grid sandwich structure meets three sigma level with random variables, which can ensure enough reliability of AUV. The above analysis shows that application of grid sandwich structure to the pressure shell of AUV head is feasible.

                  Predicting pedestrian trajectory is useful in many applications, such as autonomous driving and unmanned vehicles. However, it is a challenging task because of the complexity of the interactions among pedestrians and the environment. Most existing works employ long short-term memory networks to learn pedestrian behaviors, but their prediction accuracy is not good, and their computing speed is relatively slow. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-information-based convolutional neural network (MI-CNN) to incorporate the historical trajectory, depth map, pose, and 2D-3D size information to predict the future trajectory of the pedestrian subject. After training, we evaluate our model on crowded videos in the public datasets MOT16 and MOT20. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both in prediction accuracy and computing speed.

In this research, we investigated recent cyberattacks that utilize AI-based techniques and identified various mitigation strategies that are helpful in handling such attacks. Further, we identified existing methods and techniques that are used in executing AI-based cyberattacks and what probable future scenarios will be plausible to control such attacks by identifying existing trends in AI-based cyberattacks.

                  3D motion estimation is an important prerequisite for the autonomous operation of vehicles and robots in dynamic environments. This work presents FeatFlow, a novel neural network architecture to estimate 3D motions from unstructured point clouds. Specifically, we learn deep geometric features to estimate the dense scene flow and the ego-motion of the platform. We build a scene flow estimation pipeline by an encoder-decoder architecture which comprises three novel modules: feature extractor, motion embedder, and flow decoder. By using a point-score layer to assign scores to the extracted features in a learning procedure, the feature extractor effectively extracts keypoints and features that are most significant for estimating the relative transformation between two consecutive point clouds. The whole model adaptively learns the required robust descriptors to represent a variety of point motions at the object or scene level. We evaluated our approach on synthetic data from FlyingThings3D, and real-world LiDAR scans from KITTI and Oxford RobotCar. Our network successfully generalizes to datasets with different patterns, outperforming various baselines and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

                  In recent times, Autonomous Moving Platforms (AMP) have been a vital component for various industrial sectors across the globe as they include a diverse set of aerial, marine, and land-based vehicles. The emergence and the rise of AMP necessitate a precise object-level understanding of the environment, which directly impacts the functioning like decision making, speed control, and direction of the autonomous driving vehicles. Obstacle detection and object classification are the key issues in the AMP. The autonomous vehicle is designed to move in the city roads and it should be bolstered with high-quality object detection/segmentation mechanisms since inaccurate movements and speed limits can prove to be fatal.

Further, K-Means clustering based Speed Range Analyser (SRA) is proposed to determine the acceptable and safe speed range for the vehicle, which is computed based on the object density of every object in the environment. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms compared to traditional schemes in terms of latency and accuracy.

                  Weather forecasting plays a fundamental role in the early warning of weather impacts on various aspects of human livelihood. For instance, weather forecasting provides decision making support for autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic accidents and congestions, which completely depend on the sensing and predicting of external environmental factors such as rainfall, air visibility and so on. Accurate and timely weather prediction has always been the goal of meteorological scientists. However, the conventional theory-driven numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods face many challenges, such as incomplete understanding of physical mechanisms, difficulties in obtaining useful knowledge from the deluge of observation data, and the requirement of powerful computing resources. With the successful application of data-driven deep learning method in various fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series prediction, it has been proven that deep learning method can effectively mine the temporal and spatial features from the spatio-temporal data. Meteorological data is a typical big geospatial data. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) is expected to be a strong supplement to the conventional method. At present, many researchers have tried to introduce data-driven deep learning into weather forecasting, and have achieved some preliminary results. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of deep learning-based weather forecasting, in the aspects of the design of neural network (NN) architectures, spatial and temporal scales, as well as the datasets and benchmarks. Then we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of DLWP by comparing it with the conventional NWP, and summarize the potential future research topics of DLWP.

                  Accurate and timely weather prediction is of significance for autonomous vehicles, such as designing more appropriate sensors or other configurations and developing safer driving strategies. Generally, as the mainstream weather prediction method, numerical weather prediction (NWP) relies on high-quality spatio-temporal observations. However, the precise state of the real world is not measurable. Thus, how to obtain a proper initial condition estimation based on big geospatial-temporal data is a crucial procedure for NWP. Data assimilation (DA) has been a traditional solution to the problem, for the better performance of which various mathematical-physics models have been used. However, the computational effectiveness and efficiency are still largely compromised by the complicated and nonparallel integration process in existing DA methods. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method named HDA-MLP to address the DA problem. We first constructed a customized MLP by introducing the temporal peculiarities of the state variables to simulate and optimize pure 3DVar and EnKF. Then we blended the optimized analysis fields directly by implicitly updating the background error covariance matrix through another neural network model to alleviate the dependence on traditional DA methods. We conducted extensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal by utilizing two classical nonlinear dynamic models. Results reveal that our approach has better robustness and enhanced capability to capture the variation of state variables. Notably, the analysis quality and computational efficiency are significantly improved.

                  Images of road scenes in low-light situations are lack of details which could increase crash risk of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Therefore, an effective and efficient image enhancement model for low-light images is necessary for safe CAV driving. Though some efforts have been made, image enhancement still cannot be well addressed especially in extremely low light situations (e.g., in rural areas at night without street light). To address this problem, we developed a light enhancement net (LE-net) based on the convolutional neural network. Firstly, we proposed a generation pipeline to transform daytime images to low-light images, and then used them to construct image pairs for model development. Our proposed LE-net was then trained and validated on the generated low-light images. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of our LE-net in real night situations at various low-light levels. Results showed that our LE-net was superior to the compared models, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Deep learning has been widely used to extract useful information from network big data for enhancing network quality-of-service and user quality-of-experience. Privacy preservation for user and network data is a burning concern in 5G heterogeneous networks due to various attacks in this environment. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation on how deep learning can cope with privacy preservation issues in 5G heterogeneous networks, in terms of heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs), beyond-RAN networks, and end-to-end network slices, followed by a set of key research challenges and open issues that aim to guide future research.

Technology based companies such as Google and Audi are getting closer to realizing the dream of seeing fully AVs on the road. A vehicle’s severely nonlinear dynamics due to the forces acting between road and vehicle tires, the coupling characteristic, and the uncertainties of parameters such as wheel moment of inertia and vehicle mass have made it rather difficult to approximate a precise mathematical model of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, to overcome these challenges we propose a model-independent control method based on improved adaptive neural controllers for path tracking control of AVs. In the structure of these improved neural controllers, we employ interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) as activation functions. Despite the interdependence of a vehicle’s longitudinal and lateral motions, many of the research works on the path tracking of AVs have only focused on lateral motion control. By using the inputs of steering angle and torque, the presented control scheme tackles the simultaneous control of lateral and longitudinal moves. Results obtained from the lateral controller based on an improved neural network (NN) have been analyzed first at a constant velocity of 20 m/s and with/without considering parametric uncertainties. Then the longitudinal controller based on the improved NN is compared with sliding mode and common NN based controllers. Finally, the results obtained by simulating the simultaneous control of lateral and longitudinal motions indicate maximum tracking errors of 0.04 m (for lateral path following) and 0.02 m/s (for longitudinal velocity) and demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed control approach.",autonomous vehicle

                  This paper investigates the adaptive prescribed performance trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated underwater vehicles subjected to unmodeled hydrodynamics, ocean disturbances and input quantization. The controller is synchronized through the command filter-based backstepping design and minimum learning parameter algorithm, thus the adverse effect of “explosion of complexity” and computational complexity inherent in neural network is avoided. To endow tracking errors with prescribed performance guarantees, a mapping function is applied such that the constrained control problem could be transformed to the unconstrained one. By resorting to the hysteresis quantizer, the frequency of data transmission is considerably reduced and the quantization errors are effectively reduced under the proposed control scheme. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is verified that the proposed method is capable of ensuring asymptotic stability for tracking errors. Numerical simulation results reveal the advantage and effectiveness of this work.

                  Inferring the depth of images is a fundamental inverse problem within the field of Computer Vision since depth information is obtained through 2D images, which can be generated from infinite possibilities of observed real scenes. Benefiting from the progress of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explore structural features and spatial image information, Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) is often highlighted in scopes of scientific and technological innovation, as this concept provides advantages related to its low implementation cost and robustness to environmental conditions. In the context of autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art CNNs optimize the SIDE task by producing high-quality depth maps, which are essential during the autonomous navigation process in different locations. However, such networks are usually supervised by sparse and noisy depth data, from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) laser scans, and are carried out at high computational cost, requiring high-performance Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we propose a new lightweight and fast supervised CNN architecture combined with novel feature extraction models which are designed for real-world autonomous navigation. We also introduce an efficient surface normals module, jointly with a simple geometric 2.5D loss function, to solve SIDE problems. We also innovate by incorporating multiple Deep Learning techniques, such as the use of densification algorithms and additional semantic, surface normals and depth information to train our framework. The method introduced in this work focuses on robotic applications in indoor and outdoor environments and its results are evaluated on the competitive and publicly available NYU Depth V2 and KITTI Depth datasets.

                  The human impact on the coastal ecosystems is a global environmental concern. Due to the growing urbanization, industrialization, and transportation, this impact on the living and non-living components of the coastal area is expected to further increase in the coming years. Artificial intelligence based automation of the coastal monitoring, including data collection, analysis and decision making, provides real-time insights and opportunities for large-scale coastal management and governance. In this paper, a framework for autonomous litter surveying and human activity monitoring for governance intelligence in coastal eco-cyber-physical systems (ecoCystem) is presented. A large dataset of more than 20,000 images focused on smart coastal management is collected to model the real world scenarios. A combination of various artificial intelligence based methods are used for automatic detection and classification of various litter in the coastal environment. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of autonomous monitoring of humans activities and detection of illegal entry of vehicles and boats to the beach area. The accuracy of the proposed autonomous system is 87% for correct classification of fully visible litter and 95% for fully visible vehicles. The experimental results show that the application of computer vision and machine learning for autonomous litter classification shows promising results for increasing the speed and scale of litter surveying in the coastal area. Further training of the artificial intelligence models is necessary for increasing the accuracy of the proposed framework and real-world deployment in the coastal environment. The proposed human activity monitoring system can be used for autonomous coastal law enforcement and real-time and active protection of the coastal zones.

                  As supply chains recover from the impact of COVID-19, a sudden acceleration of interest in digitalization and automation is expected, as firms increasingly look towards digital technologies as sources of innovation in the wake of an extreme disruption. The purpose of this study is to utilize the experience of supply chain practitioners, to ascertain the current level of adoption of a number of key Industry 4.0 technologies, understand what preparatory measures are being taken by firms to ensure they are digitally-ready to utilise Industry 4.0 technologies, recognise how and where these technologies are likely impact supply chains, and investigate whether organisational size is a factor in technology adoption. This empirical study utilises primary data from a descriptive survey of supply chain practitioners working across a range of industry sectors and different stages in the supply chain. Whilst the findings from this research indicate that some Industry 4.0 technologies are still in the early stages of adoption, amongst Australian supply chain organisations, they clearly show which technologies are anticipated to have the greatest impact, what sectors that impact will most likely occur in, and which specific improvements they are expected to drive. Larger firms were found to be more digitally-ready than smaller firms, and a number of significant gaps were identified between expected impact and expected investment, meaning little spend is currently projected for certain technologies that are expected to have a significant impact.

                  This paper describes a framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. Disruptive technologies include high-tech and emerging technologies such as AI, industry 4.0, IoT, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), big data, virtual reality (VR), Drone technology, and Autonomous Robots, 5 G, and blockchain to offer digital transformation, research and development and service delivery. Disruptive technologies are essential for Industry 4.0 development, which can be applied to many disciplines. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. The proposed framework restricts the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks, ensures the safety of the healthcare teams and maintains patients' physical and psychological healthcare conditions. The framework is designed to deal with the severe shortage of PPE for the medical team, reduce the massive pressure on hospitals, and track recovered patients to treat COVID-19 patients with plasma. The study provides oversight for governments on how to adopt technologies to reduce the impact of unprecedented outbreaks for COVID-19. Our work illustrates an empirical case study on the analysis of real COVID-19 patients and shows the importance of the proposed intelligent framework to limit the current outbreaks for COVID-19. The aim is to help the healthcare team make rapid decisions to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals, home quarantine, or identifying and treating patients with typical cold or flu.

Using satellite AIS data and the algorithms of the publicly available Global Fishing Watch database, a spatial map of trawling in a 0.01-degree latitude by 0.01-degree longitude square grid was created to review the data available to map this footprint. From 2012 to 2018 much of the trawling effort for all countries focused on Koko, Yuryaku, Kammu, and Colahan Seamounts at depths between 400 m (summits) and the depth limit currently set by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission of 1500 m. Additional seamounts with fishing activity included Annei (North Koko), Kinmei, Jingu, and Suiko. The remaining ES-NHR seamount locations show no trawling in those years. Bottom contact fishing was predominately carried out by ships with flag states of Japan and Korea. To date there appears to be compliance with the recent small-scale closures on C–H seamount and Koko. An additional source of data comes from scientific Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) surveys in 2014 and 2015 from three of these seamounts, in which scars from bottom contact gear are readily visible. These cover a smaller spatial area and depth range than the satellite data, but indicate the full footprint is not encompassed by the satellite data, suggesting either the fishing footprint is not fully captured by the AIS approach or that the footprint has shifted through time. AUV surveys also provide data on areas where abundant megafauna occur, which can provide candidate starting points for VME management efforts and further closures, similar to ones already in effect in the ES-NHR. The combination of satellite and AUV data provide a finer-scale fisheries footprint for this region that can aid in management of these sites.",autonomous vehicle

The recently emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have shown promise for addressing the UAV navigation problem, but most of these methods cannot converge due to the massive amounts of interactive data when a UAV is navigating in high dynamic environments, where there are numerous obstacles moving fast. In this work, we propose an improved DRL-based method to tackle these fundamental limitations. To be specific, we develop a distributed DRL framework to decompose the UAV navigation task into two simpler sub-tasks, each of which is solved through the designed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based DRL network by using only part of the interactive data. Furthermore, a clipped DRL loss function is proposed to closely stack the two sub-solutions into one integral for the UAV navigation problem. Extensive simulation results are provided to corroborate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the convergence and effectiveness compared with those of the state-of-the-art DRL methods.",autonomous vehicle

                  The pervasive capabilities and myriad of mission performance abilities of Unmanned (Combat) Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/UCAVs) have exponentially grown their deployment possibilities in the recent past. Advancements in artificial intelligence, sensing technologies and autonomous guidance, navigation and control capabilities have further fueled wide-scale deployments of UAVs, both for military and commercial applications, ranging from autonomous air taxis and cargo deliveries to intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat missions. Most of these applications consume Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based location information for their services, which is also shared in real-time with ground control stations and centralized service operators, often using insecure communication channels. This limitation has significantly raised the location privacy concerns of aerial vehicles, deployed to conduct user-centric, safety-critical and localization-sensitive operations. A compromise of location privacy of a UAV can pose serious threats, including stalking, theft or damage of UAV/payload or even use of GNSS-guided munitions. These emerging threats call for robust and trust-worthy solutions for preserving the location privacy of aerial vehicles.
                  This paper proposes a novel obfuscation-based mechanism to safeguard location information against privacy attacks. Our proposed solution conceals actual information by transmitting modified location parameters, either after diluting their accuracy or by fabricating deceptive trajectories for a known eavesdropper. Based on these two broad categories, defined as Attenuation and Deception-based obfuscation techniques respectively, we also present a novel taxonomy of 3D obfuscation mechanisms, supported by formal descriptions of underlying operators. The operators can be used independently or in conjunction to satisfy diverse mission-specific obfuscation profiles. The proposed operators have been practically implemented and evaluated using a customizable obfuscator deployed over a Global Positioning System (GPS) guided UAV. The field experiments validate the efficacy, security and deployability of the proposed solution against location-privacy threats.

                  Routine cleaning of the corroded ship hulls in dry dock maintenance guarantees the smooth operation of the shipping industry. Deploying the autonomous system to remove the corrosion by water-blasting is a feasible approach to ease the burden in manual operation and to reduce water, time, and energy consumption. In this paper, the water-blasting framework is proposed for a novel robot platform named Hornbill with the adhesion mechanism by permanent magnetic, self-localization by sensor fusion to navigate smoothly on a vertical surface. Hence, we propose a complete waypoint path planning (CWPP) to re-blast the self-synthesizing deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based corrosion heatmap by initial-blasting. The optimal CWPP problem, including the shortest travel distance and shortest travel time to save water, power while ensuring visiting all predefined waypoints by benchmarking output, is modeled as the classic Travel Salesman Problem (TSP). Further, the Pareto-optimal trajectory for given TSP has been driven by the reinforcement learning (RL) technique with a proposed reward function based on the robot's operation during blasting. From the experimental results at the shipyard site, the proposed RL-based CWPP generates the Pareto-optimal trajectory that enables the water-blasting robot to spend about 10% of energy and 9% of water less than the second-best evolutionary-based optimization method in various workspaces.

While most self-driving technologies focus on the outside environment, there is also a need to provide in-vehicle intelligence (e.g., detect health and safety issues related with the car occupants). Set within an R&D project focused on in-vehicle cockpit intelligence, the research presented in this paper addresses an unsupervised Acoustic Anomaly Detection (AAD) task. Since data is nonexistent in this domain, we first design an in-vehicle sound event data simulator that can realistically mix background audios (recorded from car driving trips) with normal (e.g., people talking, radio on) and abnormal (e.g., people arguing, cough) event sounds, allowing the generation of three synthetic in-vehicle sound datasets. Then, we explore two main sound feature extraction methods (based on a combination of three audio features and mel frequency energy coefficients) and propose a novel Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (LSTM-AE) deep learning architecture for in-vehicle sound anomaly detection. Competitive results were achieved by the proposed LSTM-AE when compared with two state-of-the-art methods, namely a dense Autoencoder (AE) and a two-stage clustering.",autonomous vehicle

                  Deep learning (DL) models have achieved impressive performance in various domains such as medicine, finance, and autonomous vehicle systems with advances in computing power and technologies. However, due to the black-box structure of DL models, the decisions of these learning models often need to be explained to end-users. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) provides explanations of black-box models to reveal the behavior and underlying decision-making mechanisms of the models through tools, techniques, and algorithms. Visualization techniques help to present model and prediction explanations in a more understandable, explainable, and interpretable way. This survey paper aims to review current trends and challenges of visual analytics in interpreting DL models by adopting XAI methods and present future research directions in this area. We reviewed literature based on two different aspects, model usage and visual approaches. We addressed several research questions based on our findings and then discussed missing points, research gaps, and potential future research directions. This survey provides guidelines to develop a better interpretation of neural networks through XAI methods in the field of visual analytics.

                  With the deployment of 5G, researchers and experts begin to look forward to 6G. They predict that 6G will be the key driving force for information interaction and social life after 2030. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), 6G will be a highly autonomous closed-loop network, and will make up for 5G's shortcomings in communications, computing and global coverage, achieving “AI of things (AIoT)”. In 6G life, vehicles may become another indispensable devices for people besides smartphones, and non-polluting, highly safe as well as full-autonomous vehicles will be the goal of vehicular development. In order to ensure the safe driving of future vehicles and meet the entertainment needs of passengers, it is necessary to investigate future 6G vehicular intelligence. In this paper, we will discuss its networking, communications, computing and intelligence, look into future technological developments and applications, and identify forthcoming challenges and research directions.

                  In the near future, vehicular networks are expected to provide and consume a variety of services for autonomous driving, connected car, and Internet of Things (IoT). For practical service scenarios, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the dynamic environment and Quality of Services (QoS) in a vehicular network. The goal of this paper is to maximize service delivery ratio while meeting QoS factors. We present three issues to be addressed by a road side unit (RSU) acting as a fog server. The first issue is the scheduling of services with different effective time. The second is the RSU cache replacement strategy considering limited storage space. The third is the QoS-based message collision control for channels that multiple vehicles share. This paper solves these three issues by leveraging Deep Q Network (DQN), one of deep reinforcement learning techniques. To this end, the three problems are defined as Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments. Experimental results substantiate that the proposed method based on DQN can find a policy that is adaptive to situations through learning for each defined problem.

                  This paper proposes a design method for the coordination of velocity profiles of autonomous vehicles in non-signalized intersection scenarios. The coordination is motivated by the avoidance of vehicle collision and the minimization of their energy loss resulted by stop and go maneuvers in the intersection. Therefore, the coordinated design is formed as an optimal control problem, which is solved through two optimization tasks. A quadratic optimization task with online solution is formed, which provides guarantees on the avoidance of the collision. Moreover, a reinforcement-learning-based optimization task with offline solution is formed, which is able to improve the economy performances of the autonomous vehicles. The optimization tasks are interconnected, i.e. the quadratic optimization with the vehicle model is used as an environment during the training process. The effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control through simulation examples with three number of autonomous vehicles is illustrated.

                  Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be leveraged to enable cooperative platooning control to alleviate traffic oscillations. However, in the near future, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist on roads, creating a mixed-flow traffic environment. In mixed-flow traffic, CAV platoons would inevitably encounter lane changes by HDVs in adjacent lanes. These lane changes can generate disturbances and oscillations upstream, jeopardizing the performance of platooning control. Hence, it is necessary to explore the interactions between CAVs and HDVs in the lane-change process, to analyze how CAVs can be used to manage disruptive lane changes of HDVs in mixed-flow traffic. This study proposes deep reinforcement learning-based proactive longitudinal control for CAVs to counteract disruptive HDV lane-change behaviors that can induce disturbances, such that the smoothness of traffic flow can be preserved in the platooning control process. Results from numerical experiments suggest that CAVs controlled by the proposed control strategy can effectively reduce the occurrence of disruptive lane-change maneuvers of HDVs to improve string stability performance in mixed-flow traffic. Further, the reliability of the proposed control strategy for different HDV driver types is illustrated.

However, one of the biggest risks and challenges for the UAV-CSS is analysis, process, and transmission data, especially, the limitations of computational capacity, storage and overloading the transmission bandwidth. Regard to conventional methods, almost the data collected from UAVs is processed and transmitted that cost huge energy. A certain amount of data is redundant and not necessary to be processed or transmitted. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to optimize the transmission and reception of data in UAV-CSS systems, based on the platforms of artificial intelligence (AI) for data processing. The algorithm creates an initial background frame and update to the complete background which is sent to server. It splits the region of interest (moving objects) in the scene and then sends only the changes. This supports the CSS to reduce significantly either data storage or data transmission. In addition, the complexity of the systems could be significantly reduced. The main contributions of the algorithm can be listed as follows; - The developed solution can reduce data transmission significantly. - The solution can empower smart manufacturing via camera surveillance. - Simulation results have validated practical viability of this approach. The experimental method results show that reducing up to 80% of storage capacity and transmission data.",autonomous vehicle

                  Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most highly anticipated technological advancements of our time, with potentially wide-ranging social implications in terms of driver/passenger safety, equity and environmental aspects. However, most consumers feel reluctant towards the adoption of AI-powered AVs. To analyse user acceptance of AI-powered AVs, we need to understand the related psychological, social and cognitive factors. To do so, we established a conceptual model based on the technology acceptance literature and considered how performance and effort expectancy, social recognition, hedonism technology security and privacy concerns influence both technology trust and user well-being as mediators that subsequently influence the behavioural intention of the use of AI-powered AVs. We used user innovativeness as a moderator, and we performed a survey in France. Our results from the structural equation modelling largely support the positive relationship between the behavioural intention to use AI-powered AVs and performance-/effort expectancy, social recognition, well-being, hedonism and technology trust, as well as security. On the other hand, privacy concerns negatively influence technology trust.

In a variety of battlefield mission scenarios, UAVs are required to safely fly to designated locations without human intervention. Therefore, finding a suitable method to solve the UAV Autonomous Motion Planning (AMP) problem can improve the success rate of UAV missions to a certain extent. In recent years, many studies have used Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to address the AMP problem and have achieved good results. From the perspective of sampling, this paper designs a sampling method with double-screening, combines it with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, and proposes the Relevant Experience Learning-DDPG (REL-DDPG) algorithm. The REL-DDPG algorithm uses a Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) mechanism to break the correlation of continuous experiences in the experience pool, finds the experiences most similar to the current state to learn according to the theory in human education, and expands the influence of the learning process on action selection at the current state. All experiments are applied in a complex unknown simulation environment constructed based on the parameters of a real UAV. The training experiments show that REL-DDPG improves the convergence speed and the convergence result compared to the state-of-the-art DDPG algorithm, while the testing experiments show the applicability of the algorithm and investigate the performance under different parameter conditions.",autonomous vehicle

These updates are utilized to provide enhanced features and updated security mechanisms. In order to ensure scalability and smooth roll-out Over-the-air (OTA) mechanism is a preferred option to propagate a software update. However, this approach is vulnerable to security attacks because of existence of wireless communication channel between the vehicle and the manufacturer. In that, an attacker can replace the legitimate software with a malicious software with an intent to get control over the vehicle. In this work, we are motivated to address this problem. We develop an enhanced uptane framework for detection of malicious OTA software updates in autonomous vehicles. For enhancing security, we incorporate convolutional neural network (CNN) in the uptane framework. The proposed framework is able to distinguish between malicious and benign software executables with high accuracy. For training and testing, we create two datasets by collecting executables of Windows and Linux operating system. We encourage the use of transfer learning by exploiting the developed CNN models in order to detect malicious executable designed for autonomous vehicles. We also benchmark the CNN models against state-of-the art models. Our work is highly beneficial for the community in providing a secure mechanism for software updates.",autonomous vehicle

Meanwhile, the vulnerability of CNN model to soft errors (e.g., caused by radiation induced) rapidly increases, thus reliability is crucial especially in real-time system. There are many traditional techniques for improve the reliability of the system, e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy, but these techniques incur high overheads, which makes them hard to deploy. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the vulnerable parts of Alexnet mode (e.g., fault injector). Results show that FADD and LD are the top vulnerable instructions against soft errors for Alexnet model, both instructions generate at least 84% of injected faults as SDC errors. Thus, these the only parts of the Alexnet model that need to be hardened instead of using fully duplication solutions.",autonomous vehicle

It creates novel attack surfaces for high impact cyberattacks affecting the society. Addressing the cybersecurity challenges introduced by modern vehicles requires a proactive and multi-faceted approach combining techniques originating from various domains of ICT. Emerging technologies such as 5G, LiDAR, novel in-vehicle and roadside sensors and smart charging, used in modern cars, introduce new challenges and potential security gaps in the next generation mobility ecosystem. Thus, it is critical that the domain’s cybersecurity must be approached in a structured manner from a multi-domain and multi-technology perspective. The CARAMEL H2020 project aims to address the cybersecurity challenges on the pillars upon which the next generation mobility is constructed (i.e., autonomous mobility, connected mobility, electromobility). To achieve that, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques will be utilized for the identification of anomalies and the classification of incoming signals indicating a cyber-attack or a cybersecurity risk. Apart from risk detection, methods for the mitigation of the identified risks will also be continuously incorporated to the CARAMEL solution. The final goal of CARAMEL is to create an anti-hacking platform for the European automotive cybersecurity and to demonstrate its value through extensive attack and penetration scenarios. In this paper we will expand on the unique cybersecurity-relevant characteristics of the pillars upon which the CARAMEL solution is built. Next, a number of use cases emerging from such analysis will be extracted in order to form the basis upon which the CARAMEL platform will be evaluated. Finally, we will conclude with an overview of the platform’s architectural composition.",autonomous vehicle

                  Recent progress in parallel computing machines, deep neural networks, and training techniques have contributed to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to tasks such as object classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The development of such deep learning-based techniques has enabled AI-based networks to outperform humans in the recognition of objects in images. The graphics processing unit (GPU) has been the primary component used for parallel computing during the inference and training phases of deep neural networks. In this study, we perform training using a desktop or a server with one or more GPUs and inference using hardware accelerators on embedded devices. Performance, power consumption, and requirements of embedded system present major hindrances to the application of deep neural network-based systems using embedded controllers such as drones, AI speakers, and autonomous vehicles. In particular, power consumption of a commercial GPU commonly surpasses the power budget of a stand-alone embedded system.
                  To reduce the power consumption of hardware accelerators, reductions in the precision of input data and hardware weight have become popular topics of research in this field. However, precision and accuracy share a trade-off relationship. Therefore, it is essential to optimize precision in a manner that does not degrade the accuracy of the inference process. In this context, the primary issues faced by hardware accelerators are loss of accuracy and high power consumption.

                  Research on unmanned aerial vehicles is growing as they are becoming less expensive and more available than before. The applications span a large number of areas and include border security, search and rescue, wildlife surveying, firefighting, precision agriculture, structure inspection, surveying and mapping, aerial photography, and recreative applications. These applications can require autonomous behavior which is only possible with a precise and robust self-localization. Until recently, the favored approach to localization was based on inertial sensors and global navigation satellite systems. However, global navigation satellite systems have multiple shortcomings related to long-distance radio communications (e.g. non-line-of-sight reception, multipath, spoofing). This motivated the development of new approaches to supplement or supplant satellite navigation. Absolute visual localization is one of the two main approaches to vision-based localization. The goal is to locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map or georeferenced imagery from previous flights. Various approaches were proposed in this area and this paper review most of the literature in this field since 2015. The problematic at hand is analyzed and defined. Existing approaches are reviewed in 4 categories: template matching, feature points matching, deep learning and visual odometry.

                  With recent advances in non-contact sensing technology such as cameras, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has witnessed a prominent growth in deep learning-based condition assessment techniques of structural systems. These deep learning methods rely primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN networks are trained using a large number of datasets for various types of damage and anomaly detection and post-disaster reconnaissance. The trained networks are then utilized to analyze newer data to detect the type and severity of the damage, enhancing the capabilities of non-contact sensors in developing autonomous SHM systems. In recent years, a broad range of CNN architectures has been developed by researchers to accommodate the extent of lighting and weather conditions, the quality of images, the amount of background and foreground noise, and multiclass damage in the structures. This paper presents a detailed literature review of existing CNN-based techniques in the context of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. The review is categorized into multiple classes depending on the specific application and development of CNNs applied to data obtained from a wide range of structures. The challenges and limitations of the existing literature are discussed in detail at the end, followed by a brief conclusion on potential future research directions of CNN in structural condition assessment.

                  Autonomous systems such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), assistive robots are set improve the way we live. Autonomous systems need to be equipped with capabilities to Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with its environment through trial and error, which has gained significant interest from research community for its promise to efficiently learn decision making through abstraction of experiences. However, most of the control algorithms used today in current autonomous systems such as driverless vehicle prototypes or mobile robots are controlled through supervised learning methods or manually designed rule-based policies. Additionally, many emerging autonomous systems such as driverless cars, are set in a multi-agent environment, often with partial observability. Learning decision making policies in multi-agent environments is a challenging problem, because the environment is not stationary from the perspective of a learning agent, and hence the Markov properties assumed in single agent RL does not hold. This paper focuses on learning decision-making policies in multi-agent environments, both in cooperative settings with full observability and dynamic environments with partial observability. We present experiments in simple, yet effective, new multi-agent environments to simulate policy learning in scenarios that could be encountered by an autonomous navigating agent such as a CAV. The results illustrate how agents learn to cooperate in order to achieve their objectives successfully. Also, it was shown that in a partially observable setting, an agent was capable of learning to roam around its environment without colliding in the presence of obstacles and other moving agents. Finally, the paper discusses how data-driven multi-agent policy learning can be extended to real-world environments by augmenting the intelligence of autonomous vehicles.

                  Because operational environments change over time and technology upgrades are common in fleets of ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles quickly become obsolete. A possible solution is to develop fleets of modular vehicles, which are built with interchangeable components, i.e. modules. This paper evaluates the performance of a future reconfigurable and autonomous vehicle fleet in a high fidelity military operation scenario. The military fleet operates in a hostile environment under a high risk of damage and needs to react to adversarial actions in real-time. The operation decisions are numerous including vehicle reconfiguration, relocation, damage recovery, and dispatch decisions. Given the limited resources and time delays in the operation, decision effectiveness and foresightedness are necessities, which require a good understanding of the adversary, close collaboration among commanders, and breaking of the equilibrium between adversaries. To capture these characteristics, we formulate an intelligent agent-based model for the decision-making process during fleet operations by combining real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. With continuous updating of learning models, the intelligent agents refine their decisions during interactions with the environment and other agents, and evolve their competition strategies according to adversarial historical behaviors. With the same level of resources, the conventional fleet wins when the dispatch decisions are stochastic. However, once each fleets start to learn from each other’s behavior, the modular fleet outperforms the conventional fleet. The strategic and operational benefits of fleet modularity are revealed and discussed in terms of win rate, adaptability, unpredictability and damage recovery.

                  This paper solves the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocities. A robust controller is proposed by employing a neural network, command filtered backstepping method, and adaptive control method. Moreover, all tracking errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded on the basis of the Lyapunov Theorem. The findings of the study are summarized as follows: (i) The uncertainty dynamics of the control system are estimated and approximated by the neural network and state predictors, which allows the designed controller to be easily applied in practice. (ii) To accurately acquire the velocities of the control system, a neuro-adaptive observer is proposed to obtain the unavailable velocities. (iii) A filtered compensation loop is built to decrease filtered signal error, which is caused by the second-order filter. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control scheme in consideration of external disturbances.

                  In this paper neural-network (NN) based adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme has been designed for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) which are subjected to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and unknown dynamics. First, some control preliminaries and assumptions along with AUV kinematic & kinetic models and trajectory tracking problems are elaborated. Secondly, the tracking error model and tracking guidance law are derived based on the theory of relative motion and the principle of approach angle respectively. Then the kinematic controller is designed by using the backstepping technique and Lyapunov theory. Similarly, AUV kinetic controller is designed by using the NN compensation and adaptive estimation techniques which is termed as NN-based adaptive controller (NNAC). Pertinently, a novel bounded saturation function has been developed to describe the unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation. The NN is adopted to approximate the complex AUV hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities. The bound of the generalized disturbance, which is composed of NN approximation error and ocean disturbances, are approximated based on the adaptive estimation technique. To analyze the stability of the developed NNAC, Lyapunov theory and backstepping technique are utilized by considering the control actions on different saturation sections. Finally, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NNAC are validated through two sets of comparative simulation studies.

                  The proliferation of ride sharing systems is a major drive in the advancement of autonomous and electric vehicle technologies. This paper considers the joint routing, battery charging, and pricing problem faced by a profit-maximizing transportation service provider that operates a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. We first establish the static planning problem by considering time-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While the static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even if consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a static policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits. To accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy availability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the autonomous fleet given the need to generate integer allocations, a real-time policy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on full state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic program. However, we argue that it is intractable to exactly solve for the optimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep reinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy. The two case studies we conducted in Manhattan and San Francisco demonstrate the efficacy of our real-time policy in terms of network stability and profits, while keeping the queue lengths up to 200 times less than the static policy.

Lodging is a primary threat to rice production, decreasing rice yield, and quality. Lodging assessment is a tedious task and requires heavy labor and a long duration due to the vast land areas involved. Newly developed autonomous crop scouting techniques have shown promise in mapping crop fields without any human interaction. By combining autonomous scouting and lodged rice detection with edge computing, it is possible to estimate rice lodging faster and at a much lower cost than previous methods. This study presents an adaptive crop scouting mechanism for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We simulate UAV crop scouting of rice fields at multiple levels using deep neural networks and real UAV energy profiles, focusing on areas with high lodging. Using the proposed method, we can scout rice fields 36% faster than conventional scouting methods at 99.25% accuracy.",autonomous vehicle

                  The evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems in recent times necessitates the development of self-awareness in agents. Before the intensive use of Machine Learning, the detection of abnormalities was manually programmed by checking every variable and creating huge nested conditions that are very difficult to track. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to develop self-awareness in autonomous vehicles that mainly focuses on detecting abnormal situations around the considered agents. Multi-sensory time-series data from the vehicles are used to develop the data-driven Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) models used for future state prediction and the detection of dynamic abnormalities. Moreover, an initial level collective awareness model that can perform joint anomaly detection in co-operative tasks is proposed.
                  The GNG algorithm learns the DBN models’ discrete node variables; probabilistic transition links connect the node variables. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is applied to predict future states and detect when the vehicle is potentially misbehaving using learned DBNs as filter parameters.
                  In this paper, datasets from real experiments of autonomous vehicles performing various tasks used to learn and test a set of switching DBN models.

Diverse evidence needs to be combined in a rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs, by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes evidence from operational testing even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims. Objective We revisit the problem of using operational testing to demonstrate high reliability. We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example. AVs are making their debut on public roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed. We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV type, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method We apply new theorems extending our Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI) approach, which exploit the rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse associated (we argue) with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results Prior knowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong expectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating the trend of disengagements (take-overs by human drivers) is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge that an AV has moved to a “less stressful” environment. Conclusion While some reliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, our CBI approach removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments. Useful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.",autonomous vehicle

While the nested logit (NL) model is the classical way to address the question, this study presents multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) as an alternative framework, and discusses its theoretical foundation, empirical performance, and behavioral intuition. We first demonstrate that the MTLDNNs are theoretically more general than the NL models because of MTLDNNs’ automatic feature learning, flexible regularizations, and diverse architectures. By analyzing the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we illustrate that the MTLDNNs outperform the NL models in terms of prediction accuracy but underperform in terms of cross-entropy losses. To interpret the MTLDNNs, we compute the elasticities and visualize the relationship between choice probabilities and input variables. The MTLDNNs reveal that AVs mainly substitute driving and ride hailing, and that the variables specific to AVs are more important than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this work demonstrates that MTLDNNs are theoretically appealing in leveraging the information shared by RP and SP and capable of revealing meaningful behavioral patterns, although its performance gain over the classical NL model is still limited. To improve upon this work, future studies can investigate the inconsistency between prediction accuracy and cross-entropy losses, novel MTLDNN architectures, regularization design for the RP-SP question, MTLDNN applications to other choice scenarios, and deeper theoretical connections between choice models and the MTLDNN framework.

                  The success of autonomous vehicles (

                        s
                     ) depends upon the effectiveness of sensors being used and the accuracy of communication links and technologies being employed. But these sensors and communication links have great security and safety concerns as they can be attacked by an adversary to take the control of an autonomous vehicle by influencing their data. Especially during the state estimation process for monitoring of autonomous vehicles' dynamics system, these concerns require immediate and effective solution. In this paper we present a new adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) that can be used to maximize the robustness of autonomous vehicle dynamics in the presence of these attacks. In this approach the adversary tries to insert defective data to the autonomous vehicle's sensor readings so that it can disrupt the safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles traveling on the road. The attacker tries to make sure that there is no more safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles, thus it may lead to the road accidents. Further attacker can also add fake data in such a way that it leads to reduced traffic flow on the road. On the other hand, autonomous vehicle will try to defend itself from these types of attacks by maintaining the safe and optimal distance i.e. by minimizing the deviation so that adversary does not succeed in its mission. This attacker-autonomous vehicle action reaction can be studied through the game theory formulation with incorporating the deep learning tools. Each autonomous vehicle will use Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to find out the anticipated distance variation resulting from its actions and input this to the new deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) which attempts to reduce the variation in distance. Whereas attacker also chooses deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) and wants to maximize the distance variation between the autonomous vehicles.

                  This study presents the problem of tracking control for underactuated autonomous marine vehicle in condition to uncertainty dynamic and unavailable velocity. A robust controller for tracking control is designed by employing backstepping method, multi-layer neural network, and adaptive control technique. Moreover, the all error variables are guaranteed time-varying bounded based on Lyapunov synthesis. The biological dynamic model are employed to acquire the derivatives of virtual variables such that reduce explosion of complexity of traditional backstepping method. The designed control system does not acknowledge any priori parameters, which include hydrodynamic damping and model parameters. The nonlinear observer is designed to overcome the difficulty of unavailable velocity. Finally, the results of calculation and simulation indicate that proposed controller has better tracking performance for underactuated autonomous marine vehicle.

                  Given the recent advances in computer vision, image processing and control systems, self-driving vehicles has been one of the most promising and challenging research topics nowadays. The design of vision-based robust controllers to keep an autonomous car in the center of the lane, despite uncertainties and disturbances, is still an ongoing challenge. This paper presents a hybrid control architecture that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Robust Linear Quadratic Regulator (RLQR) for vision-based lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. Evolutionary estimation is used to model the vehicle uncertainties. For performance comparison, a DRL method and three other hybrid controllers are also evaluated. The inputs for each controller are real-time semantically segmented RGB camera images which serve as the basis to calculate continuous steering actions to keep the vehicle on the center of the lane with a constant velocity. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid RLQR with evolutionary estimation of uncertainties architecture outperforms the other algorithms implemented. It presents lower tracking errors, smoother steering inputs, total collision avoidance and better generalization in new urban environments. Furthermore, it significantly decreases the required training time.

                  Functional control is key for any autonomous robot, linking high-level artificial intelligence with the robot actuators. Due to environmental disturbances, model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamic systems, reliable functional control is essential and improvements in the controller design can significantly benefit the overall vehicle performance. Even though there are many published studies considering the design of various advanced controllers, most of them are not evaluated in physical experiments. In this research, four different control strategies have been investigated: Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control (PID), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), Backstepping Control (BC) and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The performances of these four controllers were simulated initially and evaluated by practical experiments in different conditions, including various environmental disturbances and hydrodynamic coefficients. The main contributions are as follows: Firstly, this paper reports a comparison study between different types of controllers based on simulations and physical experiments in various conditions; Secondly, this paper provides an improved SMC algorithm combining the merits from linear control and nonlinear control, and a customized second-order FLC method.

                  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are cooperative systems and processes that use: artificial intelligence, cognitive methods, cloud technologies, cooperative vehicle-to-everything-communications (V2X), software–hardwareplatforms, sensor platforms and incipient intelligent transport infrastructures, to get self-driving systems and smart connected mobility services. This paper, to support automated driving systems (assisted, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles), introduces a cognitive layer called Associated Reality to enhance the involved information, knowledge and communication processes. The architecture defined includes an augmented Local Dynamic Map, with complementary layers, and an augmented Graph Database, with complementary semantic–cognitive relations, for the considered purpose, in cooperative human–machine and machine–machine systems. Virtual augmented landmarks are defined to improve the connectivity and intelligence of the involved spatial-information systems. Different structure landmarks and sequence landmarks (which includes regular, repetitive and periodic landmarks) are defined, categorized and used in diverse visual localization and mapping scenarios, for autonomous driving. In this paper, it is also shown, as a proof-of-concept for vehicle localization and mapping in road tunnels, the visual detection of different sequences of periodic luminaires, using YOLO v3 for the corresponding LED lights detection, or a specific alternative procedure developed with very low computational cost.

                  During the last decade, a series of autonomous vessels projects have been conducted strengthening the vision of the positive impacts on human safety, cost savings and environmental protection using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on data fused algorithms from various sensors. Although these projects have demonstrated the technological feasibility of this idea, the hypothesis that autonomous ships will be safer needs to be tested and safety constraints must be established. The main objective of this paper is to determine the hazards for the system as a function of the vessel’s autonomy level. This is accomplished by implementing the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) on specific levels of increasing autonomy, as described by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), where the human element is limited to remote monitoring and the on-board control system makes most of the decisions and takes most of the actions. STPA assumes that accidents are caused by unsafe interactions among system components, none of which may have failed. STPA presents an advantage over other hazard analysis tools, by being more flexible in terms of required information and by having a top-down functional model approach. The STPA’s results are used to determine how hazard occurrence changes, considering the interactions among system components and hard to identify failure points. These results will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that autonomous shipping will be safer and potentially contribute to the ongoing discussion for the regulatory framework that must be implemented for autonomous shipping to become a large-scale reality.

                  The simultaneous growth of textual data and the advancements within Text Analytics enables organisations to exploit this kind of unstructured data, and tap into previously hidden knowledge. However, the utilisation of this valuable resource is still insufficiently unveiled in terms of transport policy decision-making. This research aims to further examine the potential of textual big data analytics in transportation through a real-life case study. The case study, framed together with the Danish Road Directorate or Vejdirektoratet, was designed to assess public opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars in Denmark. Traditionally, the opinion of the public has often been captured by means of surveys for the problem owner. Our study provides demonstrations in which opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars is examined through the analysis of newspaper articles and tweets using topic modelling, document classification, and sentiment analysis. In this way, the research attends to the collective as well as individualised characteristics of public opinion. The analyses establish that Text Analytics may be used as a complement to surveys, in order to extract additional knowledge which may not be captured through the use of surveys. In this regard, the Danish Road Directorate could find the usefulness while understanding the barriers in the results generated from our study, for supplementing their future data collection strategies. However there are also some methodological limitations that need to be addressed before a broader adoption of textual big data analytics for transport policy decision-making may take place.

                  Recent advances in machine learning, especially techniques such as deep neural networks, are enabling a range of emerging applications. One such example is autonomous driving, which often relies on deep learning for perception. However, deep learning-based perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of subtle adversarial manipulations of images. Nevertheless, the vast majority of such demonstrations focus on perception that is disembodied from end-to-end control. We present novel end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation, using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in which they are highly effective. We define several objective functions that quantify the success of an attack and develop techniques based on Bayesian Optimization to efficiently traverse the search space of higher dimensional attacks. Additionally, we define a novel class of hijacking attacks, where painting lines on the road cause the driverless car to follow a target path. Through the use of network deconvolution, we provide insights into the successful attacks, which appear to work by mimicking activations of entirely different scenarios.

                  The Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) is a kind of small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) used in detection of seabed resources. Based on directed commination topology, this paper investigates the problem of distributed finite-time fault-tolerant containment control for multiple OBFN systems in presence of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults. By choosing the nonsingular fast terminal sliding surface and defining the containment error variables, a distributed finite-time containment control method is designed, so as to make the states of the multiple OBFN systems converge to the sliding surface in finite time. The thruster faults, model uncertainties, and external disturbances are considered together and estimated by utilizing Neural Networks (NNs). An adaptive law is designed to compensate the upper bounds of estimation error. Based on the graph theory and matrix theory, it is demonstrated that the follower OBFNs could enter the convex hull formed by the leader OBFNs in finite time through using the Lyapunov approach. Numerical simulation is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

                  Deep neural network is the main research branch in artificial intelligence and suitable for many decision-making fields. Autonomous driving and unmanned vehicle often depend on deep neural networks for accurate and reliable detection, classification, and ranging of surrounding objects in real on-road environments, either locally or by swarm intelligence among distributed nodes via 5G channel. But, it has been demonstrated that deep neural networks are vulnerable to well-designed adversarial examples that are imperceptible to human eyes in computer vision tasks. It is valuable to study the vulnerability for enhancing the robustness of neural networks. However, existing adversarial examples against object detection models are image-dependent, so in this paper, we implement adversarial attacks against object detection models using universal perturbations. We find the cross-task, cross-model, and cross-dataset transferability of universal perturbations, we train universal perturbations generator firstly and then add the universal perturbations to the target images in two ways: resizing and pile-up, in order to solve the problem that universal perturbations cannot be directly applied to attack object detection models. We use the transferability of universal perturbations to attack black-box object detection models. In this way, the time cost of generating adversarial examples is reduced. A series of experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrating the feasibility of cross-task attacks and proving the effectiveness of our attack on two representative object detectors: regression-based models like YOLOv3 and proposal-based models like Faster R-CNN.

                  This paper investigates fault-tolerant tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with rudders faults and ocean current disturbance. The adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is adopted to transform the fault-tolerant tracking control problem into an optimal control problem. Two neural-network estimators (NNEs) are designed to estimate rudders faults and ocean current disturbance respectively. The estimated rudders faults and the estimated ocean current disturbance are utilized to construct the performance index function. By using policy iteration (PI), critic neural network and action neural network are constructed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The error tracking system of AUV is guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in this paper.

                  This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework, termed as motion-aid feature calibration network (MFCN), for video object detection. The key idea is to leverage on the temporal coherence of video features while considering their motion patterns as captured by optical flow. To boost detection accuracy, the framework aggregates the calibrated features both at pixel and instance levels across frames to achieve improved robustness despite appearance variations. The aggregation and calibration are efficiently and adaptively conducted based on an integrated optical flow network. Meanwhile, the entire architecture of the proposed method is end-to-end, thus significantly improving its training and inference efficiency when compared to multi-stage methods for video object detection. Evaluations on KITTI and ImageNet VID indicate that MFCN can improve the results of a strong still-image detector by 11.2% and 7.31% respectively. MFCN also outperforms other competitive video object detectors and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and runtime speed, demonstrating its potential for use in autonomous driving systems.

                  Background
                  Many studies have found that eye movement behavior provides a real-time index of mental activity. Risk management architectures embedded in autonomous vehicles fail to include human cognitive aspects. We set out to evaluate whether eye movements during a risk driving detection task are able to predict risk situations.
               
                  Methods
                  Thirty-two normally sighted subjects (15 female) saw 20 clips of recorded driving scenes while their gaze was tracked. They reported when they considered the car should brake, anticipating any hazard. We applied both a mixed-effect logistic regression model and feedforward neural networks between hazard reports and eye movement descriptors.
               
                  Results
                  All subjects reported at least one major collision hazard in each video (average 3.5 reports).We found that hazard situations were predicted by larger saccades, more and longer fixations, fewer blinks, and a smaller gaze dispersion in both horizontal and vertical dimensions.Performance between models incorporating a different combination of descriptors was compared running a test equality of receiver operating characteristic areas. Feedforward neural networks outperformed logistic regressions in accuracies. The model including saccadic magnitude, fixation duration, dispersion in ×, and pupil returned the highest ROC area (0.73).
               
                  Conclusion
                  We evaluated each eye movement descriptor successfully and created separate models that predicted hazard events with an average efficacy of 70% using both logistic regressions and feedforward neural networks.The use of driving simulators and hazard detection videos can be considered a reliable methodology to study risk prediction.

                  Autonomous driving technologies are advancing rapidly, and determining when consumers ride in driverless vehicles on a daily basis is becoming essential. Using choice experiments, first, we elicit consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for autonomous driving systems in Japan along with their WTP for hybrid and electric engines. We found in this study that the Japanese consumers’ WTP is, on average, lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market. Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems. We find that social dilemma may occur because people tend not want to buy “moral” AVs. Third, we explored the determinants of the WTP and social dilemma to find that the credibility of AVs is determined to be a critical factor for the social dilemma.

                  In this paper, we address the problem of long-term visual object tracking and we present an efficient real-time single object tracking system suitable for integration in autonomous platforms that need to encompass intelligent capabilities. We propose a novel long-term tracking framework for classification based re-detection and tracking, that incorporates state estimation, object re-identification and automated management of tracking and detection results. Our method integrates a novel object re-identification technique which efficiently filters a number of detection candidates and systematically corrects the tracking results. Through extensive experimental validation on the UAV123, UAV20L and TLP datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and its advantage over several state-of-the art trackers. The results furthermore highlight the proposed tracker’s ability to handle challenges arising from real-world and long-term scenarios, such as variations in pose, scale, occlusions and out-of-view situations. Furthermore, we propose a variant that is suitable for deployment on autonomous robots, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

                  An array of pressure sensors can be used to correct the drift in inertial navigation systems for underwater vehicles (UVs) in absence of other navigation support systems such as acoustic positioning, GPS and Doppler velocity measurements. To date, multiple pressure sensor arrays have been designed, proposed, and tested to prove the concept. However, it has not been researched the inclusion of non-linearities is required in the post-processing. This paper focuses on the use of machine learning as a novel approach to improve the post-processing accuracy, including non-linearities caused by the vehicle acceleration on the estimated speed compared to the linear parametric equation methodology. A series of towing tank experiments have been conducted over an array of pressure sensors located on an UV platform. The results show that pressure measurement array requires the use of non-linear post-processing methodologies as linear methodologies are not able to accurately account for vehicle acceleration effects.

                  Vehicle detection is an important part of robot environmental perception. In this paper, a 3D vehicle detection method using a single image is proposed to generate the 3D space coordinate information of the object using monocular vision for autonomous driving. The proposed method works under the multi-task framework and integrates 2D object detection, 3D object detection, orientation estimation and key point detection into one unified deep convolution neural network (DCNN) which could be trained by end-to-end learning. Besides, our proposed method is built by modifying Fast R-CNN using multi-task learning, and thus our proposed method is named multi-task Faster R-CNN (MT-Faster R-CNN). The experiments on KITTI dataset are conducted to evaluate our proposed method and the other 3D vehicle detection methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive and could significantly assist autonomous driving.

                  Traffic light detection is a key module in the autonomous driving system to enhance the interactions between drivers and unmanned vehicles. In recent studies, deep neural networks are widely used for traffic light detection and resource/power consumption is a major concern for model deployment in vehicular edge devices. This paper proposes a novel light-weight deep CNN model that integrates the multi-backbone of state-of-the-art architectures for the self-driving traffic light detection. The MBBNet (Multi-BackBone Network) consists of three common convolutional backbones, i.e., the normal, residual and highway (DenseNet) convolutional modules. Simple ensemble of those backbones may incur high computational load. Therefore, channel compression is adopted to control the model parameters, while guaranteeing the accuracy for mobile and embedded hardware. Evaluation of a dataset collected from real road conditions demonstrate the robustness of our detection system, and it achieves higher accuracy (accuracy > 0.94 and

Model-free reinforcement learning uses the notion of trial and error, where the error is a vital part of learning the agent to behave optimally. In mission-critical, real-world environments, there is little tolerance for failure and can cause damaging effects on humans and equipment. In these environments, current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches are not sufficient to learn optimal control policies safely. On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning tries to encode environment transition dynamics into a predictive model. The transition dynamics describes the mapping from one state to another, conditioned on an action. If this model is accurate enough, the predictive model is sufficient to train agents for optimal behavior in real environments. This paper presents the Dreaming Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) for safely learning good policies with a significantly lower risk of catastrophes occurring during training. The algorithm combines variational autoencoders, risk-directed exploration, and curiosity to train deep-q networks inside ”dream” states. We introduce a novel environment, ASRS-Lab, for research in the safe learning of autonomous vehicles in grid-based warehousing. The work shows that the proposed algorithm has better sample efficiency with similar performance to novel model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms while maintaining safety during training.",autonomous vehicle

                  Small ship detection is an important topic in autonomous ship technology and plays an essential role in shipping safety. Since traditional object detection techniques based on the shipborne radar are not qualified for the task of near and small ship detection, deep learning-based image recognition methods based on video surveillance systems can be naturally utilized on autonomous vessels to effectively detect near and small ships. However, a limited number of real-world samples of small ships may fail to train a learning method that can accurately detect small ships in most cases. To address this, a novel hybrid deep learning method that combines a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based detection approach is proposed for small ship detection. Specifically, a Gaussian Mixture Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty is utilized to first directly generate sufficient informative artificial samples of small ships based on the zero-sum game between a generator and a discriminator, and then an improved CNN-based real-time detection method is trained on both the original and the generated data for accurate small ship detection. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning method (a) is competent to generate sufficient informative small ship samples and (b) can obtain significantly improved and robust results of small ship detection. The results also indicate that the proposed method can be effectively applied to ensuring autonomous ship safety.

                  This paper studies the leader-following formation control problem of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under uncertain dynamics and limited control torques. A multi-layer neural network-based estimation model is designed to handle the unknown follower dynamics. The backstepping approach, a neural estimation model, as well as a saturation function, are employed to propose a bounded formation control law. Then, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis ensures a maximum bound for all the closed-loop system variables and guarantees that the formation errors between vehicles ultimately converge to a bounded compact set. The outstanding properties of the designed controller are highlighted as follows. First, only the leader position and given formation are required without any leader velocity information requirement. Second, update laws of the neural network weight are extracted using the estimation errors instead of tracking ones, which can effectively enhance the transient characteristics of the control system. Third, the control torques are bounded within predefined bounds. At the end, extensive simulations are given for a number of AUVs to verify the efficiency of the presented formation control scheme.

                  Modularity in military vehicle designs facilitates assembly, disassembly, and the reconfiguration (ADR) of vehicles, which can be beneficial in promoting fleet adaptability and life cycle cost savings. This paper illustrates an agent-based approach to the optimal management of fleet operation and to control the resupply, demand prediction, and scheduling process. The agent-based approach is customized for modularized military vehicle fleets and applied to explore the feasibility and flexibility of modularity for various mission scenarios. Given deterministic field demands with operation stochasticity, we compare the performance of a modular fleet to a conventional fleet in equivalent operation strategies and also compare the fleet performance when driven by heuristic rules or optimization. Several indicators are selected to quantify fleet performance including operation costs, total resupplied resources, and fleet readiness. Then, the model is applied to the military Joint Tactical Transport System (JTTS). The results indicate that fleet modularity can reduce the total resources supplied without significant loss of fleet readiness. Additionally, the benefits of fleet modularity can be amplified through a real-time optimized operation strategy. A parametric study is performed to show the impact of ADR capacity on modular fleet performance. Finally, we provide practical suggestions for modular vehicle designs based on the analysis.

                  The driver’s activity monitoring has gained more consideration in advanced vehicular technology because of its abundant benefits for driving assistance systems. The driver’s activity recognition may also provide vital information about the state of driver attentiveness causing a substantial reduction in the number of fatal accidents. This paper aims to design an innovative framework to characterize in-vehicle activities using ubiquitous WiFi devices for the safety benefits of drivers. In our presented device-free system, driver’s activities are investigated as multi-class classification problem leveraging Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals. In this novel approach, we have examined the capability of the Sparse Least Square Support Vector Machine (SLS-SVM) with Baye’s maximum likelihood estimation for better discrimination of in-vehicle activities. In this framework, multiple classifiers are arranged in a multi-layer hierarchy for higher scalability as compared to conventional single-layer methods. This sophisticated scheme leads to address the problem of driver’s activity recognition with significant improvement in performance. The proposed low-cost solution can provide an average recognition accuracy of 91.5% for valuable insight into the design of an autonomous driving system.

                  The perception of the environment is key for autonomous driving applications. To increase the accuracy of perception in different environmental contexts vehicles can rely on both camera and LiDAR sensors that provide complementary information about the same features. Therefore, a sensor fusion method can improve the detection accuracy by combining the information of both sensors. Recently, many sensor fusion methods have been proposed that rely on deep neural networks that typically require a lot of resources to be executed in real-time. Therefore, we propose a resource efficient sensor fusion approach with a new neural network optimization method called knowledge-based pruning. The general principle is to prune the neural network guided by the location of the knowledge within the network that is unveiled with explainable AI methods. More specifically, in this work we propose a pruning method that uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to localize the network knowledge. The considered sensor fusion method uses off-the-shelve pretrained networks which we optimize for our application using the LRP pruning method. This can be used as a form of transfer learning as a pretrained model is optimized to be applied for a subset of the tasks it was originally trained for.

                  With current technology prediction errors in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are frequently greater than the estimated separation distance between objects undergoing conjunction. Current predictions are thus frequently false alarms, and real collisions have been missed resulting in expensive losses. The February 2009 collision between the active Iridium 33 and the inert Kosmos-2251 was predicted to have a miss distance of 584 metres, but this was less than the error, and so the prediction was ignored, and the actual collision and destruction of Iridium-33 came as a complete surprise. As well the inherent errors in existing ground-based measurements of spacecraft, a significant problem for satellite tracking and collision prediction is the lack of coverage of ground stations. Less than 20% of the Earth's surface area is suitable for siting ground stations [plus a limited number of isolated island sites]. For example, for BDS [a Chinese navsat system], inadequate ground stations and the poor distribution of the network have limited the accuracy of BDS orbit determination [1]. The increasing flux density of orbital objects is driving the community to improve orbital determination of all space objects, or as many as possible. Recently studies have determined that collision prediction accuracy can be greatly improved for spacecraft who carry on board GNSS transponders. We are developing a system using autonomous tracking devices (an application of our Pixie nanospacecraft) which are attached to a host satellite and communicate accurate location data autonomously of the main spacecraft. The data collected is sent to a central Earth station via an established satellite relay from the device. This intersatellite link is available continuously without regard to the position of the host satellite relative to the Earth's surface (e.g., whether it is over regions with no tracking stations). Consequently, positional and velocity data of the host satellite is available without gaps, allowing greatly improved knowledge of the orbital parameters and position of the host satellite versus existing methods. The attached device contains several sensors including a GPS or GNSS receiver, which allows determination of the host spacecraft position accurate to within 10 metres or better, compared with one kilometre (or worse) for conventional ground station methods. The improved knowledge of spacecraft position will allow greatly improved predictions of collisions between space objects, by orders of magnitude versus the existing technology, and yet is cheaper than the less accurate methods using ground stations. It is difficult to quantify the economic damage due to space object collisions since commercial operator might not publish all collision events, preferring to keep them confidential. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that economic impact can be severe. In addition, damage to the International Space Station is a major concern, it is the largest “target”. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to correctly identify the increasing number of satellites. There have been recent launches of multiple spacecraft on a single vehicle in which radio contact was not established with many of the objects, and hence it has become impossible to identify them. This is a concern for several reasons, including liability. Attaching Pixies will resolve this problem. Over time, the improvement in knowledge of space object position by installing the Pixie black boxes will reduce the number of collisions by improving positional knowledge accuracy and reducing the number of false alarms. Collision avoidance maneuvers can be planned and executed in a more controlled and reliable manner, reducing expenditure of propellant. Once Pixies have been successfully demonstrated then it is entirely possible that the international community could mandate the use of Pixie black boxes to be attached to all spacecraft, in a similar manner than Flight Data Recorders and Cockpit Voice Recorders are mandated on most passenger aircraft. The large quantity of new more accurate space object positional data generated will facilitate new methods for organizing large numbers of rapidly moving space objects. New algorithms will be developed to optimize multi-dimensional positional knowledge and situational awareness. Artificial intelligence would be appropriate to leverage the new data pool. Improved conjunction predictions will be facilitated, and probabilistic risk assessment methods should be applied to assist decision making, e.g. when to initiate collision avoidance maneuvers. Potentially this decision making could be automated.

                  The design of high-level decision-making systems is a topical problem in the field of autonomous driving. In this paper, we combine traditional rule-based strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) with the goal of achieving transparency and robustness. On the one hand, the use of handcrafted rule-based controllers allows for transparency, i.e., it is always possible to determine why a given decision was made, but they struggle to scale to complex driving scenarios, in which several objectives need to be considered. On the other hand, black-box RL approaches enable us to deal with more complex scenarios, but they are usually hardly interpretable. In this paper, we combine the best properties of these two worlds by designing parametric rule-based controllers, in which interpretable rules can be provided by domain experts and their parameters are learned via RL. After illustrating how to apply parameter-based RL methods (PGPE) to this setting, we present extensive numerical simulations in the highway and in two urban scenarios: intersection and roundabout. For each scenario, we show the formalization as an RL problem and we discuss the results of our approach in comparison with handcrafted rule-based controllers and black-box RL techniques.

                  Automated vehicles (AVs) receive tremendous attention and achieve rapid development. It is foreseeable that hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles in the urban transportation environment will be a long-standing state. To investigate the influence of AVs on the hybrid ride-hailing market, data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation (D2ABMS) for large-scale transportation networks is proposed, in which human drivers, automated vehicles, and passengers form three types of agents. D2ABMS goes beyond existing approaches by employing data-driven multi-objective deep learning to learn ride-sourcing drivers' offline/online behavior. E mbedding is used to represent the hidden attributes of different classes of drivers. Ride-sourcing data collected from the city of Hangzhou, China, are used to train and validate the drivers' decision-making model. Hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles with D2ABMS are comprehensively tested in various scenarios. The results show that a small proportion of automated vehicles in the hybrid ride-hailing market can significantly reduce the average waiting time of passengers. Besides, compared to the human driving scenario, the total exhaust emissions and vehicle kilometers traveled can be reduced by 12.3% in the AVs scenario. The proposed D2ABMS system has the potential to help transportation planners and ride-hailing platforms to assess their policies and operations management strategies in the era of shared mobility and automated vehicles.

                  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been employed in many applications of robotics and has steadily been gaining traction in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach for lateral Vehicle Motion Control (VMC), and explores the generalization capabilities of the approach. The proposed methodology uses a sequence of waypoints generated from a planning module of an AD stack as the input. The network has been trained to predict accurate steering commands to follow the given trajectory. In this paper we detail our implementation and share our learning experience on real-vehicle deployment of the RL based controller. Our experiments yield promising results with an agent trained on less than 4 h of simulated driving experience without any real-world data. The trained agent is able to successfully complete unseen and more complex tracks using different unseen vehicle models. The agent safely reached up to 150km/h in simulation and up to 60km/h in a real-life Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) weighing more than 2000kg.

                  Multi-view image sensing is currently gaining momentum, fostered by new applications such as autonomous vehicles and self-propelled robots. In this paper, we prototype and evaluate a multi-view smart vision system for object recognition. The system exploits an optimized Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) in which the processing is distributed among several sensors (heads) and a camera body. The main challenge for designing such a system comes from the computationally expensive workload of real-time MVCNNs which is difficult to support with embedded processing and high frame rates. This paper focuses on the decisions to be taken for distributing an MVCNN on the camera heads, each camera head embedding a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for processing images on the stream. In particular, we show that the first layer of the AlexNet network can be processed at the nearest of the sensors, by performing a Direct Hardware Mapping (DHM) using a dataflow model of computation. The feature maps produced by the first layers are merged and processed by a camera central processing node that executes the remaining layers. The proposed system exploits state-of-the-art deep learning optimization methods, such as parameter removing and data quantization. We demonstrate that accuracy drops caused by these optimizations can be compensated by the multi-view nature of the captured information. Experimental results conducted with the AlexNet CNN show that the proposed partitioning and resulting optimizations can fit the first layer of the multi-view network in low-end FPGAs. Among all the tested configurations, we propose 2 setups with an equivalent accuracy compared to the original network on the ModelNet40 dataset. The first one is composed of 4 cameras based on a Cyclone III E120 FPGA to embed the least expensive version in terms of logic resources while the second version requires 2 cameras based on a Cyclone 10 GX220 FPGA. This distributed computing with workload reduction is demonstrated to be a practical solution when building a real-time multi-view smart camera processing several frames per second.

                  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are attracting much attention from the industry, academia, and government in staging the new generation of transportation. In the coming years, the human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles would co-exist for a long time in uncertain environments. How to efficiently control the autonomous vehicle and improve the interaction accuracy as well as the human drivers’ safety is a hot topic for the autonomous industry. The safety-critical nature of the ITSs demands the system designers to provide provably correct guarantees about the actions, models, control, and performance. To model and recognize the drivers’ behavior, we use machine learning classification algorithms based on the data we get from the uncertain environments. We define a parameterized modeling language stohChart(p) (parameterized stochastic hybrid statecharts) to describe the interactions of agents in ITSs. The learning result of the driver behavior classification is transferred to stohChart(p) as the parameters timely. Then we propose a mapping algorithm to transform stohChart(p) to NPTA (Networks of Probabilistic Timed Automata) and use the statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC to verify the quantitative properties. So the run-time verification method can help autonomous vehicles make “more intelligent” decisions at run-time. We illustrate our approach by modeling and analyzing a scenario of the autonomous vehicle try to change to a lane occupied by a human-driven car.

                  The industrial world is at the beginning of a Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This era will radically change the human use of technology, with major implications for the ways people live and work. This commentary asks: will 4IR change pharmacy practice? The first three revolutions created the pharmaceutical industry and gave pharmacists a near-monopoly over drug supply. 4IR could do the opposite and create alternative, non-pharmaceutical means of treating patients as well reducing the involvement in medicines supply. If the pharmacy sector becomes stuck in traditional, linear thinking that assumes the future will be an extension of the past, then the fourth revolution may be less of an opportunity and more of a threat. The sector faces the “innovator's dilemma” when responding to 4IR. Should the pharmacy profession disrupt their current activities in order to: (i) do things better, (ii) do new things, and (iii) deter competition? To maintain its position in the medical marketplace, pharmacy needs to discover how to work with AI, robotics, IoT, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing. If the new game is understood, pharmacists may become the playmaster of tomorrow. If not, then the practice of pharmacy may be replaced by innovative new ways of meeting patient pharmaceutical needs.

                  This paper is concerned with the problem of coordinated path-following for networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles in the presence of time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. An adaptive bounded neural network controller is proposed to mitigate the malicious effect of the cyber-attack. At first, an individual path-following control law is designed for each vehicle by fusing a back-stepping technique, a line-of-sight guidance principle and a predictor-based neural network method. Second, a path update law is developed based on a synchronization approach together with an adaptive control method. The salient features of the proposed controller are presented as follows. First, an adaptive corrective signal is incorporated into the path update law design such that a desired formation can be achieved regardless of the time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Second, by using a saturation function and a projection operator, the proposed controller is bounded and the bound is known as a priori. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state practical stable in the face of time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive bounded neural network controller for coordinated path-following of networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to the cyber-attack.

                  We propose MCK-NET, a novel monocular framework for 3D target detection, location and pose estimation in autonomous driving scenarios, in which the key challenge is how to effectively mine depth information from a monocular image. To tackle this ill-posed problem, we combine the relative instance-depth of multiple corners in a monocular image to explicitly construct the corresponding depth relations between interest regions, from which MCK-NET learns to detect and locate objects based on geometric reasoning. In addition, there are two significant features existing in MCK-NET: One is to use the relative relationship between the 2D center and the 3D center projection to help locate the 3D center. The other is that the geometric constraints are established, including semantic keypoints, 2D box center and the projection of 3D center, which can enhance the 3D corner detection and improve the estimation accuracy of 3D centers. Experiments on the KITTI datasets show that MCK-NET achieves the most advanced results in all three tasks and outperforms the current monocular methods.

                  Identification of rigid-body objects from point clouds is a well-studied topic and one of the most important utilities of 3D computer vision in robotics, industrial automation, unmanned systems and autonomous vehicle applications. However, simultaneous retrieval of both identity and pose of objects is still an open problem because of the challenges attributed to the vast search space of all possible poses of an object. Further, the precision of pose retrieval is inherently hard to improve because the resolution of the pose database is limited. This paper presents a point cloud retrieval method that finds the object ID and pose, simultaneously. Unlike the traditional learning-based methods that retrieve the point cloud by matching high dimensional feature vectors, we solve the point cloud retrieval problem using an end-to-end point cloud convolution neural network (CNN) model that linearly projects the 3D point cloud onto a unique discriminating 2D view using an energy-based loss function. Based on the proposed mechanism of the projection network, the rigid-body pose is obtained using the reduced QR factorization. As a result, the object ID retrieval problem is simplified because the within-class differences caused by various poses of the object are removed. The projection results exhibit strong discriminating features based on shapes while the precision of pose retrieval is improved thanks to the generalization ability of the network model. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method yields considerably more robust and accurate object ID retrieval, and at the same time significantly improves the precision of pose retrieval compared to the descriptor-based methods as well as two commonly used learning-based methods.

                  Object tracking has been widely used in various intelligent systems, such as pedestrian tracking, autonomous vehicles. To solve the problem that appearance changes and occlusion may lead to poor tracking performance, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) based method for object tracking. To achieve this task, we first manually label the first several frames of video stream in image level, which can indicate that whether a target object in the video stream. Then, we leverage a pre-trained convolutional neural network that has rich prior information to extract deep representation of target object. Since the location of the same object in adjacent frames is similar, we introduce a particle filter to predict the location of target object within a specific region. Comprehensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.

                  In recent years, accurate 3D detection plays an important role in a lot of applications. Autonomous driving, for instance, is one of typical representatives. This paper aims to design an accurate 3D detector that takes both Li-DAR point clouds and RGB images as inputs according to the fact that both LiDAR and camera have their own merits. A deep novel end-to-end two-stream learnable architecture, CrossFusion Net, is designed to exploit features from both LiDAR point clouds as well as RGB images through a hierarchical fusion structure. Specifically, CrossFusion Net utilizes bird's eye view (BEV) of point clouds through projection. Besides, these two feature maps of different streams are fused through the newly introduced CrossFusion(CF) layer. The proposed CF layer transforms feature maps of one stream to another based on the spatial relationship between the BEV and RGB images. Additionally, we apply attention mechanism on the transformed feature map and the original one to automatically decide the importance of the two feature maps from the two sensors. Experiments on the challenging KITTI car 3D detection benchmark and BEV detection benchmark show that the presented approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods in average precision(AP), specifically, as well as outperforms UberATG-ContFuse [3] of 8% AP in moderate 3D car detection. Furthermore, the proposed network learns an effective representation in perception of circumstances via RGB feature maps and BEV feature maps.

                  Variable speed limit (VSL) control is a flexible way to improve traffic conditions, increase safety, and reduce emissions. There is an emerging trend of using reinforcement learning methods for VSL control. Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to develop autonomous control agents for problems that were previously intractable. In this paper, a more effective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model is developed for differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control, in which dynamic and distinct speed limits among lanes can be imposed. The proposed DRL model uses a novel actor-critic architecture to learn a large number of discrete speed limits in a continuous action space. Different reward signals, such as total travel time, bottleneck speed, emergency braking, and vehicular emissions are used to train the DVSL controller, and a comparison between these reward signals is conducted. The proposed DRL-based DVSL controllers are tested on a freeway with a simulated recurrent bottleneck. The simulation results show that the DRL based DVSL control strategy is able to improve the safety, efficiency and environment-friendliness of the freeway. In order to verify whether the controller generalizes to real world implementation, we also evaluate the generalization of the controllers on environments with different driving behavior attributes. and the robustness of the DRL agent is observed from the results.

                  In agriculture, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential for plant protection. Uncertain obstacles randomly distributed in the unstructured farmland usually pose significant collision risks to flight safety. In order to improve the UAV’s intelligence and minimize the obstacle’s adverse impacts on operating safety and efficiency, we put forward a comprehensive solution which consists of deep-learning based object detection, image processing, RGB-D information fusion and Task Control System (TCS). Taking full advantages of both deep learning and depth camera, this solution allows the UAV to perceive not only the presence of obstacles, but also their attributes like category, profile and 3D spatial position. Based on the object detection results, collision avoidance strategy generation method and the corresponding calculation approach of optimal collision avoidance flight path are elaborated detailly. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the UAV’s environmental perception ability and autonomous obstacle avoidance performance. Results show that the average detection accuracy of CNN model is 75.4% and the mean time cost for processing single image is 53.33 ms. Additionally, we find that the prediction accuracy of obstacle’s profile and position depends heavily on the relative distance between the object and the depth camera. When the distance is between 4.5 m and 8.0 m, errors of object’s depth data, width and height are −0.53 m, −0.26 m and −0.24 m respectively. Outcomes of simulation flight experiments indicated that the UAV can autonomously determine optimal obstacle avoidance strategy and generate distance-minimized flight path based on the results of RGB-D information fusion. The proposed solution has extensive potential to enhance the UAV’s environmental perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance abilities.

                  A model used for velocity control during car following is proposed based on reinforcement learning (RL). To optimize driving performance, a reward function is developed by referencing human driving data and combining driving features related to safety, efficiency, and comfort. With the developed reward function, the RL agent learns to control vehicle speed in a fashion that maximizes cumulative rewards, through trials and errors in the simulation environment. To avoid potential unsafe actions, the proposed RL model is incorporated with a collision avoidance strategy for safety checks. The safety check strategy is used during both model training and testing phases, which results in faster convergence and zero collisions. A total of 1,341 car-following events extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the comparison with empirical NGSIM data and with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm implemented through model predictive control (MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates the capability of safe, efficient, and comfortable velocity control and outperforms human drivers in that it 1) has larger TTC values than those of human drivers, 2) can maintain efficient and safe headways around 1.2s, and 3) can follow the lead vehicle comfortably with smooth acceleration (jerk value is only a third of that of human drivers). Compared with the MPC-based ACC algorithm, the proposed model has better performance in terms of safety, comfort, and especially running speed during testing (more than 200 times faster). The results indicate that the proposed approach could contribute to the development of better autonomous driving systems.

                  Understanding the 3D space is crucial for autonomous vehicles for planning and navigation. Traditionally autonomous vehicles use LiDAR sensor to 3D map its environment. LiDAR sensor data are often noisy and sparse making it not fully reliable for real-time applications like autonomous driving, thus redundant such sensors are used for the purpose. The array of cameras in an autonomous vehicle purposed for detection and tracking can be reused for depth estimation as well. In this paper, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation approach for autonomous vehicles which can be used as redundant depth estimators replacing multiple LiDAR sensors. Here, a deep learning based method is used with a multiscale encoder-decoder network to estimate depth. Target view among the stereo pairs is reconstructed by inverse warping the source view using geometric camera projection. The network is guided by the stereo positive–negative(SPN) loss which minimizes the loss between reconstructed view and corresponding stereo ground truth and, also maximizes the loss between reconstructed views and corresponding opposite stereo ground truth. The proposed approach shows state of the art accuracy in autonomous driving dataset KITTI.

                  In recent years, there has been significant interest in developing autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars. In-vehicle communications, due to simplicity and reliability, a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is widely used as the de facto standard to provide serial communications between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, prior research reveals that several network-level attacks can be performed due to the lack of defense mechanisms in the CAN bus. In this work, we propose CAN Bus Message Attack Detection Framework (CAN-ADF) - a comprehensive anomaly generation, detection, and evaluation system for a CAN bus. In CAN-ADF, not only various anomalies and attack characteristics can be configured but also different detection methods, and visualization frameworks are provided to effectively detect those attacks and anomalies. For the detector, we employ both a rule-based approach crafted from dynamic network traffic characteristics and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For evaluation, we use 7,875,791 in-vehicle CAN packets collected from real cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata. Our detection algorithm achieves accurate intrusion detection performance, with an average accuracy of 99.45% on CAN datasets, outperforming prior approach. Furthermore, we developed a visualization tool to validate the detection of anomalies by CAN-ADF and to find new patterns in the dataset.

                  Semantic segmentation has been one of the leading research interests in computer vision recently. It serves as a perception foundation for many fields, such as robotics and autonomous driving. The fast development of semantic segmentation attributes enormously to the large scale datasets, especially for the deep learning related methods. There already exist several semantic segmentation datasets for comparison among semantic segmentation methods in complex urban scenes, such as the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, where the side views of the objects are captured with a camera mounted on the driving car. There also exist semantic labeling datasets for the airborne images and the satellite images, where the nadir views of the objects are captured. However, only a few datasets capture urban scenes from an oblique Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective, where both of the top view and the side view of the objects can be observed, providing more information for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce our UAVid dataset, a new high-resolution UAV semantic segmentation dataset as a complement, which brings new challenges, including large scale variation, moving object recognition and temporal consistency preservation. Our UAV dataset consists of 30 video sequences capturing high-resolution images in oblique views. In total, 300 images have been densely labeled with 8 classes for the semantic labeling task. We have provided several deep learning baseline methods with pre-training, among which the proposed Multi-Scale-Dilation net performs the best via multi-scale feature extraction, reaching a mean intersection-over-union (IoU) score around 50%. We have also explored the influence of spatial-temporal regularization for sequence data by leveraging on feature space optimization (FSO) and 3D conditional random field (CRF). Our UAVid website and the labeling tool have been published online (https://uavid.nl/).

                  This paper presents an algorithm for docking a torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We propose a new docking assessment algorithm comprising three phases: depth tracking, docking-feasibility region analysis, and docking-success probability evaluation. For depth-tracking analysis, a neural network-generated path is used to satisfy constrained docking conditions of depth and distance. With regard to docking feasibility region analysis, the working space of the AUV can provide a possibility region of successful docking. In the analysis, working space is expressed by a turning ellipsoid, which is the numerical solution of the maximum yawing motion. An algorithm is presented to evaluate the probability of docking success, based on the probability of sensor data. A good contribution of this approach is that a criterion for assessing the feasibility of the desired path for docking is given through the proposed docking assessment algorithm.

                  In this paper a noise gradient strategy on the Adam optimizer is introduced, in order to reduce the training time of our enhanced Chauffeur hybrid deep model. This neural network was modified to take into account the time dependence of the input visual information from a time-distributed convolution, with the aim of increasing the autonomy of a self-driving vehicle. The effectiveness of the proposed optimizer and model was evaluated and quantified during training and validation with a higher performance than the original Chauffeur model in combination with the comparative optimizers. In terms of the autonomy, it can be seen that our enhanced Hybrid Convolutional-Recurrent Deep Network was better trained, achieving autonomy greater than 95% with a minimum number of human interventions.

The functions and missions of nuclear infrastructure systems are vital to government, businesses, society and citizen's lives. It is crucial to design nuclear infrastructure for scalability, reliability and robustness. To do this, we can use machine learning, which is a state of the art technology used in various fields ranging from voice recognition, Internet of Things (IoT) device management and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose to design and develop a machine learning algorithm to perform predictive maintenance of nuclear infrastructure. Support vector machine and logistic regression algorithms will be used to perform the prediction. These machine learning techniques have been used to explore and compare rare events that could occur in nuclear infrastructure. As per our literature review, support vector machines provide better performance metrics. In this paper, we have performed parameter optimization for both algorithms mentioned. Existing research has been done in conditions with a great volume of data, but this paper presents a novel approach to correlate nuclear infrastructure data samples where the density of probability is very low. This paper also identifies the respective motivations and distinguishes between benefits and drawbacks of the selected machine learning algorithms.",autonomous vehicle

                  Recent advances in artificial intelligence and wireless communication technologies have created great potential to reduce congestion in urban networks. In this research, we develop a stochastic analytical model for optimal control of communicant autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at smart intersections. We present the automated network fundamental diagram (ANFD) as a macro-level modeling tool for urban networks with smart intersections. In the proposed cooperative control strategy, we make use of the headway between the CAV platoons in each direction for consecutive passage of the platoons in the crossing direction through non-signalized intersections with no delay. For this to happen, the arrival and departure of platoons in crossing directions need to be synchronized. To improve system robustness (synchronization success probability), we allow a marginal gap between arrival and departure of the consecutive platoons in crossing directions to make up for operational error in the synchronization process. We then develop a stochastic traffic model for the smart intersections. Our results show that the effects of increasing the platoon size and the marginal gap length on the network capacity are not always positive. In fact, the capacity can be maximized by optimizing these cooperative control variables. We analytically solve the traffic optimization problem for the platoon size and marginal gap length and derive a closed-form solution for a normal distribution of the operational error. The performance of the network with smart intersections is presented by a stochastic ANFD, derived analytically and verified numerically using the results of a simulation model. The simulation results show that optimizing the control variables increases the capacity by 138% when the error standard deviation is 0.1 s.

                  As self-driving vehicles become increasingly popular, new generations of attackers will seek to exploit vulnerabilities introduced by the technologies that underpin such vehicles for a range of motivations (e.g. curiosity, criminally-motivated, financially-motivated and state-sponsored). For example, vulnerabilities in self-driving vehicles may be exploited to be used in terrorist attacks such as driving into places of mass gatherings (i.e. using driverless vehicles as weapons to cause death or serious bodily injury). This survey presents a categorized summary of security methodologies developed to secure sensing, positioning, vision, and network technologies that can be equipped in driverless-vehicles. These technologies have the potential to benefit their security from tailored machine learning models. Future research opportunities are also identified.

                  In this paper, we define and investigate a novel model-free deep reinforcement learning framework to solve the taxi dispatch problem. The framework can be used to redistribute vehicles when the travel demand and taxi supply is either spatially or temporally imbalanced in a transportation network. While previous works mostly focus on using model-based methods, the goal of this paper is to explore the policy-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm as a model-free method to optimize the rebalancing strategy. In particular, we propose an actor-critic algorithm with feed-forward neural networks as approximations of both policy and value functions, where the policy function provides the optimal dispatch strategy and the value function estimates the expected costs at each time stamp. Our numerical studies show that the algorithm converges to the theoretical upper bound with less than 4% optimality gap, whether the system dynamics are deterministic or stochastic. We also investigate the scenario where we consider user priority and fairness, and the results indicate that our learned policy is capable of producing a superior strategy that balances equity, cancellation, and level of service when user priority is considered.

                  The advent of autonomous cars, drones, and ships, the complexity of these systems is increasing, challenging risk analysis and risk mitigation, since the incorporation of software failures intro traditional risk analysis currently is difficult. Current methods that attempt software risk analysis, consider the interaction with hardware and software only superficially. These methods are often inconsistent regarding the level of analysis and cover often only selected software failures. This paper is a follow-up article of Thieme et al. [1] and presents a process for the analysis of functional software failures, their propagation, and incorporation of the results in traditional risk analysis methods, such as fault trees, and event trees. A functional view on software is taken, that allows for integration of software failure modes into risk analysis of the events and effects, and a common foundation for communication between risk analysts and domain experts. The proposed process can be applied during system development and operation in order to analyses the risk level and identify measures for system improvement. A case study focusing on a decision support system for an autonomous remotely operated vehicle working on a subsea oil and gas production system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed process.

                  The unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been widely used to accomplish missions in the sea or dangerous marine areas for ships with sailors, which greatly expands protective capability and detection range. When USVs perform various missions in sophisticated marine environment, autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance will be necessary and essential. However, there are few effective navigation methods with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environment. With tailored design of state and action spaces and a dueling deep Q-network, a deep reinforcement learning method ANOA (Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance) is proposed for the autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance of USVs. Experimental results demonstrate that ANOA outperforms deep Q-network (DQN) and Deep Sarsa in the efficiency of exploration and the speed of convergence not only in static environment but also in dynamic environment. Furthermore, the ANOA is integrated with the real control model of a USV moving in surge, sway and yaw and it achieves a higher success rate than Recast navigation method in dynamic environment.

                  Autonomous vehicles have become a hot spot of the automotive industry, many cities have claimed that autonomous vehicles should be capable of recognizing gestures used by traffic police. Traditional traffic police gesture recognition methods rely on depth-sensor or wearable-devices, which limits their availability in the domain of the intelligent vehicle. Vision-based methods have fewer requirements for distance, but the modeling process is challenging due to the complexity of the visual scenes. Inspired by the recent success in vision-based pose estimation networks such as Convolutional Pose Machine (CPM), in this paper, we propose a novel vision-based human-machine interface to recognize eight kinds of Chinese traffic police gestures and apply it in the real-time recognition tasks. This method integrates a modified CPM network and two kinds of handcrafted features: Relative Bone Length and Angle with Gravity as spatial domain features, and adopt a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal domain features. To train and validate our method, we create a gestures dataset with two hours of traffic police gesture videos, which has 3354 gesture instances. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of recognizing traffic police gestures, and is fast enough for online gesture prediction.

                  A significant growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations has been observed over the past decade, largely driven by the emergence of new commercial opportunities and use-cases. This has posed new technological and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex safety, efficiency and sustainability requirements associated with UAS operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance requirements on Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS), both in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS implementations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.

                  Data Subset selection for training learning models for a variety of tasks, has been widely studied in the literature of batch mode active learning. Recent works attempt to utilize the model specific signals in the deep learning context for computer vision tasks. Companies, in their bid to create safe autonomous driving models, train and test their models on billions of miles of driving data; not all of which may be valuable for a training task. In this paper, we study the problem of frame-subset selection from autonomous vehicle driving data, for the problem of semantic segmentation - which is a crucial component of the perception module in an autonomous driving system. We find that state of the art methods for deep active learning do not utilize pairwise similarity between incoming and existing frames. We explore both active learning settings, where labels for incoming points are not available, as well as frame selection settings and find that our method selects more valuable frames than only score-based frame subset selection, or frame subset selection without label information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using DeeplabV3+ model on both benchmark as well as datasets generated by driving simulators. Our generated dataset and code will be made publicly available.

                  Lane detection is a useful technique in modern autonomous vehicles systems, which assists vehicle to accurately localize itself according to detected road lines. Traditional methods leveraged edge detection and Hough transform based algorithms to plot lines along the detected lane. Noticeably, they did not take the informative feature road gradient into account. In addition, most previous deep learning-based algorithms consider lane detection as pixel-wise lane segmentation, where only fixed number of lanes can be detected. In order to solve these limitations, we propose a quality guided lane detection algorithm by modeling the sophisticated traffic context, where variable number of lanes can be satisfactorily handled. Specifically, we first leverage chessboard images for camera calibration to calculate correspondence between real world and image coordinate system. Subsequently, we capture image regions of interest that only contains lane information by leveraging the prior knowledge and image quality scores. Afterwards, we design an end-to-end two-stage CNN architecture for lane detection, where binary lane mask is utilized for lane matching. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method can cope with variable number of lanes effectively.

                  With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.

                  Semi-autonomous cars are already on the road and highly autonomous cars will soon be with us. Little is understood about how drivers will adapt to the changing relationship with their vehicle, but to ensure safety and consumer acceptance, this insight is vital. To this end, an on-road study in a semi-autonomous vehicle was undertaken with six UK drivers. The ‘think aloud’ technique was employed and video and audio footage of their interaction with the vehicle was captured. Neisser's (1976) Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) was used to analyse the data and three case studies are presented to highlight how poor synergy between driver and semi-autonomous vehicles can occur from the lens of Schema, Action or World information. Seven key design considerations are proposed to ensure a more positive and safer interaction between driver and autonomous vehicle to guide focus by manufacturers. Further evidence for the existence of a ‘counter cycle’ (Plant and Stanton, 2015) within the PCM is found and how this relates to the challenges of using verbal protocals expressed during a fast moving dynamic task is discussed.

                  This paper addresses a state-of-the-art navigation system aided by an intelligent velocity model for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). It's critical to obtain a precise navigation for the safety and effectiveness of AUV missions. The reliability of AUV navigation-related sensors becomes particularly important, while the accuracy of sensors, especially the Doppler velocity log (DVL), which is easy to be interfered, affects navigation accuracy directly. However, standard AUV does not have redundant velocity sensors. Once DVL is invalid caused by fish movement, sound scattering, or DVL overrange, it will have a catastrophic effect on AUV missions. To improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of DVL dropouts, an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine. The performance of model-aided navigation system is evaluated on data from our research platform Sailfish 210 AUV during sea trials on the high seas of yellow sea, which achieve 0.5% navigation accuracy. In addition, the intelligent velocity model without modifying the model parameters is more flexible in model acquisition than the traditional vehicle dynamic model when AUV sensor distribution and AUV mass change.

                  This study aimed to resolve a real-world traffic problem in a large-scale plant. Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs), which are designed to use multiple vehicles to transfer materials, are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Traffic control is a significant challenge with AVSs because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time, to cope with uncertainties such as congestion. However, existing traffic control systems, which are primarily designed and controlled by human experts, are insufficient to prevent heavy congestion that impedes production. In this study, we developed a traffic control system based on machine learning predictions, and a routing method that dynamically determines AVS routes with reduced congestion rates. We predicted congestion for critical bottleneck areas, and utilized the predictions for adaptive routing control of all vehicles to avoid congestion. We conducted an experimental evaluation to compare the predictive performance of four popular algorithms. We performed a simulation study based on data from semiconductor fabrication to demonstrate the utility and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that AVSs with the proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of delivery time, transfer time, and queuing time. We found that adopting machine learning-based traffic control can enhance the performance of existing AVSs and reduce the burden on the human experts who monitor and control AVSs.

Most conventional sensing systems lack intelligence, which not only results in expensive hardware and complicated computational algorithms but also poses important challenges for real-time in situ sensing. To address this shortcoming, we propose the concept of intelligent sensing by designing a programmable metasurface for data-driven learnable data acquisition and integrating it into a data-driven learnable data-processing pipeline. Thereby, a measurement strategy can be learned jointly with a matching data post-processing scheme, optimally tailored to the specific sensing hardware, task, and scene, allowing us to perform high-quality imaging and high-accuracy recognition with a remarkably reduced number of measurements. We report the first experimental demonstration of “learned sensing” applied to microwave imaging and gesture recognition.

                  Almost every day we read about new advances in self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. For autonomous driving, there already exist established standards with six levels describing the steps from driving without assistance to fully automated, i.e., autonomous driving. While many people and industries – in particular the automotive industry – believe that self-driving cars are feasible in the near future, one may ask how feasible full autonomy is in the process industry? Is it realistic to aim towards a fully autonomous chemical plant, and what does full autonomy even mean for the process industries? This paper introduces a definition of autonomy and corresponding levels of autonomy for the process industry. It starts from an abstract definition of six autonomy levels that are applicable to various industrial domains, also illustrated by recent examples from different industrial applications such as mining and marine. It also discusses how to achieve an autonomous system in general, based on cognitive capabilities and AI technologies potentially implementing them. Then, it discusses the applicability of this definition for process industry in a first step. Finally, the taxonomy is further refined by studying some key autonomous features of two process lifecycle phases: operations and engineering, and examples for the meaning of each autonomy level per feature are given.

                  This paper addresses a filter-backstepping based neural adaptive formation control of leader-following AUVs with model uncertainties and external disturbances in three dimensional space. For this purpose, a formation control strategy is proposed by employing filter backstepping technique to avoid the explosion of complexity in the standard backstepping design. This technique can not only significantly simplify the design process of the backstepping controller, but also reduce the influence of high-frequency measurement noise. Then, multi-layer neural networks are incorporated with an adaptive robust technique to deal with the uncertain dynamics, approximation errors and nonlinear disturbances induced by the waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee that the tracking errors for all the AUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation results for a group of AUVs are provided to demonstrate the tracking performance of the designed formation controller.

                  Operating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in subterranean environments is becoming more and more relevant in the field of aerial robotics. Despite the large spectrum of technological advances in the field, flying in such challenging environments is still an ongoing quest that requires the combination of multiple sensor modalities like visual/thermal cameras as well as 3D and 2D lidars. Nevertheless, there exist cases in subterranean environments where the aim is to deploy fast and lightweight aerial robots for area reckoning purposes after an event (e.g. blasting in production areas). This work proposes a novel baseline approach for the navigation of resource constrained robots, introducing the aerial underground scout, with the main goal to rapidly explore unknown areas and provide a feedback to the operator. The main proposed framework focuses on the navigation, control and vision capabilities of the aerial platforms with low-cost sensor suites, contributing significantly towards real-life applications. The merit of the proposed control architecture is that it considers the flying platform as a floating object, composing a velocity controller on the

Two novel approaches make up the cornerstone of the proposed contributions for the task of navigation: (1) a vector geometry method based on 2D lidar, and (2) a Deep Learning (DL) method through a classification process based on an on-board image stream, where both methods correct the heading towards the center of the mine tunnel. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in multiple field trials in an underground mine in Sweden.

                  This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to immeasurable velocities and parameter uncertainties. An adaptive control scheme is proposed based on backstepping method, neural network and low-frequency techniques. In addition, the overall signals of closed-loop system are ensured uniformly ultimate boundness based on Lyapunov stability theory. The advantages are highlighted as follows: (i) To avoid explosion of complexity of conventional backstepping method, the derivations of virtual control signals are obtained through second-order tracking differentiator. (ii) The proposed controller does not require any previous knowledge about hydrodynamic damping and external disturbances, which is easily applied into practice. (iii) To solve the problem of immeasurable velocities, the controller does not acquire velocity signals by employing high-gain observer. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify strong robustness and tracking effectiveness of proposed control scheme

                  Road separations, intersections, and crosswalks, which are important components of highways, are seen as significant areas for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems because traffic accident occurrence rate is considerably high in these areas. In this study, an image processing method and a deep learning based approach on real images has been proposed in order to provide instant information for drivers and autonomous vehicles, or to develop warning systems as part of advanced driver assistance systems to prevent or minimize traffic accidents. The information is obtained from the classification of images belonging to the separations, intersections and crosswalks on the road using a new model and VggNet, AlexNet, LeNet based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). We have obtained high classification accuracy with our model based on CNN. The result of the study performed on different datasets showed that the proposed method is usable for driver assistance systems and an effective structure that can be used in many areas such as warning both vehicles and drivers.

                  This work presents an algorithmic approach to the problem of strategy assignment to the members of a swarm of autonomous vehicles. The proposed methodology draws inspiration from the artificial immune system (AIS), where a large number of antibodies cooperate in order to protect an organism from foreign threats by local exchange of information. The decentralized nature of the methodology does not suffer from problems like the need of a central control unit, the high maintenance costs and the risks associated with having a single point of system failure, which are common to centralized control techniques. Decentralized and distributed optimization schemes employ simple algorithms, which are fast, robust and can run locally on an autonomous unit due to their low processing power requirements. In contrast to standard AIS-based decentralized schemes, the proposed methodology makes use of a dynamic formulation of the available strategies and avoids the possibility of choosing an invalid strategy, which may lead to inferior swarm performance. The methodology is further enhanced by a dual strategy activation decay technique and a blind threat-follow rule. Statistical testing on different case studies based on “enemy search and engage” type scenarios in a simulated environment demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed algorithm against the standard AIS, an enhanced AIS version and a centralized particle swarm optimization (PSO) based methodology.

                  Reliable and fast traffic sign recognition (TSR) that locates the traffic sign from an image and then estimates its category is a crucial perception function for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) of autonomous vehicles. Most of the popular deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based TSR techniques advocate discriminative feature learning for traffic signs against their appearance variability. However, such feature learning scheme may suffer from the diversity of traffic signs categories, especially when samples within each category are limited for model training (i.e., few-shot learning). Here, we present a generative feature learning based TSR network with well generalization capacity and high computational efficiency. Instead of relying on large amounts of supervision to learn discriminative features, our method devotes to learn common but unique properties of class-specific traffic signs with few training samples. Specifically, we combine clustering inductive bias with a random neural network, and then exploit computational advantages offered by a fast random projection algorithm. Experiments on two TSR benchmarks illustrate that our method achieves comparable or higher recognition accuracy than state-of-the-art DCNN-based methods with less training data and inference time consumption.

                  Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.

                  Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only tags can significantly ease the label costing, because full supervision needs pixel-level labeling. It is, however, a very challenging task because it is not straightforward to associate tags to visual appearance. Existing researches can only do tag-based WSSS on simple images, where only two or three tags exist in each image, and different images usually have different tags, such as the PASCAL VOC dataset. Therefore, it is easy to relate the tags to visual appearance and supervise the segmentation. However, real-world scenes are much more complex. Especially, the autonomous driving scenes usually contain nearly 20 tags in each image and those tags can repetitively appear from image to image, which means the existing simple image strategy does not work. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using region based deep clustering. The key idea is that, since each tagged object is repetitively appearing from image to image, it allows us to find the common appearance through region clustering, and particular deep neural network based clustering. Later, we relate the clustered region appearance to tags and utilize the tags to supervise the segmentation. Furthermore, regions found by clustering with weak supervision can be very noisy. We further propose a mechanic to improve and refine the supervision in an iterative manner. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that image tags weakly-supervised semantic segmentation can be applied in complex autonomous driving datasets with still images. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

                  The supervised training of deep networks for semantic segmentation requires a huge amount of labeled real world data. To solve this issue, a commonly exploited workaround is to use synthetic data for training, but deep networks show a critical performance drop when analyzing data with slightly different statistical properties with respect to the training set. In this work, we propose a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy to address the domain shift issue between real world and synthetic representations. An adversarial model, based on the cycle consistency framework, performs the mapping between the synthetic and real domain. The data is then fed to a MobileNet-v2 architecture that performs the semantic segmentation task. An additional couple of discriminators, working at the feature level of the MobileNet-v2, allows to better align the features of the two domain distributions and to further improve the performance. Finally, the consistency of the semantic maps is exploited. After an initial supervised training on synthetic data, the whole UDA architecture is trained end-to-end considering all its components at once. Experimental results show how the proposed strategy is able to obtain impressive performance in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic data to real world scenarios. The usage of the lightweight MobileNet-v2 architecture allows its deployment on devices with limited computational resources as the ones employed in autonomous vehicles.

                  The immunity paradigm has been recently investigated as a potential solution to the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) navigation when external sensor systems and information of opportunity are not available. The effectiveness of specialized immunity cells in memorizing the characteristics of invading antigens, as well as the characteristics of the response of the host organism, or the antibodies, represent the source of inspiration for the development of an on-board intelligent system, an artificial immune system (AIS). The AIS is expected to provide corrections to a simple dead reckoning algorithm, such that autonomous trajectory tracking control of a UAV can be maintained over extended periods of time. Variables that can characterize the dynamic state of the vehicle and can be measured exclusively with on-board sensors are assimilated to the antigens, while the antibodies consist of the adjustments applied to the integration algorithm, such that accurate estimations of vehicle position and velocity are obtained. The AIS is built as a collection of instantaneous values of antigens and corresponding antibodies, referred to as artificial memory cells. The AIS is constructed using data collected under nominal conditions, when all sensors and systems function correctly and vehicle position and velocity are available. Two alternative approaches for building and operating the AIS are implemented and investigated in this paper. One relies on providing corrections to the output and the other to the input of the integration scheme. The AIS for both scenarios have been generated and tested using the West Virginia University unmanned aerial systems simulation environment. Both alternative approaches have been demonstrated to achieve similar performance in terms of significantly improving the vehicle position and velocity estimation algorithm and leading to desirable trajectory tracking and mission completion.

                  This paper presents a real-time game theoretic motion planning approach that enables an autonomous drone to race competitively against an arbitrary number of opponent drones along a 2D or 3D racecourse. Our method computes an approximate Nash equilibrium in the space of robot trajectories to maximally advance the ego robot while taking into account the opponents’ intentions and responses. The core of our solution is a “sensitivity enhanced” iterative best response algorithm that the ego robot uses to repeatedly plan its own trajectory and infer opponents’ trajectories, ultimately seeking a Nash equilibrium in the joint space of trajectories for all the drones. The algorithm includes a term that allows the ego vehicle to gain advantage by exploiting the influence of the ego drone’s trajectory on the adversaries’ objectives through the shared collision avoidance constraints among the vehicles. We also propose two methods for accelerating this computationally intensive iterative algorithm using (i) parallel computing with multiple CPU cores, and (ii) a neural network model that learns to predict trajectories close to the Nash equilibrium through offline training examples. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to benchmark the performance of our game theoretic planner and the statistical results show that our approach largely outperforms a baseline model predictive control algorithm that does not account for the opponents’ reactions. Hardware experiments with 4 quadrotor robots on a 3D racecourse are performed to show the applicability of our method in real-time robotic systems.

                  Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) meets great challenges in videos captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Different from traditional videos, due to high altitude and abrupt motion changes of UAVs, the sizes of target objects in UAVs videos are usually very small and the appearance information of target objects is unreliable. The motion analysis is meaningful to associate multiple objects in UAV videos. However, the traditional motion analysis models inevitably suffer from the autonomous motion of UAVs. In this paper, we proposed a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based model to predict complex motions in UAV videos. We regard the objects motions and the UAV movement as the individual motions and global motions respectively. They are complementary with each other and are employed jointly to facilitate accurate motion prediction. Specifically, a social Long Short Term Memory network is exploited to estimate the individual motion of objects, and a Siamese network is constructed to generate the global motion to reflect the view changes from UAVs, and a conditional GAN is developed to generate the final motion affinity. Extensive experimental results are conducted on public UAV datasets contained various types of objects and 4 different kinds of object detection inputs. Robust motion prediction and improved MOT performance are achieved compared with state-of-the-art methods.

                  Persistent surveillance in a complex unknown urban area by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is a low-cost, promising future application for anti-terrorism, disaster monitoring, and battlefield situational awareness. Based on over-simplified simulated surroundings and a UAV dynamic model, a few remarkable approaches have been proposed; however, they typically rely on non-sensor-based inputs and prior knowledge on the environment or targets. To overcome these limitations, based on simulated city blocks, a two-level quasi-distributed control framework is proposed for realizing the continuous control of a UAV swarm in two defined surveillance phases. With the support of a well-trained and corrected artificial neural network (ANN) in low-level UAV manoeuvre control for target homing and collision avoidance, several preliminary high-level target allocation strategies are designed for a cooperative overall objective based on the synchronization of local surveillance data. Then, via a series of numerical simulations, an optimal high-level strategy combination is identified. Finally, the surveillance performance of this strategy combination is evaluated under various swarm sizes and UAV launching patterns. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control framework is applicable for UAV swarm control in the persistent surveillance of unknown urban areas.

                  People in cities are suffering from traffic congestion and air pollution in daily life partly due to a great number of private cars, and always face the danger of accidents, so autonomous driving is developed by many institutes and companies especially in recent years. Autonomous driving will play an import role in the future smart cities, reduce the time and economic cost of the whole society, and be helpful for the sustainability of the city and society. A significant task for autonomous driving is to detect surrounding objects accurately in real-time, including car, pedestrian, cyclist, etc. In this paper, we propose one end-to-end three dimensional (3D) object detection method based on voxelization, sparse convolution, and feature fusion. The proposed method exploits only point cloud as input, and it has two key components—small voxels and efficient feature fusion. Instead of utilizing extra networks to transform voxels, we directly average the points within each voxel as their feature representation. To enrich features for prediction, we have designed a two-step feature fusion method called fusion of fusion network that can combine information of multiple scales and 3D space. We have submitted to the official test server of the 3D detection benchmark—KITTI, and achieved state-of-the-art performance especially in the Cyclist class. Besides, detection speed of our method achieves 0.05 s/frame with a 2–4 fold runtime improvement against state-of-the-art methods due to its simple and compact architecture.

                  Port logistics is characterised by a high degree of fragmentation, uncertainty and complexity. In a context with these characteristics, decision support can be of significant value. This study presents the prototype of an intelligent decision support system (DSS) that leads to horizontal and vertical cooperation among freight agents involved in port logistics. A multi-agent simulation model is presented where heterogeneous actions are enabled as a result of an adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm that is inspired by human decision-making strategies. The model combines optimisation modelling and decision theory to operate in a dynamic environment characterised by information asymmetry among agents and dynamic changes over time. A simulation demonstrates the dynamics and convergence to equilibrium of the interactions of heterogeneous agents for delivery and pick up of import/export shipments.
                  In particular, we answer two specific research questions. What is the likely impact of an intelligent DSS in hinterland container transport as a value-added service of port community system (PCS)? How can an optimum cooperative strategy be formulated to meet the dynamic demand and supply of freight agents in hinterland container transport and achieve agility in the age of hyper-competition?
                  By addressing these two research questions we make a specific contribution by developing an agent-based simulation model in a real-world and large-scale case study, by using a reinforcement learning model based on probability matching theory that allows simulating realistically the adaptive behaviour of agents. The results of the simulation of two weeks of container movements indicate huge savings in total transport costs and distance travelled as well as higher utilisation of trucks from the sharing of resources. Moreover, we show that it is strictly better for smaller freight agents to cooperate – a conclusion generated endogenously inside the model as a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. As a result of this prototype simulation, major freight agents will not necessarily benefit from the DSS mainly because they are already using the economies of scale.

                  With the development of information communication and artificial intelligence, the ICV (intelligent connected vehicle) will inevitably play an important part in future urban transport system. In this paper, we study the car following behaviour under the heterogeneous ICV environment. The time to receive information varies from vehicle to vehicle, since the manual vehicles and autonomous vehicles co-exist on the road. By introducing time-varying lags function, a new car following model is proposed, and the cooperative control strategy of this model is studied. Based on Lyapunov function theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the sufficient condition that the existence of the feedback controller is given, which makes the closed-loop system asymptotically stable under mixed traffic flow environment. That is to say, traffic congestion phenomenon under heterogeneous traffic flow can be effectively suppressed, and the feedback controller gain matrix can be obtained via solving linear matrix inequality. Finally, by simulation the method is verified effective in alleviating traffic congestions and reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. It could be a useful reference to Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System and Smart City.

                     Introduction: This study addressed a gap in the literature – the potential of using autonomous vehicles (AV) to enhance children’s mobility. Prior studies documented the perceived benefits and concerns about this prospect, but did not examine the features in AV and support mechanisms that are desired by potential users. Method: An on-line survey was used to collect public opinions within the United States. In the survey, willingness to use AVs for this use case was asked twice to assess if participants changed their mind after being asked about concerns related to this prospect and importance of car features. A combination of statistical and machine-learning methods were used to profile individuals with high versus low post-willingness and to identify variables that differentiated the two groups. Results: Results indicated that respondents who were lower on their post-willingness to use AVs to transport children were more concerned about how AVs would protect children, how someone could harm the children inside, and whether there would be someone at the destination. In addition, they were less in favor of technology, older in age, and rated car features such as having a designated adult waiting at destination, a camera, and a microphone as relatively required (as opposed to optional). These results highlight potential users’ needs and requirements as they think about AVs in the context of parent–children mobility practices. Practical Applications: Relevant stakeholders should develop deployment and implementation plans while taking into account ridership contexts and vulnerable road users who can benefit from enhanced mobility.

                  Both images and point clouds are beneficial for object detection in a visual navigation module for autonomous driving. The spatial relationships between different objects at different times in a bimodal space can vary significantly. It is difficult to combine bimodal descriptions into a unified model to effectively detect objects in an efficient amount of time. In addition, conventional voxelization methods resolve point clouds into voxels at a global level, and often overlook local attributes of the voxels. To address these problems, we propose a novel fusion-based deep framework named SAANet. SAANet utilizes a spatial adaptive alignment (SAA) module to align point cloud features and image features, by automatically discovering the complementary information between point clouds and images. Specifically, we transform the point clouds into 3D voxels, and introduce local orientation encoding to represent the point clouds. Then, we use a sparse convolutional neural network to learn a point cloud feature. Simultaneously, a ResNet-like 2D convolutional neural network is used to extract an image feature. Next, the point cloud feature and image feature are fused by our SAA block to derive a comprehensive feature. Then, the labels and 3D boxes for objects are learned using a multi-task learning network. Finally, an experimental evaluation on the KITTI benchmark demonstrates the advantages of our method in terms of average precision and inference time, as compared to previous state-of-the-art results for 3D object detection.

                  In this manuscript, an efficient hybrid trajectory tracking control scheme has been proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of structured and unstructured uncertainties. To cope with these uncertainties, the model-dependent control scheme is successfully combined with the model-free control scheme. Due to the effects of the uncertainties, the full knowledge of the dynamic model of the vehicle cannot be accurately obtained in real applications. Therefore whatever the partial information is available about the dynamics of the system has been utilized in the controller design. A radial basis function neural network is utilized for the approximation of the unknown dynamics without requiring offline learning. To compensate for the unknown effects like the external disturbances and the reconstruction error of the neural network, an adaptive compensator is also added to the part of the controller. For the stability analysis, the online learning of the parameters and the neural network weights are used in the Lyapunov approach. Based on the Lyapunov stability criteria and Barbalat lemma, the tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are performed over a four-degree of freedom autonomous underwater vehicle and efficiency and applicability of the proposed control framework is validated in a comparative manner with the existing controllers.

                  Mission planning for Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) is non-trivial because significant uncertainty is present when profiling the operating environment, especially for underwater missions. Mission complexity is compounded for each vehicle added to the mission. In practice, fleet operations are formulated as separate temporal problems by the operator and solved using a temporal planner. This paper proposes a planning method that uses energy as the base planning resource instead of time. Unlike temporal planners, energy planners account for physical loads endured by the vehicles. The extent of uncertainty in the vehicle loads is clarified by using the vehicle dynamics model and Monte Carlo simulation on the model parameters. The planning method is a multistage procedure to decompose operator specified task, obstacle, and vehicle data into an energy formulation of the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) which is then solved using Discrete Strengthened PSO (DStPSO). The DStPSO algorithm has been modified to include a selective swarm size decay method that allows for larger initial swarm sizes to promote early exploration and preserves a percentage of the best performing particles on each iteration to save computational resources. The planner produces near-optimal routes containing feasible trajectories for individual vehicles that maximise tasks completed according to individual vehicle energy constraints. A case-study mission for long-term, large-scale, underwater inspection of a wind turbine array was converted into input data to evaluate the planner. Energy planning presents the opportunity for vehicles to actively monitor the feasibility of their individual plan against their current energy consumption, allowing for advanced reasoning and fault handling to occur in situ without operator assistance.

                  A robust neural network approximation-based output-feedback tracking controller is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in six degrees-of-freedom in this paper. The prescribed performance technique is employed to obtain some pre-defined maximum overshoot/undershoot, convergence speed and ultimate tracking accuracy for the tracking errors. A high-gain observer is used to approximate unavailable velocity vector which is crucial to design the output-feedback controller. A robust multi-layer neural network and adaptive robust techniques are combined to simultaneously compensate for the unmodeled dynamics, system nonlinearities, exogenous kinematic and dynamic disturbances, and reduce the risk of the actuator saturation. Then, the uniform ultimate boundedness stability of the closed-loop control system is proved via a Lyapunov-based stability synthesis. It is demonstrated that the posture tracking errors converge to a vicinity of the origin with a guaranteed prescribed performance during the tracking mission without velocity measurements. Finally, simulation results with a comparative study verify the theoretical findings.

                  Lane changes made during traffic oscillations on freeways largely affect traffic safety and could increase collision potentials. Predicting the impacts of lane change can help to develop optimal lane change strategies of autonomous vehicles for safety improvement. The study aims at proposing a machine learning method for the short-term prediction of lane-changing impacts (LCI) during the propagation of traffic oscillations. The empirical lane-changing trajectory records were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) platform. A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained in this study to predict the LCI on the crash risks and flow change using microscopic traffic variables such as individual speed, gap and acceleration on both original lanes and target lanes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in the SVR to quantify the contributions of correlative lane changing factors. The results showed that the trained SVR model achieved an accuracy of 72.81 % for the risk of crashes and 95.34 % in predicting the flow change. The sensitivity analysis explored the optimal speed and acceleration for the lane changer to achieve the lowest time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) value for safety maximization. Finally, we compared the LCI for motorcycles, automobiles and trucks as well as the LCI for both lane-changing directions (from left to right and from right to left). It was found that motorcycles conducted lane changes with smaller gaps and larger speed differences, which brings the highest crash risks. Passenger cars were found to be the safest when they conduct lane changes. Lane changes to the right had more negative impacts on traffic flow and crash risks.

                  Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are often used to inspect the condition of submerged structures in oil and gas fields. Because the use of global positioning systems to aid AUV navigation is not feasible, object detection is an alternative method of supporting underwater inspection missions by detecting landmarks. Objects are detected not only to plan the trajectory of the AUVs, but their inspection can be the ultimate goal of the mission. In both cases, detecting an object’s distance and orientation with respect to the AUV provides clues for the vehicle’s navigation. Accordingly, we introduce a novel multi-object detection system that outputs object position and rotation from sonar images to support AUV navigation. To achieve this aim, two novel convolutional neural network-based architectures are proposed to detect and estimate rotated bounding boxes: an end-to-end network (RBoxNet), and a pipeline comprised of two networks (YOLOv2+RBoxDNet). Both proposed networks are structured from one of three novel representations of rotated bounding boxes regressed deep inside. Experimental analyses were performed by comparing several configurations of our proposed methods (by varying the backbone, regression representation, and architecture) with state-of-the-art methods using real sonar images. Results showed that RBoxNet presents the optimum trade-off between accuracy and speed, reaching an averaged mAP@[.5,.95] of 90.3% at 8.58 frames per second (FPS), while YOLOv2+RBoxDNet is the fastest solution, running at 16.19 FPS but with a lower averaged mAP@[.5,.95] of 77.5%. Both proposed methods are robust to additive Gaussian noise variations, and can detect objects even when the noise level is up to 0.10.

                  The analysis addresses two critical gaps in the literature on low-carbon mobility transitions: 1) scenarios of low-carbon mobility concentrate on technological substitution and have only a limited representation of niche-regime interactions and behavioural change, and 2) detailed qualitative analysis of socio-technical transitions dynamics have limited utility in developing future projections. It applies the Multi-Level Perspective on transitions, combining case studies of mobility niches in the Netherlands with simulations of transitions pathways using the MATISSE model, by applying the bridging approach proposed by Turnheim et al. (2015a). The iterative, combined qualitative case study and quantitative simulation approach develops transition pathways including both behavioural and technological change.
                  The results show that both technological substitution to low carbon cars or a reconfiguration pathway away from car ownership to mobility lifestyles based on new public transport or cycling and walking for local trips are possible. However, while there is empirical evidence for the initial stage of a technological substitution to battery electric vehicles, transitions away from car ownership as the dominant mobility lifestyle have to overcome an established regime and will require major changes in culture and behaviour as well as support for new priorities in the institutions of transport planning.

                  Autonomous vehicles have been envisioned to increase vehicle safety, primarily via the reduction of accidents. However, their design could also affect the vehicle travel demand and energy consumption. Although battery-powered electric and hybrid-electric autonomous vehicles assume more widespread use than conventional autonomous vehicles, energy management is harder and more significant for conventional autonomous vehicles. As such, it is necessary to investigate how to manage energy consumption in conventional autonomous vehicles. In this paper, an energy management system is constructed and analyzed by using a road-power-demand model and an intelligent system to reduce fuel consumption for a conventional autonomous vehicle. The road-power-demand model utilizes three impact factors (i) environment-conditions (ii) driver-behavior, and (iii) vehicle-specifications. The proposed intelligent energy management system includes a fuzzy-logic-system with the aim of generating the desired engine torque, based on the vehicle road power demand and a PID controller to control the air/fuel ratio, by changing the throttle angle. Results show that the intelligent energy management system reduces the vehicle energy consumption from 7.2 to 6.71 L/100 km. Next, the parameters of the fuzzy-logic-system are intelligently optimized by the particle-swarm-optimization method and new results indicate that the vehicle energy consumption is reduced by around 9.58%.

                  Although autonomous driving have become applicable to the industry, the prevalent application of key techniques to the autonomous vehicles still needs to be refined. For instance, how to fast and accurately segment road markings in order to assist the next pedestrian path prediction and the creation of high-definition (HD) map respectively is useful for autonomous driving to be more practical. Current road marking segmentation mainly rely on the techniques of semantic segmentation of computer vision with encoder-decoder architecture. However, as demonstrated in this paper, the upsampling layer of convolutional neural networks with encoder-decoder architecture plays a significant role in the efficiency and accuracy of the road marking segmentation. The bilinear upsampling layer is fast due to its intrinsic simple interpolation but with less accuracy; on the contrary, the upsampling layer with offsets is relatively accurate but with more computational cost. Therefore, at least, in terms of prevalent application, efficiency, and accuracy, the upsampling layer of decoder of convolution neural networks should be paid more attention to for the next research work of autonomous driving.

                  The trend in human-controlled robotic systems is to move away from the current many-to-one paradigm, where multiple operators are forced to control a single system to a one-to-many mode of operation in which a single operator can control a large number of autonomous vehicles. For this transition to be successful, it is essential that we clearly understand how humans should interact with a large number of robots, this is precisely the problem of a growing field of research called Human-Swarm Interaction (HSI). In this article, the training of a recurrent neural network (LSTM) is proposed to model the behavior of the human operator in the task of rendezvous performed by swarms, in order to develop an assisted teleoperation system. The system is tested in the presence of humans and in the presence of faults in the communications.

                  Independently of the automation level challenging aspects on unmanned vehicle management such as performance optimization processes, adaptive cruise control systems, steering and braking controls, are related to the assessment of the operational functioning degree of relevant responsive procedures. This paper states the problem of determining both the position and the environment of fully autonomous cars for safe and efficient car routing control. An adaptive, closed loop policy is proposed utilizing a minimum number of measurements available by principal car technology, a laser sensor and a smart camera. No additional investment is required on other devices where the costly continuous real time scans can be now reduced. The low computational complexity encourages for embedded designs providing real time responses. Missing or invalid sensor information is estimated by a first approach using neural network programming. Positions of mobile and immobile entities are determined and the related environmental context within the desired vehicle vicinity is precisely reproduced. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated through realistic simulation data fed by multiple ground truth recordings. Hence, multiple biases on direct information as generated by professional drivers leading to untruthful and unreliable conclusions are now minimized. A trajectory within Paris central areas and suburbs is considered involving varying traffic conditions and rich road infrastructure. Some first qualitative and quantitative results appraise the accuracy and performance of the proposed methodology while further research targets are discussed.

                  Autonomous driving has been the trend. In this paper, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is exploited to model the decision making and interaction between vehicles on highway driving. To avoid the overestimate action values induced by Q-learning, we use the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) for the training of the host vehicle. The agent learns from trial and interactions with the environment. A simulation platform based on the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is also established, it helps facilitate the variation of control algorithms. The results show that the proposed framework can simulate highway driving, and the trained agent can accomplish the driving task with ease after training and can approximate the highest safe driving speed as defined without collision.

                  Enabling autonomous vehicles to maneuver in novel scenarios is a key unsolved problem. A well-known approach, Weighted Multiple Model Adaptive Control (WMMAC), uses a set of pre-tuned controllers and combines their control actions using a weight vector. Although WMMAC offers an improvement to traditional switched control in terms of smooth control oscillations, it depends on accurate fault isolation and cannot deal with unknown disturbances. A recent approach avoids state estimation by randomly assigning the controller weighting vector; however, this approach uses a uniform distribution for control-weight sampling, which is sub-optimal compared to state-estimation methods. In this article, we propose a framework that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn weighted control distributions that optimize the performance of the randomized approach for both known and unknown disturbances. We show that RL-based randomized blending dominates pure randomized blending, a switched FDI-based architecture and pre-tuned controllers on a quadcopter trajectory optimisation task in which we penalise deviations in both position and attitude.

Simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve remarkable performance on collision-avoidance navigation and autonomous control in the unknown environment.

                  Safe autonomous passing of intersections with mixed traffic, including human drivers and autonomous vehicles, is challenging. We propose a tailored approach that provides guarantees despite uncertainties fusing learned models and model predictive control. A single autonomous vehicle is controlled by the predictive controller via acceleration and steering angle without assumption of a global controller. Each maneuver of the human behaviour is modeled with a neural network, which enters the predictive controller formulation as a constraint. As an example, we consider a single autonomous vehicle on an unsignalized intersection, which gives right-of-way to a human-driven vehicle. We show how human driving behavior can be modeled based on real recorded trajectory data and implemented in the proposed predictive control approach by dynamically changing the constraints of the optimization problem.

                  In this work, we investigate a Deep Learning (DL) approach to fish segmentation in a small dataset of noisy low-resolution images generated by a forward-looking multibeam echosounder (MBES). We build on recent advances in DL and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation and demonstrate an end-to-end approach for a fish/non-fish probability prediction for all range-azimuth positions projected by an imaging sonar. We use self-collected datasets from the Danish Sound and the Faroe Islands to train and test our model and present techniques to obtain satisfying performance and generalization even with a low-volume dataset. We show that our model proves the desired performance and has learned to harness the importance of semantic context and take this into account to separate noise and non-targets from real targets. Furthermore, we present techniques to deploy models on low-cost embedded platforms to obtain higher performance fit for edge environments – where compute and power are restricted by size/cost – for testing and prototyping.

                  Towards autonomous driving, advanced driver assistance systems increasingly undertake basic driving tasks by replacing human assessment and interactions, when controlling the vehicle. The performance of these systems is directly related to knowledge of the vehicle’s state and influential parameters. In this respect, the road condition has a major influence on the tires’ traction and thus significantly affects the behavior of the vehicle. Therefore, a prediction of the upcoming road condition can improve the performance of the assistance systems which leads to an increased driving safety and comfort. The presented work aims to classify the road surface as well as its weather-related condition, based on images of the front camera view, using deep convolutional neural networks. In order to take computational limitations of vehicle control units into account, a pruning approach is investigated to reduce the network complexity.

                  This paper addresses the challenges of developing an embedded non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) solution for the optimal driving of miniature scale autonomous vehicles (AVs). The NMPC approach lends itself perfectly to driving applications, provided that a system for localization and tracking of the vehicle is available. An important challenge in the implementation results from the need to accurately steer the vehicle at high speeds, which requires fast actuation. In this paper we present a solution to this problem, which employs an artificial neural network (ANN) controller trained with rigorous NMPC input-output data. We discuss the development process, from modelling until the realization of the ANN controller within the operating system of the AV. The procedure is demonstrated within the virtual environment of the popular F1/10 race car, an AV platform widely used in AI and autonomous driving challenges. The results contain both NMPC and ANN-based simulations for different race tracks and for different driving strategies. The main focus of this work lies in the formulation of the optimal driving control problem and the training method of the ANN. Our approach uses a standardization of the driving problem, which enables us to abstractize optimal driving and to simplify it for the learning process. We show how driving patterns can be learned accurately on a reduced set of training data and that they can subsequently be extended to new and more challenging driving situations.

                  In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for path-following control of a fish-like robot. The desired path may be a randomly generated Bézier curve. First, to implement the locomotion control of the fish-like robot, we design a modified Central Pattern Generated (CPG) model, using which the fish achieves varied swimming behaviors just by adjusting a single control input. To reduce the reality gap between simulation and the physical system, using the experimental data of the real fish-like robot, we build a surrogate simulation environment, which also well balances the accuracy and the speed of training. Second, for the path-following control, we select the advantage actor-critic (A2C) approach and train the control policy in the surrogate simulation environment with a straight line as the desired path. Then the trained control policy is directly deployed on a physical fish-like robot to follow a randomly generated Bézier curve. The experimental results show that our proposed approach has good practical applicability in view of its efficiency and feasibility in controlling the physical fishlike robot. This work shows a novel and promising way to control biomimetic underwater robots in the real world.

They are autonomous decision-making systems that process streams of observations coming from different external and on-board sensors. CAV like any other cyber-physical objects are prone to signal interference, hardware deterioration, software errors, power instability, and cyber-attacks. To avoid these anomalies which can be fatal, it is mandatory to design a robust real-time technique to detect them and identify their sources. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach which consists of hierarchic models to firstly extract the signal features using an LSTM auto-encoder, then perform an accurate classification of each signal sequence in real-time. In addition, we investigated the impact of the model parameter tuning on the anomaly detection and the advantage of channel boosting through three scenarios. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.5% and precision of 94.2%.",autonomous vehicle

The present study concerns fire suppression in a ship under sea condition, by introducing reinforcement learning technique to aiming of fire extinguishing nozzle, which works in a ship compartment with six degrees of freedom movement by irregular waves. The physical modeling of the water jet and compartment motion was provided using Unity 3D engine. In the reinforcement learning, the change of the nozzle angle during the scenario was set as the action, while the reward is proportional to the ratio of the water particle delivered to the fire source area.

While empirical studies have typically used only econometric frameworks, we must ask the question: Can machine learning models outperform traditional econometric approaches? Using a socio-demographic dataset from Singapore, 22 feature vectors were constructed using appropriate transformations and imputing missing data to predict a 6-class categorical ordinal variable. In our comparison of six different supervised learning algorithms with the multinomial logit (MNL) model, we found that the neural network (NN) model was the most robust and performed the best while generalizing to the test dataset with a predictive accuracy score almost 10% better than the MNL. Consequently, we used an ordinal logit classification approach with neural network binary classifiers (OLC_NN) to address the imbalanced classification problem. This model was seen to perform the best in terms of all performance metrics, even in comparison with the ordinal logit (OL) model. We also used the econometric models to obtain insights into the household vehicle ownership decision-making process. Singapore’s public transport system and strict regulatory practices influenced not owning any vehicle to be the most preferred alternative. A gender effect was also revealed, along with a strong indirect income effect through housing type and job sector. Additionally, the direct income effect was statistically significant and strongly positive in magnitude. An attitudinal aspect was noticed in households with young professionals, wherein they are strongly disinclined to own a car. Proximity to transit stations and taxi ownership were also found to be significant factors in influencing vehicle ownership negatively. This research paves the way for an integrated framework that incorporates both the econometric and supervised learning approaches to better predict the influence of disruptive changes.",autonomous vehicle

Alternative traffic control measures are needed whenever there is failure of conventional traffic control or real time traffic issues at road intersection. This current study seeks to investigate the stability and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) for eliminating or reducing traffic volume in the case of non-autonomous vehicles in a mixed South African traffic flow conditions. Electronic traffic data of one hundred and twenty six (126) vehicles were observed from Mikros Traffic Monitoring (MTM) firm, a subsidiary of Syntell Group of Company, South Africa. The traffic data was obtained via the traffic technologies employed at MTM which are basically sensor embedded on road surfaces to monitor and control vehicles which passes the traffic counter daily. The dataset obtained from MTM was trained, tested and validated using artificial neural network model under signalized road intersection in heterogeneous condition by using the class description of the vehicles, and corresponding speed as input variables. After series of training, the results suggest that ANN model produced the best possible results for traffic congestion in a heterogeneous traffic condition.",autonomous vehicle

                  Autonomy has become a focal point for research and development in many industries. Whilst this was traditionally achieved by modelling self-engineering behaviours at the component-level, efforts are now being focused on the sub-system and system-level through advancements in artificial intelligence. Exploiting its benefits requires some innovative thinking to integrate overarching concepts from big data analysis, digitisation, sensing, optimisation, information technology, and systems engineering. With recent developments in Industry 4.0, machine learning and digital twin, there has been a growing interest in adapting these concepts to achieve autonomous maintenance; the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data and for in-built repair at the systems-level. However, there is still ambiguity whether state-of-the-art developments are truly autonomous or they simply automate a process.
                  In light of this, it is important to present the current perspectives about where the technology stands today and indicate possible routes for the future. As a result, this effort focuses on recent trends in autonomous maintenance before moving on to discuss digital twin as a vehicle for decision making from the viewpoint of requirements, whilst the role of AI in assisting with this process is also explored. A suggested framework for integrating digital twin strategies within maintenance models is also discussed. Finally, the article looks towards future directions on the likely evolution and implications for its development as a sustainable technology.

A developing country like India with the second largest population in the world, creates unique road scenarios for an autonomous car which requires a lot of testing and fine tuning before implementation. This leads to the importance of datasets providing information about various traffic situations in India. For planning its path ahead, autonomous vehicles have to detect, classify and estimate the depth of obstacles that they encounter on roads. The purpose of this paper is to provide a dataset for object classification, detection and stereo vision corresponding to Indian roads which can serve as a platform for developing effective algorithms for autonomous cars in Indian roads. In this work, we benchmarked the object classification by using confusion matrix obtained from various deep learning models, evaluated detection using Faster R-CNN and compared depth estimation processed by Realsense stereo camera by applying convolutional neural network based algorithms.",autonomous vehicle

This study proposes a system that aims to improve safety and minimize risk in the meeting point between road and rail, known as level crossings, by monitoring the location of floating road vehicles via a mobile device application. A neural network predictive model for estimating time of arrival of trains is also utilized.

Apart from regular communication inside the water, the applications include Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSN), military and navigation applications, diving purposes, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), underwater sports, etc. The major disadvantages of UWAC are frequency-dependent attenuation, short range of communication, very low bandwidth. In this paper, Modulation techniques such as BPSK, QPSK, and 4-QAM are used in UWAC in order to reach longer distances inside water. The fundamental key aspect of UWAC including significant multipath interference and strong ambient noise, are addressed. Equalization techniques are used at the receiver to overcome the Inter symbol Interference (ISI) caused due to multipath propagation. Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers are used in this paper. However, ZF comes at the cost of increasing the noise; however; MMSE reduces all the noise levels in UWAC.",autonomous vehicle

                  To promote the combat capability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the future battlefield, the autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technology becomes a challenging research issue. An accurate position relationship between the tanker and the receiver is significant for AAR. A novel drogue detection method is presented in this paper. The Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and the convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifier with the improved focal loss (IFL) function are utilized to detect the drogue in complex environments. The sample imbalance during the training stage of the CNN classifier is solved by the IFL function. The PyTorch deep learning framework is employed to implement the software system with the graphics processing units (GPUs). Real scenario images with a mimetic drogue on the tanker are captured for training and testing dataset by the airborne camera on the receiver. The experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm can accelerate the detection speed and improve the detection accuracy.

In this paper, we demonstrate the valuable contribution of decision support systems that combine data-driven analytics and simulation techniques in understanding complex systems such as urban transportation. Using the city of Berlin as a case study, we show that shared, autonomous electric vehicles can substantially reduce resource investments while keeping service levels stable. Our findings inform stakeholders on the trade-off between economic and sustainability-related considerations when fostering the transition to sustainable urban mobility.",autonomous vehicle

                  In this brief, the leader-follower formation control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles subject to uncertain dynamics and ocean disturbances is addressed. A robust sliding mode formation control strategy is presented by utilizing backstepping method, adaptive neural network and dynamic surface control technique. The stability of the formation control system is proved based on the Lyapunov's direct method where all the signals are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The main advantages of this control strategy are summarized as: (i) the presented controller only depends on the position measurements of the leader, which is more convenient to implement in practice. (ii) the proposed controller does not require any prior knowledge about the hydrodynamic damping and disturbances from the environment. (iii) a continuous PI function is designed to avoid the effect of inherent chattering in standard sliding mode control. (iv) the computational explosion of the standard backstepping method is avoided by the command filter based on the dynamic surface control technique. At last, the comparative simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented control strategy.

                  Increasing population and travel demand has prompted new efforts to model travel demand across the United States. One such model is rJourney that estimates travel demand among thousands of regions and models mode and destination choice. rJourney includes records representing 1.17 billion long-distance trips throughout the year 2010. Although inter-regional impacts caused by an increase of automated vehicles (AVs) has been investigated, there is little research on inter-regional travel and how longer distance destination and mode choices will change. Because of conveniences offered by AVs, the value of travel time of drivers is expected to fall, thus reducing the generalized cost of AV travel. To initially analyze the impacts of AVs in the United States, a new AV mode was added to a subset of the rJourney mode and destination choice models. With an initial scenario assuming an operating cost of AVs that is 118% of traditional cars, two outcomes are observed that are solely based on model results. First, the attractiveness of AVs severely digs into the airline travel market, reducing airline revenues to 53%. Second, the introduction of AVs results in a shift of destination choice, increasing travel in further distances for personal vehicles, but favoring closer distances across all modes, for an overall 6.7% decline in US passenger-miles traveled on existing long-distance trips. While this preliminary research has revealed an initial perspective on how an existing model can support AVs, the increasing availability of data as AVs emerge will refine nationwide long-distance modeling.

                  During the past years, camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized aerial cinematography, allowing easy acquisition of impressive footage. In this context, autonomous functionalities based on machine learning and computer vision modules are gaining ground. During live coverage of outdoor events, an autonomous UAV may visually track and follow a specific target of interest, under a specific desired shot type, mainly adjusted by choosing appropriate focal length and UAV/camera trajectory relative to the target. However, the selected UAV/camera trajectory and the object tracker requirements (which impose limits on the maximum allowable focal length) affect the range of feasible shot types, thus constraining cinematography planning. Therefore, this paper explores the interplay between cinematography and computer vision in the area of autonomous UAV filming. UAV target-tracking trajectories are formalized and geometrically modeled, so as to analytically compute maximum allowable focal length per scenario, to avoid 2D visual tracker failure. Based on this constraint, formulas for estimating the appropriate focal length to achieve the desired shot type in each situation are extracted, so as to determine shot feasibility. Such rules can be embedded into practical UAV intelligent shooting systems, in order to enhance their robustness by facilitating on-the-fly adjustment of the cinematography plan.

                  This paper carries out research on the prototype of an autonomous vessel that is normally used for passenger transportation. A path generation system is proposed using a dynamic time warping algorithm based on Automatic Identification System history data. In order to ensure strong stability properties, a nonlinear controller with globally exponentially stability is introduced for the heading controller. The least square support vector machine is employed to estimate the parameters of the control model based on full-scale manoeuvring tests. The identified results are validated with analytical values. The kinematics and control object of path-following are presented, and a time-varying vector field guidance law is proposed for the path-following control of autonomous vessels. The guidance and control subsystems are interconnected and form a cascade structure. The stability of the coupled guidance and control system is carried out using the cascaded system theory. The proof ensures that the equilibrium point of the cascaded system is uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable. Path following scenario was considered in the presence of currents based on a nonlinear manoeuvring model. Simulation studies were used to verify the theoretical results.

                  This paper presents a novel navigation method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In respect of improving the precision of navigation, recent research mainly focused on how to reduce the system model error. However, existing optimization methods are less efficient and effective in decreasing interference of sensor deviation. Motivated by the excellent performance of deep-learning, a Hybrid Recurrent Neural Networks (Hybrid RNNs) framework is proposed to estimate the AUV position. Firstly, since the different sensors have different data frequency, this method employs unidirectional and bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) with multiple memory units to handle raw sensor values in a single calculation cycle. Subsequently, using the outputs of LSTMs and the time interval of the cycle above, the fully connected layers could obtain the displacements of AUV. Eventually, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed navigation algorithm, a series of evaluations have been carried out, which are based on a public dataset and real experimental data of our AUV. The evaluation results have been validated that the proposed method can reduce the interference of sensor deviation, and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation. Meanwhile, it could also satisfy the real-time requirement.

                  Learning an intelligent lane detection system is significant to autonomous vehicles, which is a crucial module to smart cars. Although conventional approaches have achieved impressive performance, they suffer from the following limitations: (1) lane perception are confronted with different weather conditions and varied illumination. Existing methods lack a unified framework for characterizing different sceneries and (2) the inefficiency of utilizing images due to the potential label noise. To solve these limitations, we propose a lane detection framework towards autonomous vehicles by learning a full-reference quality-aware discriminative gradient deep model, where two types of deep networks are proposed. More specifically, we first design a gradient-guided deep convolutional network to detect the presence of lane, since the gradient value of lane edge is larger than that of other regions. We leverage full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) method to discover more discriminative gradient cues, and geometric attributes are exploited simultaneously. Subsequently, a recurrent neural layer is designed to represent the spatial distribution of detected lanes whose visual cues are difficult to explicitly define. Noticeably, we only utilize a small proportion of the labeled images, whereas the noisy features are abandoned using sparsity penalty. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

                  In the last few years, there has been an exponential increase in the usage of the autonomous vehicles across the globe. It is due to an exponential increase in the popularity and usage of the artificial intelligence techniques in various applications. Traffic flow predication is important for autonomous vehicles using which they decide their itinerary and take adaptive decisions (for example, turn let or right, move straight, lane change, stop, or accelerate) with respect to their surrounding objects. From the existing literature, it has been observed that research on autonomous vehicles has shifted from the traditional statistical models to adaptive machine learning techniques. However, existing machine learning models may not be directly applicable in this environment due to non-linear complex relationship between spatial and temporal data collected from the surroundings during the aforementioned adaptive decisions taken by the vehicles. So, with focus on these issues, in this article, we explore various deep learning models for traffic flow prediction in autonomous vehicles and compared these models with respect to their applicability in modern smart transportation systems. Various parameters are chosen to have a relative comparison among different deep learning models. Moreover, challenges and future research directions are also discussed in the article.

                  By development of ocean exploration, autonomous vehicles are employed to perform on-water and underwater tasks. Using an extended Kalman filter, Inertial Navigation System/Doppler Velocity Log (INS/DVL) integrated systems are trying to navigate in oceans and underwater environments when Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are not accessible. The dependency of DVL signals on acoustic environments may cause any DVL malfunction due to sea creatures or strong wave-absorbing material. In this paper, an improved version of evolutionary TS-fuzzy (eTS) is proposed in order to predict DVL sensor outputs at DVL malfunction moment, by utilizing an artificial intelligent (AI) aided integrated system. According to lack of input selection and shrinking, while the classic eTS suffers from soaring prediction errors and may result in instability, by adding these properties to eTS, the performance increases in long-term DVL outage. The proposed eTS-aided system makes ocean navigation purposes possible during long-term and simultaneous outage of GPS and DVL. These evolutionary fuzzy systems change their structure depending on the path which makes the trained fuzzy system more flexible with non-stationary and varying environments. The real sensor data is collected online with a test setup on a lake and then the algorithms are applied. The powerful capacity of the proposed data fusion method is demonstrated in analysis results.

                  Nearly 1.24 million people die every year in traffic accidents. More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0–15 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.

                  Modern autonomous driving techniques harness a variety of visual cues for performing key tasks like vehicle steering and collision avoidance. This work defines for the first time and proposes a solution to the following problem: can one precisely estimate an autonomous vehicle’s orientation relative to the road by taking a picture from within the vehicle? Vehicle orientation supplies crucial information for making various driving-related decisions. The key challenge of this problem is the lack of training data, since accurately annotating vehicle’s orientation information in an image is in general difficult. To circumvent the data scarcity issue, we propose to leverage publicly-available street panoramas as those found in GoogleMaps. Street panoramas are essentially defined by 2-D plenoptic functions that map the visual environment to a sphere. One can thus effortlessly collect annotated data for the interested task by specifying a direction and reading out corresponding pixels from a panorama. This way we collect a city-scale large benchmark TB500K for studying this problem. Our second contribution is the exposition of a two-stream deep network for attacking this problem. Intuitively, visual/semantic and geometric (e.g., the direction of road lanes) cues are both crucial and complement each other. Our proposed two-stream network can jointly learn from both cues and serves as a reasonable baseline for this novel problem. In addition, several experiments are also conducted to reveal key factors in estimating the vehicle orientation.

                  Annotating large-scale datasets to train modern convolutional neural networks is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for many real tasks. One alternative is to train the model on labeled synthetic datasets and apply it in the real scenes. However, this straightforward method often fails to generalize well mainly due to the domain bias between the synthetic and real datasets. Many unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods were introduced to address this problem but most of them only focused on the simple classification task. This paper presents a novel UDA model which integrates both image and feature level based adaptations to solve the cross-domain object detection problem. We employ objectives of the generative adversarial network and the cycle consistency loss for image translation. Furthermore, region proposal based feature adversarial training and classification are proposed to further minimize the domain shifts and preserve the semantics of the target objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on several different adaptation scenarios, and the results demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed method.

                  Corals are crucial animals as they support a large part of marine life. The automatic classification of corals species based on underwater images is important as it can help experts to track and detect threatened and vulnerable coral species. However, this classification is complicated due to the nature of coral underwater images and the fact that current underwater coral datasets are unrealistic as they contain only texture images, while the images taken by autonomous underwater vehicles show the complete coral structure. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to build a dataset that is representative of the problem of classifying underwater coral images, the StructureRSMAS dataset. The second is to build a classifier capable of resolving the real problem of classifying corals, based either on texture or structure images. We have achieved this by using a two-level classifier composed of three ResNet models. The first level recognizes whether the input image is a texture or a structure image. Then, the second level identifies the coral species. To do this, we have used a known texture dataset, RSMAS, and StructureRSMAS.

                  In this paper, a review of the literature on vehicle suspension control with an emphasis on learning based algorithms is presented. An elaborated discussion on the potentials of learning based controllers is also given. Some of the most well-known active and semi-active suspension controllers are elicited from the literature, and their pros and cons are reported. By categorizing the existing suspension control techniques and considering their functionalities, it is tried to make a ground for indicating the high potential of learning strategies for this task. In this context, several advantageous features of statistical learning and computational intelligence methods are enumerated, which can play a key role in the future of vehicle suspension control. In the authors’ view, the necessity of considering learning strategies for suspension control lies in the fact that, over the past two decades, tremendous effort has been exerted on developing smart and autonomous vehicles to reduce the need for human-machine interaction. Given the fact that the final goal of automotive industrialists is to design efficient and safe autonomous vehicles, it is impossible to neglect the pivotal role of probabilistic artificial intelligence and statistical learning algorithms. In short, by reading this review paper, one can find out (1) the state-of-the-art of the conducted researches on suspension controllers, (2) the potential of learning strategies and their applicability to vehicle suspension control, and (3) the important open questions which deserve further investigation to come up with robust, stable and accurate learnable controllers. The outcome of this paper can be of use for practitioners working on designing smart and autonomous vehicles.

                  Cameras are essential components to almost every underwater vehicle including ROV's, AUV's, manned submersibles, ocean observatories, and baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs). Deep-sea cameras are traditionally expensive components, and are almost exclusively fabricated as 1-atm pressure housings made of aluminum, stainless steel or titanium, combined with custom-made optical viewports. In autonomous recording systems such as BRUVs and biologging animal tags, camera size and form factor directly influences the physical design of the entire system and limits the operational endurance. In this paper, we describe a novel design for DEEPi, a deep-sea imaging and control system based on the Raspberry Pi family of single-board computers. The DEEPi camera is an extremely compact remote head unit (~16 ml volume), can operate to depths of at least 5500 m, and uses a photopolymer 3D-printed shell partially filled with epoxy as a pressure housing. A flat polished borosilicate glass disc serves as the optical viewport, and protects the lens assembly from pressure and water intrusion. The control computer is completely potted in epoxy, and is accessible through a wifi connection. The DEEPi system is described in detail, along with example imagery from deep-sea deployments to depths of up to 1096 m.

                  This research addresses two kinds of problems related to optimal trajectory tracking of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS): those caused by the time-varying external disturbances including winds, waves and ocean currents as well as those resulting from inherent dynamical uncertainties. As the paper shows, an accurate and robust optimal controller can successfully deal with both issues. An improved Optimal Adaptive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (OAST-SMC) algorithm is proposed here as a robust optimal adaptive strategy. In this strategy, in order to improve performance of the standard super-twisting approach, we apply an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)-based optimal tuning of gains and an underlying concept based on Time Delay Estimation (TDE). An ADP algorithm is implemented using an actor-critic neural network to deal with the curse of dimensionality in Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The critical role of TDE part in this algorithm is estimating the impact of disturbances and uncertainties on the MASS model. The results have shown that OAST-TDE significantly outperforms the ST-TDE and AST-TDE algorithm in terms of the optimal control efforts. Also, compared with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), proposed controller meets the optimal control efforts and accurate tracking concurrently.

                  Automatic ship docking is one of the applications of autonomous ships. How to realize autonomous low-speed maneuver under environmental disturbances for docking is the fundamental problem at present. This paper presents an efficient approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) for automatic ship docking. The problem is formulated and well-modeled for simulating ship docking operation. A joystick implementation in simulation provides manual maneuvering and thus enables collection of sufficient and reliable data from successful maneuvers. To keep consistent with the manual control, an ANN with two parallel structure is proposed to control the ship’s thrust and rudder, respectively. Feature selection technique and genetic algorithm (GA) are utilized to optimize the structure and reduce the training cost. Numerical simulations under different environmental disturbances, including no wind, constant wind and dynamic wind are carried out. The results show the ship is able to reach the dock smoothly, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

                  Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are increasingly being used to spray liquid pesticides to control emerging pest infestations in field crops. In recent years, UAVs have been used to release predatory mites and other natural enemies to optimise and promote sustainable pest management practices by relying less on conventional insecticides. Drone dispensed samples of predatory mites are typically mixed with a granular material, vermiculite, which serves as a filler. The low density of the vermiculite and weather conditions (mainly wind), influences the distribution pattern of predatory mites when delivered by a UAV-based system. The purpose of this paper is to present a data-driven methodology to develop a mathematical model that can be used to optimise UAV-based autonomous dispensing of predatory mites. The model characterises the distribution of vermiculite as a function of wind speed and direction, and the UAVs altitude and forward speed. The model is constructed by first conducting outdoor experiments and then using machine-learning techniques on the collected data. The constructed model produced an average generalisation error of 12.8%, RMSE. Due to its parametric and predictive nature, the model is amenable for the future design of UAV flight controllers that can compensate for the targeting error caused by wind. The proposed modelling methodology could be useful not only for the dispensing of predatory mites, but also for other UAV dispensing applications, such as liquid or granular pesticide deliveries.

                  Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) has always been a hot research area due to its significant application and complicated control problem. In order to improve the docking precision of AAR, a novel docking controller with probe direct control and learning-based preview method is proposed. Firstly, the controlled object is transformed from receiver barycenter to probe tactfully. Then, a suitable probe direct controller designed via the combination of reference-observer-based tracking control method and the high order sliding mode control method is proposed for the probe direct control. Furthermore, a learning-based preview method is introduced to solve the tracking lag problem. The prediction of drogue motion is considered in the reference signal. Then, a novel learning algorithm, named deep learning and reinforcement learning (DLRL), which combines deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) spatially rather than structurally like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to generate the preview time adaptively. And a novel preview index is proposed to adapt for it. Through the combination of probe direct controller and learning-based preview method, the proposed docking controller could improve the tracking precision largely. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulations.

                  Semantic understanding of multi-vehicle interaction patterns at intersections play a pivotal role in proper decision-making of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a flexible framework to automatically extract these interaction patterns from observed temporal sequences based on driving primitives. A Bayesian nonparametric approach is developed to segment vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) sequential observations into small analytically interpretable components (called driving primitives) without using prior knowledge. Then, an unsupervised clustering method is developed to gather these driving primitives into groups (called driving patterns) by integrating with dynamic time warping. In addition, the extracted driving primitives are used to quantitatively analyze the similarities between behaviors at different intersections using a relative entropy metric, i.e., KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence. Finally, 706 naturalistic V2V events from eight typical urban signalized intersections are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed primitive-based framework. Experimental results demonstrate that there exist 15 types of interactive driving patterns for V2V behaviors at intersections in our database. Moreover, the distribution of interactive driving patterns could characterize the types of intersections.

                  The development of intelligent autonomous cars is of great interest. A particular and challenging problem is to handle pedestrians, for example, crossing or walking along the road. Since pedestrians are one of the most fragile elements in traffic, a reliable pedestrian detection and handling system is mandatory. The current pedestrian handling system of our autonomous cars suffers from the limitation of the pure detection-based systems, i.e., it limits the autonomous car system to make decisions based only on the very present moment. This work improves the pedestrian handling systems by incorporating an object tracker with the aim of predicting the pedestrian’s behavior. With this knowledge, the autonomous car can better decide the time to stop and to start moving, providing a more comfortable, efficient, and safer driving experience. The proposed method was augmented with a path generator, based on Frenét Frames, and incorporated to our self-driving car in order to enable a better decision making and to enable overtaking pedestrians. The behaviour of our self-driving car was evaluated in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Results showed the proposed system is safer and more efficient than the system without tracking functionality due to the early decision capability.

                  The ability to avoid collisions with each other is one of the fundamental requirements for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to be safely integrated into the civilian airspace, and for the viability of multi-UAV operations. This paper introduces a new approach for online cooperative collision avoidance between quadcopters, involving reciprocal maneuvers, i.e., coherent maneuvers without requiring any real-time consensus. Two maneuver strategies are presented, where UAVs respectively change their speed or heading to avoid a collision. A learning-based framework that trains these reciprocal actions for collision evasion (called TRACE) is developed. The primary elements of this framework include: 1) designing simulated experiments that cover a variety of UAV–UAV approach scenarios; 2) performing optimization to identify speed/heading change actions that satisfy safety constraints while minimizing the energy cost of the maneuver; and 3) using the offline optimization outcomes to train classifier (via ensemble bagged tree) and function approximation (via neural networks and Kriging) models for respectively selecting and encoding the avoidance actions. Trajectory generation and dynamics/controls are incorporated in the simulation environment used for training and testing. Over 90% accuracy in action prediction and over 95% success in avoiding collisions is observed when the trained models are applied to simulated unseen test scenarios.

                  Three studies compared people's judgments of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humans faced with a moral dilemma. Study 1 showed that, for identical decisions, AVs were judged as more blameworthy, less moral, and less trustworthy compared to humans. However, perceiving AVs as having a human-like mind reduced this difference. Study 2 extended this finding by manipulating AV mindedness. Describing AVs' decision-making capacity in mentalistic terms (relative to mechanistic terms) reduced blame and anger and fostered greater trust and perceptions of morality. Study 3, replicated these findings, and demonstrated that perceived mindedness predicted judgments of trust, morality, and willingness to purchase or ride in an AV. These findings suggest that people's moral reservations about AVs may derive from doubting that AVs have the mental capacities necessary for moral judgment, and that one route for improving trust in AVs is to design them with a veneer of human-like mental qualities.

                  This paper proposes a novel approach to detect the pavement surface deterioration using tyre/road noise produced from a sensorized test-vehicle during a regular driving. The acoustic data have shown to be relevant on automatic asphalt-damage classification. In this proof of concept, four classes of bituminous road-surface states were classified, showing very promising results. The application of this technique will allow automated inspection, geolocation and prioritization of roads or street areas that may need maintenance and repair, in addition to informing drivers or autonomous vehicles about road safety conditions in order to prevent accidents.
                  With this approach any vehicle can easily become an asphalt status tester with the installation of a microphone, enabling the possibility to transform any fleet of vehicles into a networked signal acquisition system that may form part of the decision support of administrations in the management and maintenance of road infrastructures, at a very low cost.

                  This research is presented as a safety analysis of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety-critical system.
                  Cognitive technology is currently simulated within safety-critical systems in order to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves the system's cognitive performance. In this research, the safety of the architecture was analyzed on an actual safety-critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The safety analysis was conducted in both a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective was to define the safety design of a cognitive architecture. The input to the safety design was provided through an approach that identified and mitigated hazards associated with a USV controlled by a cognitive architecture. This analysis provided a structured, task-oriented approach for the dissemination of information concerning safety requirements. This approach was necessary to achieve a safe execution of the USV's capabilities through a design that reduces the potential for injury to personnel and damage to equipment.
                  Other real time applications that would benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers with a reference for safety engineering of artificially intelligent safety-critical systems.

                  Autonomous learning is a crucially important capability of intelligent robots. As one of the most fashionable machine learning techniques, the reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent taking an optimized action by interacting with the environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. In this paper, an improved RL algorithm, named as the KT-HA-Q(λ) algorithm, is proposed by resorting to the knowledge transfer of source domain. First, a BP neural network and a liner sensor network are skillfully constructed to perform the knowledge transfer of source task for weight initialization in target task, and the knowledge transfer on actions of case base obtained by source domain, respectively. Then, the novel case base expansion and progressive forgetting criterion, which realize the balance between new experience via online learning and historical experience in the case base, are developed to enhance the learning efficiency and the learning rate. Furthermore, an improved heuristic function is proposed by replacing the action traditionally obtained via a selection strategy by the experience action. This function acts as a crucial role for both the best action selection and its Q value calculation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is utilized in the hill-climbing experiment of unmanned vehicles under a complex 3D scene by transferring the knowledge obtained in a 2D scene. The results of contrast experiments verified the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

                  The Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) belongs to Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) designed for detecting seabed resources. When considering model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults, by applying the nonsingular fast terminal sliding-mode technique, a distributed finite-time fault-tolerant error constraint containment control method for multiple OBFN systems is proposed under directed communication topology. Besides, only a part of follower OBFNs can get the information of leader OBFNs. First, the error constraint strategy is considered to improve the system performance while the defined error variable of containment control was converted into a suitable form. Then, by choosing the appropriate nonsingular fast terminal sliding surface, the systems states can reach the sliding surface in finite time such that the follower OBFNs could converge to the convex hull formed by the leader OBFNs in finite time. Neural Network (NN) is employed to estimate and compensate the general disturbances consisting of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults. An adaptive law is designed to compensate the upper bound of the estimation errors. The finite-time stability of the systems and the boundedness of containment errors are proved by utilizing graph theory, finite time theory, and Lyapunov technique. Numerical simulations under different types of thruster faults are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

                  This paper focuses on online obstacle avoidance planning for unmanned underwater vehicles. To improve the autonomous ability and intelligence of obstacle avoidance planning, a recurrent neural network with convolution is proposed. In the proposed method, convolution replaces full connection in the standard recurrent neural network, thus reducing the number of parameters and improving the feature extraction capability. Training and test datasets are generated for the deep learning process and, combined with multibeam forward-looking sonar, this learning system can automatically realize online obstacle avoidance for unmanned underwater vehicles. Experiments are designed to compare the performance of the proposed structure with that of a recurrent neural network, gated recurrent units, and conventional ant colony optimization. The results fully verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, and show that the powerful learning and memory capabilities of the proposed structure can be used in the unmanned underwater vehicle autonomous learning environment. This study demonstrates that recurrent neural networks with convolution greatly enhance the ability of unmanned systems to sense and adapt to unknown environments.

                  Motion control is one of the most critical aspects in the design of autonomous ships. During maneuvering, the dynamics of propellers as well as the craft hydrodynamical specifications experience severe uncertainties. In this paper, an adaptive control approach is proposed to control the motion and trajectory tracking of an autonomous vessel by adopting neural networks that is used for estimating the dynamics of the propellers and handling hydrodynamical uncertainties. Considering that the maneuvering model of a vessel resemble a nonlinear non-affine-in-control system, the proposed neural-based adaptive control algorithm is designed to estimate the nonlinear influence of the input function which in this case is the dynamics of propellers and thrusters. It is also shown that the proposed methodology is capable of handling state dependent uncertainties within the ship maneuvering model. A Lyapunov-based technique and Uniform Ultimate Boundedness are used to prove the correctness of the algorithm. To assess the method’s performance, several experiments are considered including trajectory tracking simulations in the port of Rotterdam.

                  In an avoidable harmful situation, autonomous vehicles systems are expected to choose the course of action that causes the less damage to everybody. However, this behavioral protocol implies some predictability. In this context, we show that if the autonomous vehicle decision process is perfectly known then malicious, opportunistic, terrorist, criminal and non-civic individuals may have incentives to manipulate it. Consequently, some levels of uncertainty are necessary for the system to be manipulation proof. Uncertainty removes the misbehavior incentives because it increases the risk and likelihood of unsuccessful manipulation. However, uncertainty may also decrease the quality of the decision process with negative impact in terms of efficiency and welfare for the society. We also discuss other possible solutions to this problem.

                  Path planning plays a significant role in autonomous navigation for robots in complex environments and hence has been extensively studied for decades. However, the computational time of most existing methods are dependent on the scale and complexity of environment, which leads to the compromise between time efficiency and path quality. To tackle this challenge, deep neural network based (DNN-based) planning methods have been actively explored. However, despite the success of DNN-based 2D planner, 3D path planning, which is a significant primitive for quite a few autonomous robots, is rarely handled by DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network architecture named Three-Dimensional Path Planning Network (TDPP-Net) to realize DNN-based 3D path planning. Embedding the action decomposition and composition concept, our network predicts 3D actions merely through 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Besides, the computational time of TDPP-Net is almost independent of environmental scale and complexity for each action prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits remarkable performance for planning real-time paths in unseen 3D environments.

These recommendations not only deal with features of the AUV itself, but also with positioning under the ice, artificial intelligence for under-ice behaviour, the optimal sensor package for mapping the underside of sea ice, launch and recovery techniques and the operational scenario as a whole. We review these recommendations, and draw attention to a new technology which is central to improved AUV operation, the Stand-Alone USBL (Ultra-Short BaseLine, a method of underwater acoustic positioning) Positioning Buoy, which will enable insertion, tracking and retrieval of AUVs to be more rapid and secure, and enable in-mission low bandwidth communication. Both large and small AUVs have been used successfully to map the 3D structure of the ice underside, but always in an experimental context. The challenge now is to determine the best way forward to improve the quantity and quality of data gathering, and to turn the under-ice AUV into a reliable vehicle for routine use.",autonomous vehicle

                  With rapid development of aviation technology, materials science and artificial intelligence, aircraft design is pursuing higher requirements both in civil and military fields. The new generation of aircraft should have the autonomous capable of performing a variety of tasks (such as take-off and landing, cruising, maneuvering, hover, attack, etc.) under a highly variable flight environment (height, Mach number, etc.) and meanwhile maintaining good performance. Morphing aircraft can use smart materials and actuators to autonomously deform the shape according to the changes in flight environment and mission, and always maintain an optimal aerodynamic shape, therefore get flourished developments. Based on the ability of birds to stretch wings when flying at low speed and to constrict wings at high speed, a new bionic morphing UAV has been designed and developed as the study model by our team. In order to make this new aircraft be able to complete rapid autonomous morphing and aerodynamic performance optimization under different missions and flight conditions, we developed deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques as a control strategy. Considering the continuity of the state and action spaces for model, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the actor-critic, model-free algorithm was adopted and verified on the classic nonlinear Pendulum model and Cart Pole game. After the feasibility was verified, morphing aircraft model was controlled to complete prescribed deformation using DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, on the condition that the DDPG algorithm can control morphing well, through training and testing on model using simulation data from wind tunnel tests and actual flight, the autonomous morphing control for the shape optimization of the bionic morphing UAV model could be realized.

                  In this study, a quasi-autonomous vision-based method is newly proposed for detecting loosened bolts in critical connections. The main idea of the approach is to estimate the rotational angles of bolts from the connection images by integrating deep learning technology with image processing techniques. Firstly, a regional convolutional neural network (RCNN)-based deep learning algorithm is developed to automatically detect and crop plausible bolts in the connection image. Also, the Hough line transform (HLT)-based image processing algorithm is designed to automatically estimate the bolt angles from the cropped bolt images. Secondly, the proposed vision-based approach is validated for bolt-loosening detection in a lab-scale girder connection using images captured by a smartphone camera. The accuracy of the RCNN-based bolt detector and the HLT-based bolt angle estimator are examined under different levels of perspective distortion and shooting distance. Finally, the practicality of the proposed vision-based method is verified on a real-scale girder bridge connection containing numerous bolts. The images of the connection are captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle and transferred to a computer where a quasi-autonomous bolt-loosening detection process is performed via the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate potentials of the proposed approach for quasi real-time bolt-loosening monitoring of large bolted connections. The results show that the perspective angle should not go beyond 40 degrees to ensure the accuracy of the detection results.

                  Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

                  This paper investigates the role of business models: What differences exist between the roles of an already-existing market-based converted industry and a newly appearing market-based emerging industry?
                  This study analyzed the status of the technologies and business models in the autonomous car and intelligent robot industries, as well as their recent two-year growth, using technology and business model patents. In addition, it investigated the current situation of the technologies, business models, and markets of the two industries based on literature reviews. This study then simulated the market growth of the autonomous car and intelligent robot industries using system dynamics. The simulations were established and verified by analyzing the references and citations of the technology patents and business model patents of the two industries. This study reached three conclusions. First, in the case of a converted industry such as autonomous cars, a strategy focused on a business model is useful in the early stage, whereas one focused on technology is efficient in the mature stage. Second, in the case of an emerging industry such as intelligent robots, a strategy focused on technology is somewhat more useful in the early stage than one focused on a business model; conversely, a strategy focused on technology is slightly more useful in the mature stage. Third, a business model is also important to supplement technology such as intelligent robots at a mature stage in Canada or autonomous cars at a mature stage in Japan.

                  This paper studies the controller design for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with the target tracking task. Considering the uncertainty the nonlinear longitudinal model, a sliding mode controller is designed. Meanwhile the neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear function in the model. To improve the NNs learning rapidity, the prediction error which reflect the learning performance is constructed, further the updating law is designed utilizing the composite learning technique. The system stability is guaranteed through the Lyapunov approach. The simulation results verify that the designed method could force the AUV to track the target until rendezvous, and the model uncertainty is addressed better via the composite learning algorithm.

                  The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has gained increasing attention in China. Although auto manufacturers and innovators have attempted to confirm that AVs are safe and have introduced them on public roads, it is vital to understand end-users’ acceptance of AVs. A total of 1453 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires. The questionnaires included the Autonomous Vehicle Acceptability Scale (AVAS), the Traffic Climate Scale (TCS), and sociodemographic variables. The satisfactory internal consistency reliability and construct validity revealed that the newly developed Chinese version of the AVAS is a suitable tool to measure public acceptance of AVs. Moreover, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis conformed to the four factors of AVAS, including benefits in usefulness (BIU), benefits in situations (BIS), concern scenarios (CS) and system concern (SC). Scores higher on benefits and lower on concerns represent more acceptance of AVs. In addition, we found that the public’s perceived local traffic safety climate affected the attitude toward AVs. More specifically, external affective demands (EAD) were found to be a significant predictor of SC, internal requirements (IR) were shown to have an effect on BIS and CS, and functionality was found to be a significant predictor of BIU and SC. Furthermore, the differences between drivers and non-drivers revealed that drivers were concerned significantly less about AVs and regarded AVs as more useful than non-drivers did. To gain more customers for the purchase of AVs, it is necessary for automotive vehicle manufacturers and retailers to introduce and advertise the functions and usability of autonomous driving systems to the public. Gaining acceptance from end users and understanding the factors that affect acceptability will be critical to the widespread deployment of AVs.

                  In this study, a field scene recognition system was developed to estimate a self-position of a traveling vehicle along a farm road by using an original capture system with three cameras, a vector quantization method to express the features of field scenes, a machine learning based scene recognition algorithm, and a vehicle position estimation algorithm with an original voting method. The potential of our system was demonstrated through five experiments performed over four months. In the experiments, the system could robustly estimate the vehicle position with the accuracy less than 1 m at the processing speed of approximately 2.0 Hz when the vehicle was driven straight along a traveling line on the targeted two types of roads: a surfaced road and an unsurfaced road, at the driving speed of 0.5 m/s. The results demonstrated an applicability of our system to navigate an autonomous agricultural robot vehicle without using GNSS.

                  This paper proposes the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to guide and control an autonomous underwater vehicle into the entrance of a docking station by mapping camera input to an error signal.
                  An external positioning system synchronized with the internal sensors of the vehicle is to obtain a dataset of images matched with the position and heading of the vehicle. By using a guidance map, each position is converted into a desired heading that guides the vehicle into the docking station. The CNN is then trained to estimate, for each frame, the error between the desired vehicle heading and the actual heading of the vehicle. After the training period, the camera input and the CNN are used to control the vehicle towards the docking station, achieving autonomous docking. To enhance the stability of the docking, the paper proposes a transformation of the polar coordinates that avoids large angular errors when reaching the entrance of the docking station. The proposed framework is implemented, and experimental data from a mission are presented.

                  Vehicle detection and classification is an important task for street surveillance and scene perception for robot navigation or autonomous vehicles. This research work focuses on traffic detection for real time applications using three components. The first component includes designing convolutional feature map-based classifier based on multimodal optical flow features. The second component is to utilize an effective adaptive learning rate technique to deal with saddle points; and to propose an average covariance matrix based pre-conditioning approach. The third component is to separately train multimodal model using blur data which caters blur effect of real time data. Extensive experimental results with different learning rates, architectures are reported using benchmark datasets such as Apollo, KITTI, Cityscapes, Berkeley, Caltech, PASCAL VOC and self created. Experimental results demonstrate that in comparison to fully connected network based classifier, Network on Convolutional (NoC) feature map classifier provided approximately 10% hike in classification accuracy without data per-processing, and almost 18% improvement with pre-processed data. The blur model enhances accuracy by almost 15% on blurred data as compared to normal RGB data.

                  Conventional intersection managements, such as signalized intersections, may not necessarily be the optimal strategies when it comes to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment. Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in AIM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated.
                  The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions. The comparison analysis is performed between DCL-AIM and the First-Come-First-Serve based AIM (FCFS-AIM), with Longest-Queue-First (LQF-AIM) policy and the signal control based on the Webster’s method (Signal) as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the sequential decisions from DCL-AIM outperform the other control policies.

                  In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for fusing sensors and improving robustness to sensor failures in end-to-end learning based autonomous navigation of ground vehicles in unknown environments. We propose the first learning based camera–LiDAR fusion methodology for autonomous in-door navigation. Specifically, we develop a multimodal end-to-end learning system, which maps raw depths and pixels from LiDAR and camera, respectively, to the steering commands. A novel gating based dropout regularization technique is introduced which effectively performs multimodal sensor fusion and reliably predicts steering commands even in the presence of various sensor failures. The robustness of our network architecture is demonstrated by experimentally evaluating its ability to autonomously navigate in the indoor corridor environment. Specifically, we show through various empirical results that our framework is robust to sensor failures, partial image occlusions, modifications of the camera image intensity, and the presence of noise in the camera or LiDAR range images. Furthermore, we show that some aspects of obstacle avoidance are implicitly learned (while not being specifically trained for it); these learned navigation capabilities are shown in ground vehicle navigation around static and dynamic obstacles.

                  Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles.

                  A survey on biometry for cognitive automotive systems is presented in this paper, specially those biometric systems used for high tech security access, law enforcement and/or commercial transactions. In general, biometric systems can be expensive due to the amount of sensors and processing resources involved. Efforts have been made to integrate these systems to vehicles mostly for security purposes and user authentication. Until now, most of the systems do not go beyond using facial and fingerprint data to start the engine or access the car; however, new generations demand more personalization plus the vehicle making decisions based on their physiological characteristics. Although this kind of technology is considered a luxury feature in general, actually it could help users and save their lives. Indeed, biometry is the way to make the human-vehicle relationship happen, whether the biometric devices are embedded inside the vehicle, used as an accessory or wearables. By using as input not only the sensors inside the vehicle but also data from outside, the vehicle could adapt and/or learn new information to make the best possible decision.

                  In this paper, a novel plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) modeling approach is proposed for residential charging stations. This methodology can be used in the design of autonomous energy management systems (EMS) with the purpose of providing the charging schedules using minimum input measured data. The proposed method is composed of two main steps. In the first step, unlike other similar works, online PEV recognition is performed by means of an artificial neural network as a supervised classification method. The required feature space for classification is provided using the power spectral density estimation and the statistical analysis of individual PEVs charging current. The second step deals with the statistical modeling of the charging habits to facilitate the scheduling by predicting the charging demand using the current measurements on the grid side. In this respect, each PEV charging habit is modeled based on the correlation among the plug-in time, departure time, required energy, and weekdays using kernel density estimation. The performance of the suggested method is validated using real data collected from a charging station. The final results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology with a satisfactory precision. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a comparative analysis in terms of the recognition performance.

A main difference from traditional learning is that deep learning learns the representations of the data, i.e., the features, via greedy layer-wise pre-training. The characteristics of deep learning promotes it as a power tool to mine the data from Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The paper focuses on the economic aspect of IoV and investigates deep learning enabled IoV market for data trading and processing. The economic model of IoV consists of three side: the data provider, the service provider, and the user. The data provider collects the data for the user. The user buys the raw data. The data is further processed by the service provider, who provides the learned features for the user to obtain some profit. To optimize the profit of three-sided participators, a Stackelberg game is proposed to model the interactions among them. We derive the equilibrium pricing mechanism of the providers and corresponding demands of the users. The existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium strategies are proved. Our analysis reveals that the strategy of each participator is related to the utility of the user and the data/service provider’s cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the data provider and the service provider directly interact with the user in the data market.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.

                  This study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated underwater vehicle subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the five degrees freedom dynamic model of an underactuated AUV is constructed, and the trajectory tracking error dynamic model is established. Secondly, a nonlinear robust control scheme is presented based on the command filtered backstepping method, which not only greatly reduces the computational complexities in the traditional backstepping approach, but also filters out the high frequency measurement noise in the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the neural networks and adaptive control techniques are employed to estimate and compensate the effect of parameter uncertainties in the control system. Thirdly, in order to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control vaules and the filtered signals, a Lyapunov-based filtered error compensation loop is designed, and an anti-windup design is also developed to deal with the problem of integral saturation in control input signals. After that, the stability of the control scheme proposed in this paper is proved in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed tracking controller.
