Chapter,doi:10.1007/978-3-030-75123-4_10,IoT-Based Pervasive Sentiment Analysis: A Fine-Grained Text Normalization Framework for Context Aware Hybrid Applications,Information and Knowledge in Internet of Things,10.1007/978-3-030-75123-4_10,Springer,2022-01-01,2021-10-07,"The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates physical objects in a networked real-world environment utilizing sensor-based software technologies in order to connect, share and exchange data with other relevant devices or platforms over the Internet. The contemporary business intelligence solutions encourage the IoT industry to reap benefits of big data dependent pervasive semantic orientation of public moods and relevant information shared in textual form using context aware integrated information management, by means of opinion mining through social media-based pervasive hybrid applications. Opinion mining (OM), also referred as pervasive sentiment analysis, is a process of extracting user orientation regarding products, services, businesses and other entities. It aims to classify an opinionative clue into positive or negative based on the sense and semantic category, which remains hidden from the human eye and non-pervasive applications. The microblog and social media-based information is intrinsically hybrid in nature, which may comprise an ample amount of ubiquitous noise. The public opinions can be classified through supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised classifiers. Effective sentiment analysis is common to use in data science research, but unfortunately microblogging services like Twitter allows short text for communication, which compels online publishers to post unstructured and short form of opinions towards the target entities. Unstructured and short form of tweets makes it difficult to extract meaningful and accurate sentiment orientation. This limitation can be tackled through an effective preprocessing of text. Text normalization or preprocessing is the process of removing undesired symbols, tags and conversion of unstructured data into valuable information in order to make quality input for efficient sentiment analysis. It is observed that existing preprocessors and text normalizers ignored the informal nature of text especially slangs and subject tags due to scarcity of linguistic resources, which sometimes affects the sentiment accuracy. Therefore, this research proposes a framework for effective preprocessing of text in order to generate quality input. The proposed framework for an effective text preprocessing involves the following: (i). Extraction of text (ii). Removal of undesired tags (iii). Stop word removal (iv). Definition of slang terms (v). Stemming and lemmatization (vi). Part-of-speech tagging (vii). Coreference resolution (viii). Tag identification Informal text (a.k.a. slang) and tag identification are the major contributions of proposed framework. Slangs and Tags play a significant role in the semantic orientation of sentiments and emotions. The performance of proposed framework is evaluated over Twitter dataset using Python natural language toolkit. Experimental setup revealed that the proposed system achieved promising results with an average F1-Measure of 71% and accuracy of 72.4%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-75123-4_10,springer

They should be tackled in a fast, precise, and with an early detection goal. In recent years, social media has become popular, turning its users into proper “citizen sensors,” which means a person who, through devices, records incidents on these platforms. Therefore, they become real-time communicators of emergency events. This paper presents a preliminary study based on supervised learning toward social media emergency events detection. This approach has four phases: the first two correspond to data acquisition and preprocessing, where tweets available in a public repository about emergency and non-emergency were taken, filtered, and converted through a process of lemma feature extraction. In the third phase, four most commonly used supervised algorithms were implemented to detect tweets containing emergency events. Finally, using validation metrics and algorithms to detect emergency and non-emergency reported in the tweets was verified. Computational results showed that all evaluated algorithms achieved average rates of 85.38% of accuracy meanwhile that in execution time about 23 seconds, to detect a real emergency event. The best algorithm when trade-offs between execution time and emergency detection capability are considered was the SVM.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-4126-8_25,springer

In agri-food industrial systems, an artificial intelligent system would drive a system towards the set objectives based on the information and knowledge gathered from the consumers, farmers, machines, and domain experts. Machine learning (ML) is the preferred tool to process the knowledge and information for identifying some underlying rules and patterns to support the implementation of the AI based solution. ML-based AI is preferred, because the heterogeneity in consumer preference, biological variability of material characteristics, and unpredictable system behavior presents a highly complex system to be handled by the rule based expert systems. This chapter gives an insight of the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning with the emphasis on their application for AI implementation in the field of agri-food material handling. Popular ML algorithms viz., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are discussed as feature description methods for classification and recognition, based on the product images.

In such critical situation, it becomes imperative to take data driven decisions. User generated content over online social media is an untapped data source that can be leveraged to gain insights for effective governance and decision making; and can also serve as a first hand communication medium between the various government bodies and citizens. In this paper, we have proposed a novel governance framework that leverages user generated content on social media for effective decision making by the authorities. We have used topic modelling techniques to discover social-economic trends, and to understand the issues or concerns of public interest. We used information extraction techniques like noun and verb phrase extraction, and Named Entity Recognition to measure the geographical spread, identify Covid-19 hotspots, assist in contact tracing, and discovering new health conditions. From the available literature, we could not find any intelligent framework for effective governance during pandemics, where user generated content has been utilized for real time decision making. In this paper, we address this real world problem through our proposed decision support System, and demonstrate as a proof-of-concept of how it can be used for effective governance during the pandemics through its prototype implementation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3346-1_35,springer

It is a crowdsourcing platform, capable of complementing and supplementing remote sensing data in disaster mapping. Continuous monitoring of disasters such as floods from pre-stage to post stage is essential and geo-social media can attain it. The present research proposes a robust architecture to develop a social media-based near-real time flood monitoring system. In addition, our research article also emphasizes the efficient methods to process, analyse and explore multiple data dimensions of social media. A prototype model was prepared and tested on the tweets of Chennai floods 2015 to demonstrate social media potential in disaster monitoring. We implemented Natural Language Processing and Supervised Machine Learning in data processing and analysis segments of the framework by assembling various open source python libraries to develop the prototype. Initially, we built the required tweet corpus and performed pre-processing steps on it. Later, the collected tweets were geocoded with the place names available in the tweets and classified them into various flood topic related classes using Naive Bayes classifier. Subsequently, the tweets showcasing the flood condition were determined to generate a point map and a point density map to identify the flood hotspots. We verified our results with openly available 2015 Chennai flood map that is generated using remote sensing images and found positive outcome. A prototype web portal was developed to publish the results from above model as web maps. Furthermore, the portal would prove to be useful as a source for disseminating information to the public. The results prove that the proposed framework is evidently supportive in establishing a near real time monitoring system during emergencies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12524-021-01376-9,springer

We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms.

To compensate for this, some governments show an interest in teaching it from an early age. It appears that educational resources related to AI literacy in schools are most often focused on technical skills. However, the challenges of such education are also ethical and societal, requiring an interdisciplinary and critical approach. This research aims at developing a 10–14 years old curriculum questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and crossing computer science education and media literacy education. Through a role-playing game, the children discover the basic concepts of machine learning. Beyond their initial representations, which they become aware that they are largely fueled by the media, they can realize that an AI system is the result of design choices and that it only works within the framework that has been defined for it. Moreover, the possibility for teachers to teach the curriculum themselves in their classes is also evaluated. To this end, the curriculum was taught to 60 future trainee teachers, 70 middle school pupils, and 12 elementary pupils. Interviews were conducted also with 5 teachers who had either observed the curriculum taught by a researcher or attempted to teach it themselves. The results show that the children’s representations have evolved towards representations that are more technically correct (although incomplete), but not very oriented towards aspects that open up critical questioning. The difficulties revealed in the implementation of the critical part are due in particular to the complexity of the IT concepts to be addressed, but also to the lack of teacher training. However, the data collected seems to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address certain aspects of AI. In conclusion, in addition to the curriculum, this paper describes a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education and media literacy education, and gives avenues for other designers and researchers to create AI critical educational experiences for K-12 learners.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13218-021-00733-7,springer

Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot’s request for service feedback.

Materials and methods Using Twitter search features, all tweets containing keywords from both “radiology” and “COVID-19” were collected for the period January 01, 2020 up to April 24, 2020. The resulting dataset comprised of 8354 tweets. Images were classified as (i) images with text (ii) radiological content (e.g., CT scan snapshots, X-ray images), and (iii) non-medical content like personal images or memes. We trained our deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on training dataset of 1040 labeled images drawn from all three classes. We then trained another DL classifier for segmenting images into categories based on human anatomy. All software used is open-source and adapted for this research. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing results on a test set of 1885 images. Results Our analysis shows that in COVID-19 related tweets on radiology, nearly 32% had textual images, another 24% had radiological content, and 44% were not of radiological significance. Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text. With larger training dataset and algorithmic tweaks, the accuracy can be further improved. Conclusion Applying DL on rich textual images and other metadata in tweets we can process and classify content for radiological significance in real time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10140-020-01885-z,springer

Hence, analyzing legal contents is a challenging task, and the legal domain is increasingly looking for automatic-processing support. This paper focuses on a specific context in the legal domain, which has so far remained unexplored: automatic processing of garnishment documents. A garnishment is a legal procedure by which a creditor can collect what a debtor owes by requiring to confiscate a debtor’s property (e.g., a checking account) that is hold by a third party, dubbed garnishee. Our proposal, motivated by a real-world use case, is a versatile natural-language-processing pipeline to support a garnishee in the processing of a large-scale flow of garnishment documents. In particular, we mainly focus on two tasks: (i) categorize received garnishment notices onto a predefined taxonomy of categories; (ii) perform an information-extraction phase, which consists in automatically identifying from the text various information, such as identity of involved actors, amounts, and dates. The main contribution of this work is to describe challenges, design, implementation, and performance of the core modules and methods behind our solution.

Hence, the identification of genes with the underlying circadian rhythmic features is pivotal. Though computational methods have been developed for the identification of circadian genes, all these methods are based on gene expression datasets. In other words, we failed to search any sequence-based model, and that motivated us to deploy the present computational method to identify the proteins encoded by the circadian genes. Results Support vector machine (SVM) with seven kernels, i.e., linear, polynomial, radial, sigmoid, hyperbolic, Bessel and Laplace was utilized for prediction by employing compositional, transitional and physico-chemical features. Higher accuracy of 62.48% was achieved with the Laplace kernel, following the fivefold cross- validation approach. The developed model further secured 62.96% accuracy with an independent dataset. The SVM also outperformed other state-of-art machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost, XGBoost and LASSO. We also performed proteome-wide identification of circadian proteins in two cereal crops namely, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor , followed by the functional annotation of the predicted circadian proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational method to identify the circadian genes with the sequence data.

In this paper, we present an activity recognition approach for activities of daily living based on deep learning and skeleton data. In the literature, ad hoc features extraction/selection algorithms with supervised classification methods have been deployed, reaching an excellent classification performance. Here, we propose a deep learning approach, combining CNN and LSTM, that exploits both the learning of spatial dependencies correlating the limbs in a skeleton 3D grid representation and the learning of temporal dependencies from instances with a periodic pattern that works on raw data and so without requiring an explicit feature extraction process. These models are proposed for real-time activity recognition, and they are tested on the CAD-60 dataset. Results show that the proposed model behaves better than an LSTM model thanks to the automatic features extraction of the limbs’ correlation. “New Person” results show that the CNN-LSTM model achieves $$95.4\%$$ 95.4 % of precision and $$94.4\%$$ 94.4 % of recall, while the “Have Seen” results are $$96.1\%$$ 96.1 % of precision and $$94.7\%$$ 94.7 % of recall.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11370-021-00358-7,springer

Together, mathematical models of negotiation can often be implemented in autonomous processes, referred to as negotiation agents, that can incorporate realistic negotiation factors and engage in negotiations in a decentralized manner.

For example, anti-drug police rely on social data to identify hidden drug abusers. However, in the deployment of GNNs, it still require interpretability techniques to support. Because GNNs embed the node information and pass them through the adjacency network, resulting in the lack of transparency in its model. However, the common explanation technique used in other models are not directly applicable on GNNs. And those explanation methods in CNNs are not applicable either considering the topological variety of graph.

This process often leads to the construction of a real-time, collaborative, and intelligent virtual factory of their physical factory (so-called digital twin). The application of digital twins and frontier technologies in production planning still faces many challenges. But the research is still limited about how these frontier technologies can be applied to enhance production planning. This paper introduces how to enhance material resource planning (MRP) with digital twins and other frontier technologies, and presents a framework for the integration of MRP software with digital twin technologies. Indeed, the data collected from the shop floor can improve the accuracy of the optimization models used in the MRP software. First, several MRP parameters are unknown when planning, and some of these parameters may be accurately forecasted from the data with machine learning. Nevertheless, the forecast will never be perfect, and the variability of some parameters may have a critical impact on the resulting plan. Therefore, the optimization approach must properly account for these uncertainties, and some methods must allow building probability distribution from the data. Second, as the optimization models in MRP are based on aggregated data, the resulting plans are usually not implementable in practice. The capacity constraints may be acquired by communication with an accurate simulation of the execution of the plan on the shop floor.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-85874-2_34,springer

It is considered as a convenient platform for users to share personal messages, pictures, and videos. However, while people enjoy social networks, many deceptive activities such as fake news or rumors can mislead users into believing misinformation. Besides, spreading the massive amount of misinformation in social networks has become a global risk. Therefore, misinformation detection (MID) in social networks has gained a great deal of attention and is considered an emerging area of research interest. We find that several studies related to MID have been studied to new research problems and techniques. While important, however, the automated detection of misinformation is difficult to accomplish as it requires the advanced model to understand how related or unrelated the reported information is when compared to real information. The existing studies have mainly focused on three broad categories of misinformation: false information, fake news, and rumor detection. Therefore, related to the previous issues, we present a comprehensive survey of automated misinformation detection on (i) false information, (ii) rumors, (iii) spam, (iv) fake news, and (v) disinformation. We provide a state-of-the-art review on MID where deep learning (DL) is used to automatically process data and create patterns to make decisions not only to extract global features but also to achieve better results.

To achieve this goal, we used different popular Machine Learning tools. Moreover, we integrated an easy-to-use cloud platform, called DSaaS ( Data Science as a Service ), well suited for hospital structures, where healthcare operators might not have specific competences in using programming languages but still, they do need to analyze data as a continuous process. Moreover, DSaaS allows the validation of data analysis models based on supervised Machine Learning regression and classification algorithms. Results We used DSaaS on a real antibiotic stewardship dataset to make predictions about antibiotic resistance in the Clinical Pathology Operative Unit of the Principe di Piemonte Hospital in Senigallia, Marche, Italy. Data related to a total of 1486 hospitalized patients with nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI). Sex, age, age class, ward and time period, were used to predict the onset of a MDR UTI. Machine Learning methods such as Catboost, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks were utilized to build predictive models. Among the performance evaluators, already implemented in DSaaS, we used accuracy (ACC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), area under Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PRC), F1 score, sensitivity (SEN), specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Catboost exhibited the best predictive results (MCC 0.909; SEN 0.904; F1 score 0.809; AUC-PRC 0.853, AUC-ROC 0.739; ACC 0.717) with the highest value in every metric. Conclusions the predictive model built with DSaaS may serve as a useful support tool for physicians treating hospitalized patients with a high risk to acquire MDR UTIs. We obtained these results using only five easy and fast predictors accessible for each patient hospitalization. In future, DSaaS will be enriched with more features like unsupervised Machine Learning techniques, streaming data analysis, distributed calculation and big data storage and management to allow researchers to perform a complete data analysis pipeline.

However, the online microblog text stream is unstructured and unbalanced obviously. Given the big, real-time, and noisy flood disaster microblog text flow, a new regional emergency situation awareness model to automatic assess flood disaster risk is proposed. Firstly, according to the established online disaster event-meta frame, a multi-label classification algorithm for the flood microbloggings is constructed based on the historical dataset. This algorithm helps to assign the relevant event-meta tags to each situation microbloggings. Second, a new machine learning method for dynamic assessment of flood risk for online microbloggings is developed. The flood event-metas are considered to be feature vectors, and the four different levels of flood risk are considered to be four classes. Then, the flood risk assessment task is innovatively transformed into a multi-classification task. By the logistic regression ordered multi-classification algorithm, the dynamic quantitative evaluation of event-meta, users and regional risks is realized. Finally, the proposed model is applied in the case of the Yuyao Flood. The results of the case study show that the Yuyao Flood’s online quantitative risk assessment results are consistent with real accumulated precipitation data, which illustrate that the proposed machine learning model could realize the bottom-up automatic disaster information collecting by processing victim user-generated content effectively. Social media is proven to supplement the deficiencies of traditional disaster statistics and provide real-time, scientific information support for the implementation of flood emergency processes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-020-05487-1,springer

Recent Findings ML approaches have been used to identify potential candidates for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in healthcare settings in the USA and Denmark and in a population-based research setting in Eastern Africa. Although still in the proof-of-concept stage, other applications include ML with smartphone-collected and social media data to promote real-time HIV risk reduction, virtual reality tools to facilitate HIV serodisclosure, and chatbots for HIV education. ML has also been used for causal inference in HIV prevention studies. Summary ML has strong potential to improve delivery of PrEP, with this approach moving from development to implementation. Development and evaluation of AI and ML strategies for HIV prevention may benefit from an implementation science approach, including qualitative assessments with end users, and should be developed and evaluated with attention to equity.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11904-020-00490-6,springer

Here, we report the development and implementation of a deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithm in an autonomous robotic system to search for two-dimensional (2D) materials. We trained the neural network based on Mask-RCNN on annotated optical microscope images of 2D materials (graphene, hBN, MoS_2, and WTe_2). The inference algorithm is run on a 1024 × 1024 px^2 optical microscope images for 200 ms, enabling the real-time detection of 2D materials. The detection process is robust against changes in the microscopy conditions, such as illumination and color balance, which obviates the parameter-tuning process required for conventional rule-based detection algorithms. Integrating the algorithm with a motorized optical microscope enables the automated searching and cataloging of 2D materials. This development will allow researchers to utilize a large number of 2D materials simply by exfoliating and running the automated searching process.

In particular, it aims to find k seeds (users) in social network G , such that the seeds can maximize the influence on users under the specific query topics and diffusion model such as independent cascade (IC) or linear threshold (LT). This problem has been proved to be NP-hard, and most of the proposed techniques suffer from the efficiency issue due to the lack of generalization. Even worse, the design of these algorithms requires significant specialized knowledge which is hard to be understood and implemented. To overcome these issues, this paper aims to learn a generalized heuristic framework to solve TIM problems by meta-learning. To this end, we first propose two topic-aware social influence propagation models based on IC and LT model, respectively, which is conducive to better advertising injections. We then encode the feature of each node by a vector and introduce a model, called deep influence evaluation model , to evaluate the user influence under different circumstances. Based on this model, we can construct the solution according to the influence evaluations efficiently, rather than spending a high cost to compute the exact influence by considering the complex graph structure.

New educational technologies offer vehicles for systematically exploring benefits of alternative techniques for supporting active learning. We introduce a new genre of Intelligent Science Station technology that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support children in learning science by doing science in the real world. We use this system in a randomized controlled trial that investigates whether active learning is best when it is implemented as guided deliberate practice, as constructive “hands-on” activity, or as a combination of both. Automated, reactive guidance is made possible by a specialized AI computer vision algorithm we developed to track what children are doing in the physical environment as they do experiments and discoveries with physical objects. The results support deliberate practice and indicate that having some guided discovery based on effective learning mechanism such as self-explanation, contrasting cases and personalized interactive feedback produces more robust learning compared to exploratory construction alone. Children learning through guided discovery achieve greater understanding of the scientific principles than children learning through hands-on construction alone (4 times more pre-to-post test improvement). Importantly, a combined guided discovery and hands-on construction condition leads to better learning of the very hands-on construction skills that are the sole focus of the hands-on constructive learning condition (>10 times more pre-to-post improvement). These results suggest ways to achieve powerful active learning of science and engineering that go beyond the widespread temptation to equate hands-on activity with effective learning.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40593-020-00194-3,springer

However, at the same time, this has resulted in the emergence of conflict and hate, making online environments uninviting for users. Although researchers have found that hate is a problem across multiple platforms, there is a lack of models for online hate detection using multi-platform data. To address this research gap, we collect a total of 197,566 comments from four platforms: YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia, and Twitter, with 80% of the comments labeled as non-hateful and the remaining 20% labeled as hateful. We then experiment with several classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) and feature representations (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, and their combination). While all the models significantly outperform the keyword-based baseline classifier, XGBoost using all features performs the best (F1 = 0.92). Feature importance analysis indicates that BERT features are the most impactful for the predictions. Findings support the generalizability of the best model, as the platform-specific results from Twitter and Wikipedia are comparable to their respective source papers.

However, when training an ML algorithm, obtaining large sets of micro-level human behaviour data is often problematic. Information on human behaviour is often collected via surveys of relatively small sample sizes. This paper presents a methodology for training a learning algorithm to guide agent behaviour in a spatial ABM using a limited survey data sample. We apply different implementation strategies using survey data and Bayesian networks (BNs). By being grounded in probabilistic directed graphical models, BNs stand out among other learning algorithms in that they can be based on expert knowledge and/or known datasets. This paper presents four alternative implementations of data-driven BNs to support agent decisions in a spatial ABM. We differentiate between training BNs prior to, or during the simulation runs, using only survey data or a combination of survey data and expert knowledge. The four different implementations are then illustrated using a spatial ABM of cholera diffusion for Kumasi, Ghana.

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations. Compounding this problem, banks regard their trade data required for a full analysis as proprietary. We adapt a simulation technology combining advances in graph theory to randomly generate entire financial systems sampled from realistic distributions with a novel open-source risk engine to compute risks in financial systems under different regulations. This allows us to consistently evaluate, predict, and optimize the impact of financial regulations on all levels—from a single trade to systemic risk—before it is implemented. The resulting data set is accessible to contemporary data science techniques like data mining, anomaly detection, and visualization. We find that collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system in crisis, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-11286-8_8,springer

Vulnerabilities that are known only by attackers but not by software vendors and neither by users have severe impact on security of systems and networks. Such vulnerabilities are exploited to intrude systems and often cause leakage of confidential data. Due to the hitherto unknown pattern of the exploitation, real-time detection is hardly possible. Hence, often an incident is detected only long time after it took place, if it is detected at all. More timely detection of attacks is necessary to trigger suitable counter-measures like reconfiguration of firewalls and sending alerts to administrators of other vulnerable targets. Therefore, to know the attributes of a novel attack’s target system supports the protection of other vulnerable systems. We suggest a novel approach of post-incident intrusion detection system, to be precise—a crowd-based intrusion detection system. To accomplish this, we take advantage of social media users’ postings about incidents that affect their user accounts of attacked target systems or their observations about misbehaving online services. Combining knowledge of the attacked systems and reported incidents, we should be able to recognize patterns that define the attributes of vulnerable systems. Furthermore, by matching detected attribute sets with those attributes of well-known attacks, we should be able to link attacks to already existing entries in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. If a link to an existing entry is not found, we can assume to have detected an exploitation of an unknown vulnerability, i.e., a zero day exploit or the result of an advanced persistent threat. This finding could also be used to direct efforts of examining vulnerabilities of attacked systems and simultaneously lead to faster patch deployment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-27400-3_36,springer

These socialbots have widespread usage in political campaigning and product marketing, but SocialBots can also been used for the purpose of swaying voters, mounting political attacks, manipulating public opinion, etc. Apart from these, SocialBots posses various security risks, one of which is befriending an OSN user thereby gaining access to personal details such as birthday, email id, phone number, address, etc. Detection of these SocialBots is therefore an important problem to be solved in order to maintain the reputation of OSN. Our work concentrates on behavioral analysis of these SocialBots in the OSN and identifying features to be used to develop a model for detection of these Socialbots using machine learning.

Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot’s needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments.

Theory and Algorithms,10.1007/978-3-642-17537-4_81,Springer,2010-01-01,,"With the rapid growth of the Internet, more and more people interact with their friends in online social networks like Facebook. Currently, the privacy issue of online social networks becomes a hot and dynamic research topic. Though some privacy protecting strategies are implemented, they are not stringent enough. Recently, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), which has the advantage of utilizing the unlabeled data to achieve better performance, attracts much attention from the web research community. By utilizing a large number of unlabeled data from websites, SSL can effectively infer hidden or sensitive information on the Internet. Furthermore, graph-based SSL is much more suitable for modeling real-world objects with graph characteristics, like online social networks. Thus, we propose a novel Community-based Graph (CG) SSL model that can be applied to exploit security issues in online social networks, then provide two consistent algorithms satisfying distinct needs. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this model, we conduct a series of experiments on a synthetic data and two real-world data from StudiVZ and Facebook. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can more accurately and confidently predict sensitive information of online users, comparing to previous models.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-17537-4_81,springer

Neural networks,Journal of Materials Research,10.1557/jmr.2006.0076,Springer,2006-03-01,2006-03-01,"In this paper, a new method for the identification of material parameters is presented. Neural networks, which are trained on the basis of finite element simulations, are used to solve the inverse problem. The material parameters to be identified are part of a viscoplasticity model that has been formulated for finite deformations and implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. A proper multi-creep loading history was developed in a previous paper using a phenomenological model for viscoplastic spherical indentation. Now, this phenomenological model is replaced by a more realistic finite element model, which provides fast computation and numerical solutions of high accuracy at the same time. As a consequence, existing neural networks developed for the phenomenological model have been extended from a power law hardening with two material parameters to an Armstrong-Frederick hardening rule with three parameters. These are the yield stress, the initial slope of work hardening, and maximum hardening stress of the equilibrium response. In addition, elastic deformation is taken into account. The viscous part is based on a Chaboche-like overstress model, consisting of two material parameters determining velocity dependence and overstress as a function of the strain rate. The method has been verified by additional finite element simulations. Its application for various metals will be presented in Part II, [ J. Mater. Res. 21 , 677 (2006)].",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1557/jmr.2006.0076,springer

The leading application consists in the analysis of ductile cast iron specimen pictures, in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the graphite nodules shape; to this aim the material specimen pictures are binarized. Such a binarization process can be formulated as an optimal segmentation problem. The search for the optimal solution is solved efficiently by training a neural network on a suitable set of binary templates. A robust procedure is obtained, amenable for parallel or hardware implementation, so that real-time applications can be effectively dealt with. The method was developed as the core of an expert system aimed at the unsupervised analysis of ductile cast iron mechanical properties that are influenced by the microstructure and the peculiar morphology of graphite elements.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10044-006-0052-8,springer

In particular, I argue that standard notions of computation together with a ‘state-to-state correspondence view of implementation’ cannot overcome difficulties posed by Putnam's Realization Theorem and that, therefore, a different approach to implementation is required. The notion ‘realization of a function’, developed out of physical theories, is then introduced as a replacement for the notional pair ‘computation-implementation’. After gradual refinement, taking practical constraints into account, this notion gives rise to the notion ‘digital system’ which singles out physical systems that could be actually used, and possibly even built.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008364332419,springer

Understood astargeting AI proper – claims that computers can think or do think– Searle's argument, despite its rhetorical flash, is logically andscientifically a dud. Advertised as effective against AI proper, theargument, in its main outlines, is an ignoratio elenchi. It musterspersuasive force fallaciously by indirection fostered by equivocaldeployment of the phrase ""strong AI"" and reinforced by equivocation on thephrase ""causal powers"" (at least) equal to those of brains."" On a morecarefully crafted understanding – understood just to targetmetaphysical identification of thought with computation (""Functionalism""or ""Computationalism"") and not AI proper the argument is still unsound,though more interestingly so. It's unsound in ways difficult for high church– ""someday my prince of an AI program will come"" – believersin AI to acknowledge without undermining their high church beliefs. The adhominem bite of Searle's argument against the high church persuasions of somany cognitive scientists, I suggest, largely explains the undeserved reputethis really quite disreputable argument enjoys among them.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008255830248,springer
