Such adherence failure can impact therapeutic efficacy for the patients in question and compromises data quality around the population-level efficacy of the drug for the indications targeted. In this study, we applied various ensemble learning and deep learning models to predict medication adherence among patients. Our contribution to this endeavour involves targeting the problem of adherence prediction for a particularly challenging class of patients who self-administer injectable medication at home. Our prediction pipeline, based on event history, comprises a connected sharps bin which aims to help patients better manage their condition and improve outcomes. In other words, the efficiency of interventions can be significantly improved by prioritizing the patients who are most likely to be non-adherent. The collected data comprising a rich event feature set may be exploited for the purposes of predicting the status of the next adherence state for individual patients. This paper reports on how this concept can be realized through an investigation using a wide range of ensemble learning and deep learning models on a real-world dataset collected from such a system. The dataset investigated comprises 342,174 historic injection disposal records collected over the course of more than 5 years. A comprehensive comparison of different models is given in this paper. Moreover, we demonstrate that the selected best performer, long short-term memory (LSTM), generalizes well by deploying it in a true future testing dataset.

New AI technologies based on machine learning approaches should play a key role in clinical decision-making in the future. However, their implementation in health care settings remains limited, mostly due to a lack of robust validation procedures. There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular -omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods The European “ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)” consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the “ITFoC Challenge”. This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets. Conclusions The predictive performance and safety of AI technologies must be assessed in a robust, unbiased and transparent manner before their implementation in healthcare settings. We believe that the consideration of the ITFoC consortium will contribute to the safe transfer and implementation of AI in clinical settings, in the context of precision oncology and personalized care.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12911-021-01634-3,springer

Methods We reviewed patients undergoing pyeloplasty from 2008 to 2020 at our institution, including all children and adolescents younger than 18 years. We developed a two-stage machine learning model from 34 clinical fields, which included patient characteristics, ultrasound findings, and anatomical variation. We fit and trained with a logistic lasso model for binary cure model and subsequent survival model. Feature importance on the model was determined with post-selection inference. Performance metrics included area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC), concordance, and leave-one-out cross validation. Results A total of 543 patients were identified, with a median preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior diameter of 23 and 10 mm, respectively. 39 of 232 patients included in the survival model required re-intervention. The cure and survival models performed well with a leave-one-out cross validation AUROC and concordance of 0.86 and 0.78, respectively. Post-selective inference showed that larger anteroposterior diameter at the second post-op follow-up, and anatomical variation in the form of concurrent anomalies were significant model features predicting negative outcomes. The model can be used at https://sickkidsurology.shinyapps.io/PyeloplastyReOpRisk/ . Conclusion Our ML-based model performed well in predicting the risk of and time to re-intervention after pyeloplasty. The implementation of this ML-based approach is novel in pediatric urology and will likely help achieve personalized risk stratification for patients undergoing pyeloplasty.

The work introduced in the paper provides an interface in mobile platform, which enables the user to input histopathology image and obtain the prediction results with its class probability through embedded web-server. The trained deep convolutional neural networks model is deployed into a microcomputer-based embedded system after hyper-parameter tuning, offering congruent performance. The implementation results show that the embedded platform with custom-trained CNN model is suitable for medical image classification, as it takes less execution time and mean prediction time.

Some existing work has suggested that AI may replace clinicians. We argue to the contrary, that the clinician will not be replaced, nor their role attenuated. Rather, they will be integral to the responsible design, deployment, and regulation of AI in healthcare, acting as the moral exemplar for the virtuous machine. We collate relevant points from the literature and formulate our own to present a coherent argument for the central role of clinicians in ethical AI and propose ideas to help advance efforts to employ ML-based solutions within healthcare.

Health telemonitoring is an innovative solution allowing wellbeing and increasing autonomy of patients. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are a viable method used in recent studies for analyzing, predicting, and classifying health data while improving the health conditions of telemonitoring and telediagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely. The first layer of the proposed architecture performs BP measurement, classification, and transmission to the second layer using a wearable sensor. The learning of classifiers is established with Cross-Validation to avoid over-fitting and to improve the performance while comparing the Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier. An experimental trial is carried out and the timing of 49 seconds is reached between BP measurement and the display of data on the IoT platform. Besides, the system was tested in real-time trials and produced an accurate classification of each measured BP. The obtained results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of BP measurement, analysis, transmission, and supervision in real-time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12652-020-02660-1,springer

A total of 28 participants (11.9%) were referred for follow-up based on new ocular findings, among whom, 15 (53.6%) were able to be contacted and 9 (60%) adhered to referral. Of 207 participants who completed a satisfaction questionnaire, 93.7% specified they were either satisfied or extremely satisfied, and 93.2% specified they would be likely or extremely likely to use this service again. Clinical staff involved in screening most frequently noted that the AI system was easy to use, and the real-time diagnostic report was useful. Our study indicates that AI-assisted DR screening model is accurate and well-accepted by patients and clinicians in endocrinology and indigenous healthcare settings. Future deployments of AI-assisted screening models would require consideration of downstream referral pathways.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94178-5,springer

We developed Niffler, an open-source Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) framework that enables ML and processing pipelines in research clusters by efficiently retrieving images from the hospitals’ PACS and extracting the metadata from the images. We deployed Niffler at our institution (Emory Healthcare, the largest healthcare network in the state of Georgia) and retrieved data from 715 scanners spanning 12 sites, up to 350 GB/day continuously in real-time as a DICOM data stream over the past 2 years. We also used Niffler to retrieve images bulk on-demand based on user-provided filters to facilitate several research projects. This paper presents the architecture and three such use cases of Niffler. First, we executed an IVC filter detection and segmentation pipeline on abdominal radiographs in real-time, which was able to classify 989 test images with an accuracy of 96.0%. Second, we applied the Niffler Metadata Extractor to understand the operational efficiency of individual MRI systems based on calculated metrics. We benchmarked the accuracy of the calculated exam time windows by comparing Niffler against the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW). Niffler accurately identified the scanners’ examination timeframes and idling times, whereas CDW falsely depicted several exam overlaps due to human errors. Third, with metadata extracted from the images by Niffler, we identified scanners with misconfigured time and reconfigured five scanners. Our evaluations highlight how Niffler enables real-time ML and processing pipelines in a research cluster.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10278-021-00491-w,springer

The purpose of this publication is to analyse risks and threats relating to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) considerations in the context of scientific and technological development. The article attempts the analysis of whether current legislation of the European Union enables good protection of workers’ health in the performance of their duties using robots, artificial intelligence (AI). A feature of robotisation and AI may be new challenges in OHS protection. The analysis performed aims to determine whether threats posted by working with Artificial Intelligence are serious enough for the EU Legislator to focus on implementation of new OHS regulations. Methods The analysis was carried out on the basis of current legal regulations related to the protection of employee’s health in the European Union. The study used literature related to robotisation with artificial intelligence and health and safety at work in the working environment. Results Given the new psychological and physical threats related to the use of AI robots, it is necessary to expand the EU legislation with general guidelines for the use of intelligent robots in the work environment. Indeed, such robots must be defined in the applicable legal framework. Employers should also define, as part of their internal regulations, the procedures for employee communication with artificial intelligence, and relevantly update their training in the OHS area. Conclusions The developments in AI-assisted robots come with inherent risks and threats to the working environment. New challenges create the need for adapting EU laws to changing reality.

This technique has been supporting pathologists in making precise decisions regarding differential diagnosis and subtyping, and in creating personalized treatment plans. However, the interpretation of IHC results presents challenges in complicated cases. Furthermore, rapidly increasing amounts of IHC data are making it even harder for pathologists to reach to definitive conclusions. Methods We developed ImmunoGenius, a machine-learning-based expert system for the pathologist, to support the diagnosis of tumors of unknown origin. Based on Bayesian theorem, the most probable diagnoses can be drawn by calculating the probabilities of the IHC results in each disease. We prepared IHC profile data of 584 antibodies in 2009 neoplasms based on the relevant textbooks. We developed the reactive native mobile application for iOS and Android platform that can provide 10 most possible differential diagnoses based on the IHC input. Results We trained the software using 562 real case data, validated it with 382 case data, tested it with 164 case data and compared the precision hit rate. Precision hit rate was 78.5, 78.0 and 89.0% in training, validation and test dataset respectively. Which showed no significant difference. The main reason for discordant precision was lack of disease-specific IHC markers and overlapping IHC profiles observed in similar diseases. Conclusion The results of this study showed a potential that the machine-learning algorithm based expert system can support the pathologic diagnosis by providing second opinion on IHC interpretation based on IHC database. Incorporation with contextual data including the clinical and histological findings might be required to elaborate the system in the future.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s13000-021-01081-8,springer

The objective of this study was to construct models by implementing machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict BMI classifications (≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2) in administrative healthcare claims databases, and then internally and externally validate them. Methods Five advanced ML algorithms were implemented for each BMI classification on a random sampling of BMI readings from the Optum PanTher Electronic Health Record database (2%) and the Optum Clinformatics Date of Death (20%) database, while incorporating baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Sensitivity analyses with oversampling ratios were conducted. Model performance was validated internally and externally. Results Models trained on the Super Learner ML algorithm (SLA) yielded the best BMI classification predictive performance. SLA model 1 utilized sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including baseline BMI values; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was approximately 88% for the prediction of BMI classifications of ≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2 (internal validation), while accuracy ranged from 87.9% to 92.8% and specificity ranged from 91.8% to 94.7%. SLA model 2 utilized sociodemographic information and clinical characteristics, excluding baseline BMI values; ROC AUC was approximately 73% for the prediction of BMI classifications of ≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2 (internal validation), while accuracy ranged from 73.6% to 80.0% and specificity ranged from 71.6% to 85.9%. The external validation on the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database yielded relatively consistent results with slightly diminished performance.

These algorithms can be used to detect anomalous physiological readings, potentially leading to expedited emergency response or new knowledge about the development of a health condition. However, while there has been much research conducted in assessing the performance of anomaly detection algorithms on well-known public datasets, there is less conceptual comparison across unsupervised and supervised performance on physiological data. Moreover, while heart rate data are both ubiquitous and noninvasive, there has been little research specifically for anomaly detection of this type of data. Considering that heart rate data are indicative of both potential health complications and an individual’s physical activity, this is a rich source of largely overlooked data. To this end, we employed and evaluated five machine learning algorithms, two of which are unsupervised and the remaining three supervised, in their ability to detect anomalies in heart rate data. These algorithms were then evaluated on real heart rate data. Findings supported the effectiveness of local outlier factor and random forests algorithms in the task of heart rate anomaly detection, as each model generalized well from their training on simulated heart rate data to real world heart rate data. Furthermore, results support that simulated data can help configure algorithms to a degree of performance when real labeled data are not available and that this type of learning might be especially helpful in initial deployment of a system without prior data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00146-020-00985-1,springer

Application performance variation leads to premature termination of jobs, decreased energy efficiency, or wasted computing resources. Manual root-cause analysis of performance variation based on system telemetry has become an increasingly time-intensive process as it relies on human experts and the size of telemetry data has grown. Recent methods use supervised machine learning models to automatically diagnose previously encountered performance anomalies in compute nodes. However, supervised machine learning models require large labeled data sets for training. This labeled data requirement is restrictive for many real-world application domains, including HPC systems, because collecting labeled data is challenging and time-consuming, especially considering anomalies that sparsely occur. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised framework that diagnoses previously encountered performance anomalies in HPC systems using a limited number of labeled data points, which is more suitable for production system deployment. Our framework first learns performance anomalies’ characteristics by using historical telemetry data in an unsupervised fashion. In the following process, we leverage supervised classifiers to identify anomaly types. While most semi-supervised approaches do not typically use anomalous samples, our framework takes advantage of a few labeled anomalous samples to classify anomaly types. We evaluate our framework on a production HPC system and on a testbed HPC cluster. We show that our proposed framework achieves 60% F1-score on average, outperforming state-of-the-art supervised methods by 11%, and maintains an average 0.06% anomaly miss rate.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-78713-4_11,springer

As of this writing, COVID-19 has infected around 5,401,222 people around the world with 343,800 fatalities. Since December 2019, the number of infections is increasing exponentially, and several attempts have been made to battle against the virus. The data collected from various resources are used to train the model and deployed on exclusive real-time tasks to help health care works and policy makers. However, we cannot restore human brain with an AI system. Within a short period of time, AI has been applied to a wide range of applications to fight against COVID-19, and in this chapter, we aim to review the recent successes. Lastly, after introducing different applications, we underline the common problems and limitations of the AI systems in COVID-19. In this short communication, we discussed the presence of AI to combat against the novel COVID-19 and its limitations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-33-4412-9_8,springer

This later is made up of a centralized network of intelligent communicating portable electronic devices based on biomedical sensors operating in IoT context in synergy with the wireless sensor network, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence technologies. The purpose of this system is the monitoring, detection, and early diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease in a population settling in a target area (city, region, country, etc.). This is done using an electronic device worn by each person (such as a bracelet or a chest strap). In fact, the designed device collects, in real-time, all the necessary biomedical measurements of a person, including their location, freeing them from any hospitalization or use of complex and expensive equipment. These informations are then transmitted, via a wireless connection, to  the supervision center which takes care of its storage in a specialized database. This center processes the collected data for each person by running a decision-making algorithm using artificial intelligence and a fuzzy inference engine to detect accurately each possible abnormal change in the supervised quantities reflecting risk factors or indicating the appearance of symptoms characterizing COVID-19 disease. In this case, the control system triggers a warning alarm concerning this infected person and requests the intervention of the competent authorities to take the necessary measures and actions. Computer simulations with Matlab software and experimental test prove the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.

In most studies, the training and testing data are assumed to be collected from the same sensor. However, in real practice, due to the mounting limitation and sensor malfunctioning, it cannot be generally guaranteed to obtain the data from the same sensor location at all times. The testing and training data can be possibly from different sensor locations. Consequently, different data distributions exist, which remarkably deteriorates the data-driven model performance in different scenarios. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning-based cross-sensor domain adaptation approach for machinery fault diagnosis. The maximum mean discrepancy is deployed as a distance metric to realize marginal domain fusion. The unlabeled parallel data is further exploited to achieve conditional domain alignment with respect to different machine health conditions. An electro-mechanical actuator dataset is used as a case study for the validation of the proposed method. Different tasks are designed to simulate different cross-sensor domain adaptation problems in fault diagnosis. The experimental results suggest the proposed method achieves higher than $$95\%$$ 95 % testing accuracies in most tasks, and it offers a promising approach for cross-sensor fault diagnosis problems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40435-020-00669-0,springer

However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: −7.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean ± 1.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic. The whole system will continue to be updated based on clinical feedback. It has been demonstrated that this system can provide reliable physiological monitoring for patients in general wards and has the potential to generate more personalized pathophysiological information related to disease diagnosis and treatment from the continuously monitored physiological data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10916-020-01653-z,springer

There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems. Methods A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions. Results Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1–88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0–31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days. Conclusion Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic subpopulations.

Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram (ECG)-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ECG signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave, ST-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods.

However, wireless transmission and deep learning neural network are essential applications and new methods in biomedical engineering nowadays. Hence, authors established a new real-time and intelligent healthcare system that will help the physician’s diagnosis over the patient’s condition and will have a great contribution to medical research. Physiological conditions can be monitored and primary diagnosis will be determined which will help people primarily for personal health care. This paper focused on the collection, transmission, and analysis of physiological signals captured from biosensors with the application of deep learning and segmented analysis for the prediction of heart diseases. Biosensors employed were non-invasive composed of infrared body temperature sensor (MLX90614), heart rate and blood oxygen sensor (MAX30100) and ECG sensor (AD8232). This research used these biosensors to collect signals integrated with Arduino UNO as a central module to process and analyze those signals. ESP8266 Wi-Fi microchip was used to transmit digitized result signals to the database for deep learning analysis. The first segment of deep learning analysis is the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network applied for the temperature, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation prediction. A rolled training technique was used to provide accurate predictions in this segment. The second segment used was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which comprises three hidden layers to analyze the ECG signals from the image datasets. Deep learning tools used were the powerful python language, python based Anaconda, Google’s TensorFlow and open source neural network library Keras. The algorithm was used for evaluation using the available MIT-BIH ECG database from Physionet databases which attained 99.05% accuracy and arrived at only 4.96% loss rate after 30 training steps. The implementation of the system is comprised of physiological parameter sensing system, the wireless transmission system and the deep neural network prediction system. User interfaces were also developed such as the LCD display which shows values of body temperature, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation level. Web page and app were created to allow users or doctors for visual presentations of the results of analysis. The webpage contains information about the system, deep learning networks used, biosensors and the historical graph of about the patient’s body temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation. It also indicates the normal ranges of the physiological parameters.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-30636-6_3,springer

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems enable continuous monitoring of the condition of WTB during operation. When SHM is coupled with advanced data analysis techniques, damage detection can be improved by customizing the methodologies to the structure being monitored. The work presented in this manuscript introduces an SHM methodology based on a Semi-supervised damage detection algorithm that uses preliminary findings to reinforce the selection of features used to identify damage. The methodology proposes a novel technique for feature extraction by sorting the acceleration values in each vibration response. Then, an adaptive feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most sensitive characteristics of the feature for damage detection. This technique enhances the correlation between measurements of the same blade status and therefore the performance of the proposed SHM methodology. The methodology was implemented on real acceleration measurements on an operational Vestas V27 WTB. The results were compared with those from an alternative Semi-supervised methodology that considers only the measurements from the undamaged WTB. The comparison of the results demonstrated that the proposed adaptive feature selection algorithm enhances damage diagnosis.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-8331-1_44,springer

Advances in computational methods have led to implementation of machine learning in multi-modal clinical image analysis. One recent method is online learning where data become available in a sequential order, thus sequentially updating the best predictor for the future data at each step, as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning the entire data set at once. In this chapter, we have examined and analysed multi-modal medical images by developing an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on online variational inference for finite inverted Dirichlet mixture model.

While doing so, pathologists should have all the information needed to make best diagnoses rapidly, while supervising computational pathology tools in real-time. Computational pathology has great potential for augmenting pathologists’ accuracy and efficiency, but concern exists regarding trust for ‘black-box AI’ solutions. Explainable AI (xAI) can reveal underlying reasons for its results, to promote safety, reliability, and accountability for critical tasks such as pathology diagnosis. Built on a hierarchy of computational and traditional image analysis algorithms, we present the development of our proprietary xAI software platform, HistoMapr, for pathologists to improve their efficiency and accuracy when viewing WSIs. HistoMapr and xAI represent a powerful and transparent alternative to ‘black-box’ AI. HistoMapr previews WSIs then presents key diagnostic areas first in an interactive, explainable fashion. Pathologists can access xAI features via a “Why?” button in the interface. Furthermore, two critical early application examples are presented: 1) Intelligent triaging that involves xAI estimation of difficulty for new cases to be forwarded to subspecialists or generalist pathologists; 2) Retrospective quality assurance entails detection of potential discrepancies between finalized results and xAI reviews.

The existing workflow for intraoperative diagnosis based on hematoxylin and eosin staining of processed tissue is time, resource and labor intensive^ 2 , 3 . Moreover, interpretation of intraoperative histologic images is dependent on a contracting, unevenly distributed, pathology workforce^ 4 . In the present study, we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH)^ 5 – 7 , a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically, our CNNs, trained on over 2.5 million SRH images, predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150 s, an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques (for example, 20–30 min)^ 2 . In a multicenter, prospective clinical trial ( n  = 278), we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images (overall accuracy, 94.6% versus 93.9%). Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition, we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images. These results demonstrate how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined, creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory.

Most of the current research on SHM focuses on developing either purely experimental models or stays on purely numerical data without real application validation. The potential of SHM methods however could be unlocked, having accurate enough numerical models and classifiers that not only recognize but also locate or quantify the structural damage. The present study focuses on the implementation of a methodology to bridge the gap between SHM models with numerically generated data and correspondence with measurements from the real structure to provide reliable damage predictions. The methodology is applied in a composite carbon fiber tube truss structure which is constructed, using aluminum elements and steel bolts for the connections. The composite cylindrical parts are produced on a spinning axis by winded carbon fibers, cascaded on specified number of plies, in various angles and directions. 3D FE models of the examined cylindrical parts are developed in robust finite element analysis software simulating each carbon fiber ply and resin matrix and analyzed against static and dynamic loading to investigate their linear and nonlinear response. In addition, experimental tests on composite cylindrical parts are conducted based on the corresponding analysis tests. The potential damage to the structure is set as loose bolts defining a multiclass damage identification problem. The SHM procedure starts with optimal modeling of the structure using an updated Finite Element (FE) model scheme, for the extraction of the most accurate geometrical and physical numerical model. To develop a high-fidelity FE model for reliable damage prediction, modal residuals and mode shapes are combined with response residuals and time-histories of strains and accelerations by using the appropriate updating algorithm. Next, the potential multiclass damage is simulated with the optimal model through a series of stochastic FE load cases for different excitation characteristics. The acceleration time series obtained through a network of optimally placed sensors are defined as the feature vectors of each load case, which are to be fed in a supervised Neural Network (NN) classifier. The necessary data processing, feature learning and limitations of the NN are discussed. Finally, the learned NN is tested against the real structure for different damage cases identification.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-47638-0_16,springer

The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples ( N =683) was randomly split into evaluation ( n =456) and validation ( n =227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. Results The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. Conclusions We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12874-019-0681-4,springer

In this study, we present a novel method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the synthesis of missing precordial leads. The results show that the proposed method receives better similarity and consumes less time using the PTB database. Particularly, the presented method shows outstanding performance in reconstructing the pathological ECG signal, which is crucial for cardiac diagnosis. Our CNN-based method is shown to be more accurate and time-saving for deployment in non-hospital situations to synthesize a standard 12-lead ECG from a reduced lead-set ECG recording.

The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research that has been conducted on automated detection of NMSC using digital images and to assess the quality of evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of these technologies. Methods Eight databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and the ACM Digital Library) were searched to identify diagnostic studies of NMSC using image-based machine learning models. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles. The level of evidence of each study was evaluated using a five tier rating system, and the applicability and risk of bias of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Results Thirty-nine studies were reviewed. Twenty-four models were designed to detect basal cell carcinoma, two were designed to detect squamous cell carcinoma, and thirteen were designed to detect both. All studies were conducted in silico. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the classifiers, defined as concordance with histopathologic diagnosis, was high, with reported accuracies ranging from 72 to 100% and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.832 to 1. Most studies had substantial methodological limitations, but several were robustly designed and presented a high level of evidence. Conclusion Most studies of image-based NMSC classifiers report performance greater than or equal to the reported diagnostic accuracy of the average dermatologist, but relatively few studies have presented a high level of evidence. Clinical studies are needed to assess whether these technologies can feasibly be implemented as a real-time aid for clinical diagnosis of NMSC.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12880-019-0307-7,springer

The medical industry is creating additional services for health- and life-promotion programs. This change represents a medical-service paradigm shift due to the prolonged life expectancy, aging, lifestyle changes, and income increases, and consequently, the concept of the smart health service has emerged as a major issue. Due to smart health, the existing health-promotion medical services that typically have been operated by large hospitals have been developing into remote medical-treatment services where personal health records are used in small hospitals; moreover, a further expansion has been occurring in the direction of u-Healthcare in which health conditions are continuously monitored in the everyday lives of the users. However, as the amount of data is increasing and the medical-data complexity is intensifying, the limitations of the previous approaches are increasingly problematic; furthermore, since even the same disease can show different symptoms depending on the personal health conditions, lifestyle, and genome information, universal healthcare is not effective for some patients, and it can even generate severe side effects. Thus, research on the AI-based healthcare that is in the form of mining-based smart health, which is a convergence technology of the 4IR, is actively being carried out. Particularly, the introduction of various smart medical equipment for which healthcare big data and a running machine have been combined and the expansion of the distribution of smartphone wearable devices have led to innovations such as personalized diagnostic and treatment services and chronic-disease management and prevention services. In addition, various already launched applications allow users to check their own health conditions and receive the corresponding feedback in real time. Based on these innovations, the preparation of a way to determine a user’s current health conditions, and to respond properly through contextual feedback in the case of unsound health conditions, is underway. However, since the previously made healthcare-related applications need to be linked to a wearable device, and they provide medical feedback to users based solely on specific biometric data, inaccurate information can be provided. In addition, the user interfaces of some healthcare applications are very complicated, causing user inconvenience regarding the attainment of desired information. Therefore, we propose a chatbot-based healthcare service with a knowledge base for cloud computing. The proposed method is a mobile health service in the form of a chatbot for the provision of fast treatment in response to accidents that may occur in everyday life, and also in response to changes of the conditions of patients with chronic diseases. A chatbot is an intelligent conversation platform that interacts with users via a chatting interface, and since its use can be facilitated by linkages with the major social network service messengers, general users can easily access and receive various health services. The proposed framework enables a smooth human–robot interaction that supports the efficient implementation of the chatbot healthcare service. The design of the framework comprises the following four levels: data level, information level, knowledge level, and service level.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10586-018-2334-5,springer

The paper also describes a beat-pattern classification algorithm to sub classify premature beat-patterns into bigeminy, trigeminy and quadrigeminy. The approach utilizes two phases: (1) a training phase that builds bivariate Markov model from standardized databases of ECG signals, and (2) a dynamic phase that detects embedded P and R waves in T-waves of premature beats using a combination of area subtraction and clinically significant rule-based analysis of R-R intervals. It detects and classifies premature beats using graph matching based upon the forward-backward algorithm and performs a look ahead pattern analysis for the sub-classification of beat-patterns. The algorithms have been presented. The software has been implemented that uses a combination of MATLAB and C++ libraries. Performance results show that processing time is realistic for real-time detection with 98%–99% sensitivity for the premature beat classification and 95%-98% sensitivity for the beat pattern identification.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-01057-7_22,springer

A comparative chest disease diagnosis has been realized in this study by using the following neural networks such as multi-layer, probabilistic, learning vector quantization, constructive fuzzy, focused time delay, and generalized regression neural networks [ 1 ]. The back-propagation algorithm (It is a method used to calculate the error contribution of each neuron after a batch of data has been processed. It is the workhorse of learning in neural networks.) is the most popular algorithm in feed-forward neural network [ 1 ] with a multi-layer system. By adjusting the weights of artificial neural network while moving along the descending gradient direction is applicable to calculate the output error as well as the gradient of the error. The theme is to propose the implementation of back-propagation algorithm to compute and compare the percentage of the output accuracy, which is used for medical diagnosis on various chest diseases (i.e., asthma [ 2 ], tuberculosis [ 1 , 3 ], lung cancer [ 4 ]; it is an iterative procedure that generates pneumonia).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-13-0866-6_11,springer

First, support vector machine (SVM) and popular neural network approaches are implemented and compared. Results show that while the neural network-based method is very efficient in many high-dimensional applications, such as video, SVM performs well enough for intelligent fault diagnosis. Second, the relation between the number of samples and the efficiency of diagnosis are studied, Findings indicate that a small number of samples can produce an optimal result.

With sensors becoming increasingly fast, frameworks such as Deep Neural Networks are required to perform calculations within the strict timing constraints for real-time operation. However, traditional computing platforms responsible for running these algorithms incur a large overhead due to communication protocols, memory accesses, and static (often generic) architectures. In this work, we implement a low-latency Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) processor using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Unlike CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), our FPGA-based design can directly interface sensors, storage devices, display devices and even actuators, thus reducing the delays of data movement between ports and compute pipelines. Moreover, the compute pipelines themselves are tailored specifically to the application, improving resource utilization and reducing idle cycles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using mass-spectrometry data sets for real-time cancer detection. Results We demonstrate that correct parameter sizing, based on the application, can reduce latency by 20% on average. Furthermore, we show that in an application with tightly coupled data-path and latency constraints, having a large amount of computing resources can actually reduce performance. Using mass-spectrometry benchmarks, we show that our proposed FPGA design outperforms both CPU and GPU implementations, with an average speedup of 144x and 21x, respectively. Conclusion In our work, we demonstrate the importance of application-specific optimizations in order to minimize latency and maximize resource utilization for MLP inference. By directly interfacing and processing sensor data with ultra-low latency, FPGAs can perform real-time analysis during procedures and provide diagnostic feedback that can be critical to achieving higher percentages of successful patient outcomes.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12859-018-2505-7,springer

It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain proper life balance . The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, naïve bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual.

Therefore, the diagnosis of its abnormal situation has always drawn enormous attention from both domestic and international scholars. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a widely used method in transformer fault diagnosis field. However, the conventional DGA is not well suitable for transformer fault diagnosis because transformer’s structure is complex and operating environment is changeable. On the other hand, the back propagation (BP) neural network, frequently employed in related field, also has some inherent disadvantages, such as local optimization, over-fitting and difficulties in convergence. So simply integrating conventional DGA to BP is not a good approach for fault diagnosis. Moreover, disturbance or noises within the training data, which is unavoidable due to systematic errors, may greatly influence the accuracy of diagnosis model with the growing size of the data. Thus, in this study, we integrate a combination ratio of taking advantages of IEC and Doernenburg, instead of usual DGA, into genetic algorithm (GA) and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM) optimized BP, successfully building a novel model which has not been reported previously. Our results show this model has a better diagnosis accuracy rate and generalization ability than other models, and FCM and GA can significantly overcome the disadvantages of training data and BP, offering the potential of implementation for real-time diagnosis systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-015-2001-6,springer

Mobile phones are powerful social sensors that are usually physically close to users and leave digital traces of users’ behaviors and movement patterns. New Apps (application or piece of software) are emerging that passively collect and analyze mobile phone data of at-risk patients such as their location, calling and texting records and app usage, and can find deviations in a user’s daily patterns to detect that something is wrong before an event occurs. Data mining and machine learning techniques are adopted to analyze the “automated diaries” created by the smart phone and monitor the well-being of people. The App first learns a patients daily behavioral patterns using machine learning techniques. Once trained, the App detects deviations and alerts carers based on predictive models. This paper describes the techniques used and algorithms for reality mining and predictive analysis used in eHealth Apps.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19156-0_1,springer

Stakeholders will need to evaluate current record keeping practices and optimize and standardize methodologies to capture nearly all information in digital format. Collaborative efforts from academic and industry sectors are crucial to achieving higher efficacy in patient care while minimizing costs. Currently existing digitized data and information are present in multiple formats and are largely unstructured. In the absence of a universally accepted management system, departments and institutions continue to generate silos of information. As a result, invaluable and newly discovered knowledge is difficult to access. To accelerate biomedical research and reduce healthcare costs, clinical and bioinformatics systems must employ common data elements to create structured annotation forms enabling laboratories and clinics to capture sharable data in real time. Conversion of these datasets to knowable information should be a routine institutionalized process. New scientific knowledge and clinical discoveries can be shared via integrated knowledge environments defined by flexible data models and extensive use of standards, ontologies, vocabularies, and thesauri. In the clinical setting, aggregated knowledge must be displayed in user-friendly formats so that physicians, non-technical laboratory personnel, nurses, data/research coordinators, and end-users can enter data, access information, and understand the output. The effort to connect astronomical numbers of data points, including ‘-omics’-based molecular data, individual genome sequences, experimental data, patient clinical phenotypes, and follow-up data is a monumental task. Roadblocks to this vision of integration and interoperability include ethical, legal, and logistical concerns. Ensuring data security and protection of patient rights while simultaneously facilitating standardization is paramount to maintaining public support. The capabilities of supercomputing need to be applied strategically. A standardized, methodological implementation must be applied to developed artificial intelligence systems with the ability to integrate data and information into clinically relevant knowledge. Ultimately, the integration of bioinformatics and clinical data in a clinical decision support system promises precision medicine and cost effective and personalized patient care.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s13336-015-0019-3,springer

However, there is no work available that investigates the performance of ML-based methods against the text expression-based method, especially for incident and medical case categorization. Meanwhile, these two domains are becoming ever more popular, due to a growing interest of automation in security intelligence and health services. This paper presents a text expression-based method called Evolving Fuzzy Grammar (EFG) and evaluates its performance against the conventional ML methods of Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, $$k$$ k -nearest neighbor, adaptive booting, and decision tree. The incident dataset used is a real dataset that was taken from the World Incidents Tracking System, while ImageCLEF 2009 was used as the source for radiology case reports. The results suggested variations of strength and weakness of each method in both categorization tasks, where a standard evaluation technique (i.e., recall, precision, and $$F$$ F -measure) was used. In both domains, the SMO and IBk methods were the best, while AdaBoost was the worst. It was also observed that the medical dataset was easier to categorize than the incident. Although EFG was ranked second lowest, it obtained the highest precision score in the bombing categorization, the highest score in armed attack recall, and was averagely ranked in the top three for the medical case categorization. It was also noted that the text expression-based method used in EFG was the most verbose and expressive, when compared to the ML methods. This indicates that EFG is a viable method in text categorization and may serve as an alternative approach to such a task.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-014-1358-x,springer

Recombinant and highly purified allergens belonging to different allergenic sources (inhalants, food, latex and hymenoptera) are present in the array. These components can either be genuine or cross-reactive, resistant or susceptible to heat and low pH, and innocuous or potentially dangerous. A large number of complex and heterogeneous relationships among these components has emerged, such that sometimes these interactions cannot be effectively managed by the allergist. In the 1960s, specialized languages and environments were developed to support the replacement of human experts with dedicated decision-making information systems. Currently, expert systems (ES) are advanced informatics tools that are widely used in medicine, engineering, finance and trading. Methods We developed an ES, named Allergenius ®, to support the interpretation of allergy tests based on microarray technology (ImmunoCAP ISAC ®). The ES was implemented using Flex, a LPA Win-Prolog shell. Rules representing the knowledge base (KB) were derived from the literature and specialized databases. The input data included the patient’s ID and disease(s), the results of either a skin prick test or specific IgE assays and ISAC results. The output was a medical report. Results The ES was first validated using artificial and real life cases and passed all in silico validations. Then, the opinions of allergists with experience in molecular diagnostics were compared with the ES reports. The Allergenius reports included all of the allergists’ opinions and considerations, as well as any additional information. Conclusions Allergenius is a trustable ES dedicated to molecular tests for allergy. In the present version, it provides a powerful method to understand ISAC results and to obtain a comprehensive interpretation of the patient’s IgE profiling.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1939-4551-7-15,springer

When a fault happens, both financial losses and undesired situations may occur. For these reasons, it is important to detect the incipient faults of SRMs and to diagnose which faults have occurred. In this study, a test rig was realized to determine the healthy and faulty conditions of SRMs. A data set for the Kohonen neural network was created with implemented measurements. A graphical user interface (GUI) was created in Matlab to test the performance of the Kohonen artificial neural network in real time. The data of the SRM was transferred to this software with a data acquisition card. The condition of the motor was monitored by marking the data measured in real time on the weight position graph of the Kohonen neural network. This test rig is capable of real-time monitoring of the condition of SRMs, which are used with intermittent or continuous operation, and is capable of detecting and diagnosing the faults that may occur in the motor. The Kohonen neural network used for detection and diagnosis of faults of the SRM in real time with Matlab GUI was embedded in an STM32 processor.

However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting “alert fatigue” and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of “big data” in health care provide the potential not only to perform “in silico” research but also to provide “real time” diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. “On demand” access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine.

The health care provider can be in any location with the correct equipment, and view the digital image. The dimensions of this discussion are extensive. The cost savings because of reduced media and storage cost is substantial. Health care quality can be improved because of the ability to obtain consultation via telemedicine and the enhanced ability to track medical problems over time via trends. The major downside is the limited cost imbursement system to pay for technology. Unfortunately, this may impact on the improved quality of care. In simple terms someone needs to pay for the technology and the quality of health care needs to be maintained or improved. The real cost to the health care systems needs to be correctly calculated and inappropriate charging kept to a minimum. Specific costs need to be kept in mind and the first is the cost for new staff or staff training. The number of health care providers that are able to read the X-ray can be enlarged remembering that only American Board Certified Radiologists are allowed to give the final recommendation. How do we view the cost of missing something? It could be argued that this risk will be reduced because of improved technology for obtaining the digital X-ray and improved enhancement software. One way to view this situation is to include technology, management, and organization. The cost and benefits occur through the interplay of all three dimensions. The development of digital imaging hardware and artificial intelligence software will demand change in the management and organization. The organization will require changes in its design to accommodate the technology as to support and resources. Management will evolve to include methods for control and monitoring this technology. Business processes and standard operating procedures will change to integrate the technology into the organization in the most effective and efficient manner.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10916-005-5891-0,springer

Designed following the natural laws of evolution, which merge self-organization and natural selection [1], these socially embedded information infrastructures can adapt to fulfill various needs as their environment demands. Computational intelligence techniques endow the AIIs with learning and discovery capabilities, emulating social and biological behavior. AIIs are destined to become an integral part of our life by supporting, rather than disturbing, a framework that facilitates strategic partnerships while providing greater user-friendliness, more efficient services support, user-empowerment, and support for human interactions.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/11494676_3,springer

It is claimed that experts use two complex mental processes when interpreting such data, knowledge-based reasoning and pattern recognition. It is argued that existing classification methods are inadequate and that the application of advanced computer-based techniques is vital to the realisation of the full potential of biological monitoring. The paper then concentrates on a pattern recognition approach and demonstrates how Self Organising Maps (SOM), a type of unsupervised-learning neural network, can be used to classify and diagnose river quality. A brief introduction is given to the theory of SOMs and the interpretation of their output, as expressed in feature maps and class templates. SOMs are developed using two different methods of accounting for the confounding effects of environmental factors, and their relative performances are compared. Some improvements to the SOM architecture and functionality that are currently being implemented are briefly described, together with plans to use information theory for the assessment of performance. Finally, it is concluded that the methods of classification/diagnosis described in the paper have considerable potential not only in river quality monitoring, but also in other environmental fields.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-35503-0_4,springer

Starting from a diagnosis of abnormality in a system or apparatus, the model identifies the organ affected, and determines which of the possible illnesses is the one we are faced with in a particular case. The resoning is based on a tree-like structure divided into a set of three levels, assuming that greater sensitivity and less specificity of the questions, clinical variables, and the signs and symptoms to be taken into consideration is found at level I than at level III. Each time that the system is consulted for a real patient, the system offers the possibility to register all the parameters in a data base. The modules, rules, and diagnoses are registered and compared with physicians1 judgment. The study of conflicting patterns helps to analyze clinical judgment and rule-based reasoning techniques in greater depth. The system is being implemented for more than one year and the data from 825 patients introduced are being currently assessed.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-93503-9_50,springer

An artificial neural network is a computational structure modeled somewhat on the neural structure of the brain; both have many highly interconnected processing elements. These biologically inspired processing elements are taught by feeding examples until the results are acceptable. In the past 5 years, neural networks have become successful in providing meaningful second opinions in clinical diagnosis. In our research, a prototype artificial neural network was trained on numeral ultrasound data of 52 actual cases and then correctly identified renal cell carcinoma from renal cysts and other conditions without diagnostic errors. Our nonlinear artificial neural network was trained on software using the standard backpropagation paradigm on a 80386 microcomputer. Our ANN learned from ultrasound data in 52 cases (17 malignant, 30 cysts, and 5 other) at a Memphis hospital. The trained prototype performed without error on 47 cases which were not in the data used for training. This prototype must be validated by extending this study to more cases.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF00993877,springer
