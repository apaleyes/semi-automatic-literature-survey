10.1109/I2MTC.2018.8409699,A new method for the indicator of dynamic scheduling in life science laboratories using artificial neural networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, a growing number of automation systems is applied in life science laboratories to increase the throughput and accuracy of the experiments. Meanwhile, complex investigations require cooperative work, which includes multiple automated workstations. In order to face the great challenge of the resource distribution, a hybrid scheduler is used to generate the time schedule before the execution and after an unexpected situation for the dynamic scheduling. The indicator, presented in this paper, can trigger the rescheduling procedure when the trigger conditions are satisfied and offer the transportation balance factor, which is the most important parameter for dynamic scheduling. An artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to learn the relationship between the system operation data and the transportation balance factor. Then the ANN can forecast the balance factor fast and accurately based on the real current data of the system operation. Finally, an experiment proves that the proposed method is suitable to trigger the dynamic scheduling and accurate to generate the balance factor for the rescheduling, which provides a correct solution based on the unexpected situation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8409699/,2018 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC),14-17 May 2018,ieeexplore

The platform, called PredictCS, automatically detects lower-performing or “at-risk” students in programming courses and automatically and adaptively sends them feedback. This system has been progressively adopted at the classroom level to improve personalized learning. A visual analytics dashboard is developed and accessible to Faculty. This contains information about the models deployed and insights extracted from student's data. By leveraging historical student data we built predictive models using student characteristics, prior academic history, logged interactions between students and online resources, and students' progress in programming laboratory work. Predictions were generated every week during the semester's classes. In addition, during the second half of the semester, students who opted-in received pseudo real-time personalised feedback. Notifications were personalised based on students' predicted performance on the course and included a programming suggestion from a top-student in the class if any programs submitted had failed to meet the specified criteria. As a result, this helped students who corrected their programs to learn more and reduced the gap between lower and higher-performing students.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658596/,2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),3-6 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

Database integration, consequently, is a fundamental prerequisite to be able to answer complex biological questions. Due to the presence of syntactic, schematic, and semantic heterogeneities, large scale database integration at present takes considerable efforts. As there is a growing apprehension of extensible markup language (XML) as a means for data exchange in the life sciences, this article focuses on the impact of XML technology on database integration in this area. In detail, a general architecture for ontology-driven data integration based on XML technology is introduced, which overcomes some of the traditional problems in this area.

The result of applying goal-oriented methods, which are top-down requirements analysis, is in most cases a goal graph. Goal graphs are implemented from customers needs as initial goals to requirements specifications as final goals. Their analysis includes negotiation as an important issue, which becomes extremely difficult, as clients often cannot know exactly what they need. To overcome this situation, aiming at improving stakeholder's negotiation, we reduce the gap of misunderstanding between them by the use of cognitive science.

10.1109/ISORC49007.2020.00030,A Cross-Layer Review of Deep Learning Frameworks to Ease Their Optimization and Reuse,IEEE,Conferences,"Machine learning and especially Deep Learning (DL) approaches are at the heart of many domains, from computer vision and speech processing to predicting trajectories in autonomous driving and data science. Those approaches mainly build upon Neural Networks (NNs), which are compute-intensive in nature. A plethora of frameworks, libraries and platforms have been deployed for the implementation of those NNs, but end users often lack guidance on what frameworks, platforms and libraries to use to obtain the best implementation for their particular needs. This paper analyzes the DL ecosystem providing a structured view of some of the main frameworks, platforms and libraries for DL implementation. We show how those DL applications build ultimately on some form of linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, vector addition, dot product and the like.

Hence, it is very important to reduce such network outages. Prediction of such failures would be a step forward to avoid such disruption of internet services for users as well as operators. Several research proposals are available in the literature which are applications of data science and machine learning techniques. Most of the techniques rely on significant amount of real time data collection. Network devices are assumed to be equipped to collect data and these are then analysed by different algorithms to predict failures. Every network element which is already deployed in the field may not have these data gathering or analysis techniques designed into them initially. However, such mechanisms become necessary later when they are already deployed in the field. This paper proposes a Bayesian network based failure prediction of network nodes, g., routers etc., using very basic information from the log files of the devices and applying power law based data augmentation to complement for scarce real time information. Numerical results show that network node failure prediction can be performed with high accuracy using the proposed mechanism.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9415186/,2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Information and Communication (ICAIIC),13-16 April 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00201,A Deep Learning Approach to Sensory Navigation Device for Blind Guidance,IEEE,Conferences,"Sensory navigation device is an important trend in the field of machine learning and data science. Nowadays, more and more sensory navigation devices are built for blind people. The core of such sensory navigation devices for blind people usually is implemented by an Image Recognition Method. To build an image recognition model, many tools and online machine learning platforms are proposed. However, these tools or platforms are not able to completely satisfy the requirements for sensory navigation device. To build a sensory navigation device with satisfying requirements for blind people, an ability of reducing the cost of model training and a capability of user-centric image recognition are the two main issues. Therefore, to address the above issues, we propose a novel approach, namely, DLSNF (Deep-Learning-based Sensory Navigation Framework). Our proposed DLSNF is built based on the YOLO architecture to deal with the reducing cost of model training and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 to take the user-centric image recognition into account. Based on our proposed DLSNF, the real-time image recognition can be trained well and conduct a sensory navigation to help blind people. At the same time, the train model is embedded in NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which is the fastest, most power-efficient embedded AI computing device. For the experiments, we evaluated our proposed DLSNF with a real-world dataset consisting of 4,570 images collected by part-time workers. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed DLSNF more effectively and efficiently beyond the existing baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622939/,2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),28-30 June 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/IDAP.2018.8620736,A Framework Based on Compiler Design Techniques for Programming Learning Environments,IEEE,Conferences,"It has been observed that the studies for starting programming learning at an early age have increased in recent years. Programming that enhances the high level cognitive skills of individuals is seen as a competency that must be acquired for everyone nowadays. In current programming learning environments, programming is usually done using visual components. However, it is emphasized that there is little contribution to the transition to actual programming languages by programming with visual components in the studies carried out. For this reason, a new programming learning environment has been developed in this study in which everyone can learn programming. To facilitate programming learning and contribute to the transition of actual programming languages, a new programming language is described which is simple syntax and similar to real programming languages. This language is controlled in terms of meaning and grammar with lexical and syntax analysis steps. The specified compiler design techniques are implemented using finite state machines. Analysis of the created programming language is performed by regular expressions. Instead of providing a free workspace for the user, an environment with quests covering programming concepts is presented. This quest based environment aims at the successful learning process by guiding to the user through feedbacks.

However, ML methods usually require intensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders the practical deployment of ML models. In view of this, this paper proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework for speed prediction, which enables the prediction work to be accomplished in a much more timesaving and convenient way as well as in high prediction accuracy. The proposed framework utilizes the Genetic Algorithm (GA) following its four major procedures: Genome coding, Crossover, Mutation and Selection to automatically search for the optimal neural network architectures and hyperparameters. The proposed framework is examined on a real-world large-scale dataset in the city of Berlin, Germany.

10.1109/CESA.2006.4281933,A Knowledge-Based Approach for Semantic Service Composition,IEEE,Conferences,"The successful application of grid and Web service technologies to real-world problems, such as e-Science, requires not only the development of a common vocabulary and meta-data framework as the basis for inter-agent communication and service integration but also the access and use of a rich repository of domain-specific knowledge for problem solving. Both requirements are met by the respective outcomes of ontological and knowledge engineering initiatives. In this paper we discuss a novel, knowledge-based approach to resource synthesis (service composition), which draws on the functionality of semantic Web services to represent and expose available resources. The approach we use exploits domain knowledge to guide the service composition process and provide advice on service selection and instantiation. The approach has been implemented in a prototype workflow construction environment that supports the runtime recommendation of a service solution, service discovery via semantic service descriptions, and knowledge-based configuration of selected services. The use of knowledge provides a basis for full automation of service composition via conventional planning algorithms. Workflows produced by this system can be executed through a domain-specific direct mapping mechanism or via a more fluid approach such as WSDL- based service grounding.

The current review papers lack an explanation of deep learning algorithms in personality trait recognition. So we perform this study to classify the latest deep learning algorithms in personality trait recognition.

10.1109/FCCM.2017.58,Accelerating Large-Scale Graph Analytics with FPGA and HMC,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph analytics that explores the relationship among interconnected entities is becoming increasingly important due to its broad applicability from machine learning to social science. However, one major challenge for graph processing systems is the irregular data access pattern of graph computation which can significantly degrade the performance. The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit. The merging unit takes the best advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluated the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications.

The proposed approach makes use of Manual Acquisition System measurements and combine them with a clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) and baseline methods (Multiple Linear Regression and thresholds based on standard deviation) to create a method that is able to identify and remove most of the outliers in the datasets used for demonstration and evaluation.

Recently, community structure has been considered as an important character for complex networks, and its detection can bring great benefit in real world affairs. In the paper, a new heuristic algorithm based on two-point diffusing strategy is proposed. At first, two pseudo-core points are identified according to the clue of the longest path in a network. Then, two embryonic communities and an undecided node set are generated through performing diffusing operation on such two points. Subsequently, an experience rule is used to classify the undecided nodes to form the final community structure. In addition, the effectiveness and efficiency are validated by comparison experiments with four real-world networks.

The project takes into account the analysis and processing of multifaceted archaeological evidences in a context-oriented environment, in which interdisciplinary contributions of several scientist are combined and integrated, in order to grasp the original system of interaction of different branches of the ancient reality. Such a cooperation needs a system of ""query/communication"" able to integrate archaeological data, artefacts and architectural structures (subsoil and over-ground), cartographic and photographic documentation and scientific contents, achieved in the past and implemented during the field research. The proposed ecosystem aims to provide a set of services for federating different existing data-sources (GIS, including 3D tools), through the definition of a semantic network of relationships among landscapes, stratigraphic layers, structures and artefacts of an excavation site (ArchMatrix). This ecosystem is based on an innovative global design method, focused on the management of raw-data captured and analyzed by different experts in a collaborative way. The aim is to develop a solution able to support analyses and studies grounded in the real needs of the archaeological investigation, by enabling archaeologists in producing archaeological and historical interpretations starting from the real core of the documentation they deal with.

Evaluation of results show that Bellman's equation can be used in path decision processes for ant agent robotic devices.

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool.

Its goal is to design and implement text documents classifier prototype based on documents similarity and to design evaluation and crowdsourcing-based classification improvement mechanism. For classification the N-grams algorithm has been chosen, which was implemented in Java. Interface for crowdsourcing was created using CMS WordPress. In addition to data collection, the purpose of interface is to evaluate classification accuracy, which leads to extension of classifier test data set, thus the classification is more successful. We have tested our approach on two data sets with promising preliminary results even across different languages.

10.1109/BigData.2018.8622509,Deep Learning for Enhancing Fault Tolerant Capabilities of Scientific Workflows,IEEE,Conferences,"In the history of Computer Science, the act of `delegation' has been the greatest multiplier of society's problem-solving ability. A scientist working on detecting anomalies in a phenomenon, does not need to re-invent matrix multiplication techniques to solve her problem. Scientific workflows provide ultimate `delegation' mechanism - where a domain scientist can completely forget the specifics of `how' her program will execute on a large cluster in an efficient and cost-effective manner and can instead focus on the mathematical formulation and theoretical robustness of her solution. We present here an approach that directly aims to make the execution of Scientific Workflows more reliable, robust and efficient. We aim that the work presented in this paper will propel the larger effort, from the scientific workflow community, of making scientific workflow execution as simple, efficient and robust as a JOIN operation in a modern database. Specifically, we apply Deep Learning techniques to develop a mechanism that forecasts the final state (success or failure) of a dynamic job in a large-scale particle physics experiment, with minimal data gathering, and as early as possible in job's life cycle. The key advantage of having a predictive mechanism to identify and anticipate failure-prone jobs is the potential for designing intelligent Fault Tolerance mechanisms to handle anomalous events. We achieve a 14% improvement in computational resources utilization, and an overall classification accuracy of 85% on real tasks executed in a High Energy Physics Computing workflow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most exhaustive and first of its kind study of neural network architectures in context of a real-dataset profiled from a large-scale scientific workflow.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622509/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

However, the fuzzy concept is particularly valid also in the areas where information is qualitative. Exact science applications deal with the information by modeling and thereafter identifying the relationships in the model by suitable computation. In contrast, the fuzzy logic employment in soft sciences is not as straightforward as it is in exact sciences and special care should be taken in the former case. Analogous to exact sciences, the majority of soft information sources belongs to soft sciences where the quantities dealt with are usually not measurable in the engineering sense. Therefore, for soft sciences fuzzy logic is an important means for dealing with associated imprecise information processing. In spite of this, the employment of fuzzy logic in soft sciences is not common. In this work, aspects of fuzzy logic implementation in the areas of soft sciences is pointed out.

In order to solve the problem of real-time and miniaturization of target tracking system, this paper applies a tracking algorithm based on KNN(k-nearest neighbor) background splitter combined with Kalman filter. When tracking a moving target, it is important to determine the moving target in the initial frame. In this paper, the motion detection method in KNN background segmentation is adopted to automatically initialize the moving target. Kalman filter can predict the motion state of the moving target in the next frame according to the information of the moving target in the current frame, and track the target with the predicted value as the input of CamShift algorithm.

Complementary and alternative to supervised machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. However, powerful modern supercomputers provide the opportunity to narrow the gap between theory and practical application. We present our first step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. In several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in capturing physically meaningful coherent structures from observational and simulated scientific data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the first application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing good performance along with ensuring domain scientists' productivity. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed and optimized DisCo workflow and libraries, performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer obtaining 91% weak-scaling and 64% strong-scaling efficiency.

10.1109/CSNet47905.2019.9108976,Dynamic security management driven by situations: An exploratory analysis of logs for the identification of security situations,IEEE,Conferences,"Situation awareness consists of ""the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future"". Being aware of the security situation is then mandatory to launch proper security reactions in response to cybersecurity attacks. Security Incident and Event Management solutions are deployed within Security Operation Centers. Some vendors propose machine learning based approaches to detect intrusions by analysing networks behaviours. But cyberattacks like Wannacry and NotPetya, which shut down hundreds of thousands of computers, demonstrated that networks monitoring and surveillance solutions remain insufficient. Detecting these complex attacks (a.k.a. Advanced Persistent Threats) requires security administrators to retain a large number of logs just in case problems are detected and involve the investigation of past security events. This approach generates massive data that have to be analysed at the right time in order to detect any accidental or caused incident. In the same time, security administrators are not yet seasoned to such a task and lack the desired skills in data science. As a consequence, a large amount of data is available and still remains unexplored which leaves number of indicators of compromise under the radar. Building on the concept of situation awareness, we developed a situation-driven framework, called dynSMAUG, for dynamic security management. This approach simplifies the security management of dynamic systems and allows the specification of security policies at a high-level of abstraction (close to security requirements). This invited paper aims at exposing real security situations elicitation, coming from networks security experts, and showing the results of exploratory analysis techniques using complex event processing techniques to identify and extract security situations from a large volume of logs.

10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117546,Latent-to-full palmprint comparison based on radial triangulation under forensic conditions,IEEE,Conferences,"In forensic applications the evidential value of palmprints is obvious according to surveys of law enforcement agencies which indicate that 30 percent of the latents recovered from crime scenes are from palms. Consequently, developing forensic automatic palmprint identification technology is an urgent and challenging task which deals with latent (i.e., partial) and full palmprints captured or recovered at 500 ppi at least (the current standard in forensic applications) for minutiae-based offline recognition. Moreover, a rigorous quantification of the evidential value of biometrics, such as fingerprints and palmprints, is essential in modern forensic science. Recently, radial triangulation has been proposed as a step towards this objective in fingerprints, using minutiae manually extracted by experts. In this work we help in automatizing such comparison strategy, and generalize it to palmprints. Firstly, palmprint segmentation and enhancement are implemented for full prints feature extraction by a commercial biometric SDK in an automatic way, while features of latent prints are manually extracted by forensic experts. Then a latent-to-full palmprint comparison algorithm based on radial triangulation is proposed, in which radial triangulation is utilized for minutiae modeling. Finally, 22 latent palmprints from real forensic cases and 8680 full palmprints from criminal investigation field are used for performance evaluation. Experimental results proof the usability and efficiency of the proposed system, i.e, rank-l identification rate of 62% is achieved despite the inherent difficulty of latent-to-full palmprint comparison.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6117546/,2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB),11-13 Oct. 2011,ieeexplore
10.1109/OCEANS.2018.8604686,Learned Anticipation Strategy on Complex Behaviors and as an Approach to Generalization Behavior for the Coordination of an AUV Fleet,IEEE,Conferences,"Anticipation is natural behavior seen in certain organisms when they try to adapt their behavior to create an accurate reaction to an event that will happen in the future based on sequential information that extracted from the environment and other organisms. Anticipation has been studied from both the human and the animal perspectives and science has been taking some of these ideas to implement this behavior in machines. Research and studies of anticipation using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods has been growing during the past years within different fields, including Robotics, Stock Market, Weather Forecast, Social Media, among others. At the University of Idaho, we have been focusing on studying Anticipation using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). This paper analyzes the impact on coordination of including an anticipation module to adapt to complex behaviors and to make decisions based on generalization while running as part of a simulation of a fleet of AUVs following a magnetic signature assessment (MSA) task. During this task, a moving Target Ship (TS) shares information about its behavior with the fleet of AUVs while the fleet tries to maintain formation and reach a designated meeting point at the same time as the TS. The TS behaviors include sudden and/or complex changes in movement during the experiment. These changes in the TS's movement make it difficult for the AUVs to reach the meeting point at the same time as the TS without additional information. Progress messages from the TS are used by the AUVs to adjust their behavior, but the messages may be sparse. A portion of the data that represents the TS's behavior was used as training data for the anticipation module in the AUVs. The remaining data was used as brand new cases that the anticipation module would try to solve to encourage generalization. Generalization occurs when the robot can solve a task that it was not trained for, but there was sufficient training data to result in reasonable solutions. For these experiments, the messages that are sent by the TS to the AUVs report the TS's progress to the goal. The TS reports its progress using Fuzzy set membership values. This strategy is used to model real-world situations where progress cannot be defined with exact values. The membership values are represented by fuzzy sets including On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Ahead of Schedule, etc. This strategy gives a more human-like approach to the AUVs for decision making because humans often say things like “I'm a little behind schedule”. The anticipation module works as an aid for the communication between the TS and the fleet of AUVs. It tries to keep the fleet running on track and synchronized with the TS behavior by filling in missing messages with an anticipated message. In this research it is assumed that missing and corrupt messages occur because of a noisy or low-bandwidth communications. The experiments simulate this condition by sending messages more infrequently. The TS stops broadcasting messages for a specific time period that has been selected before starting the test. Versions of the anticipation module, using a Neural Network model and a Fuzzy Logic model were tested. To have comparable results, the position of the meeting point is constant during each experiment and is used as a point of reference. The effectiveness of the anticipation module was evaluated by measuring the distance between the actual meeting point of the fleet of AUVs and the TS and the desired meeting point. In general the anticipation module reduced the error significantly. This included the tests using the novel behaviors that were not part of the training set. These last results lead to the idea that, with the right training data, the AUVs are displaying generalization behavior. In general, the anticipation module helps the fleet of AUVs to infer the behavior of the TS and they synchronize to the TS even when there was a lack of information, caused by missing messages.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8604686/,OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE Charleston,22-25 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9002803,Learning of Multivariate Beta Mixture Models via Entropy-based component splitting,IEEE,Conferences,"Finite mixture models are progressively employed in various fields of science due to their high potential as inference engines to model multimodal and complex data. To develop them, we face some crucial issues such as choosing proper distributions with enough flexibility to well-fit the data. To learn our model, two other significant challenges, namely, parameter estimation and defining model complexity have to be addressed. Some methods such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference have been widely considered to tackle the first problem and both have some drawbacks such as local maxima or high computational complexity. Simultaneously, the proper number of components was determined with some approaches such as minimum message length. In this work, multivariate Beta mixture models have been deployed thanks to their flexibility and we propose a novel variational inference via an entropy-based splitting method.

10.1109/PDP50117.2020.00041,Lessons learned from comparing C-CUDA and Python-Numba for GPU-Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Python as programming language is increasingly gaining importance, especially in data science, scientific, and parallel programming. It is faster and easier to learn than classical programming languages such as C. However, usability often comes at the cost of performance and applications written in Python are considered to be much slower than applications written in C or FORTRAN. Further, it does not allow the usage of GPUs-besides of pre-compiled libraries.However, the Numba package promises performance similar to C code for compute intensive parts of a Python application and it supports CUDA, which allows the use of GPUs inside a Python application.In this paper we compare the performance of Numba-CUDA and C -CUDA for different kinds of applications. For compute intensive benchmarks, the performance of the Numba version only reaches between 50% and 85% performance of the CCUDA version, despite the reduction operation, where the Numba version outperforms CUDA. Analyzing the PTX code and CUDA performance counters revealed that index-calculation is one limiting factor in Numba. Another problem is the type interference for single precision computations, as some values are computed in double precision. By optimizing this within the Numba package, the performance of Numba improves. However, C-CUDA applications still outperform the Numba versions. Further analysis with the CloverLeav Mini App shows that Numba performance further decreases for applications with multiple different compute kernels. The non-GPU part slows down these applications, due to the slow Python interpreter. This leads to a worse GPU utilization.Today Python is widely used in industry and academia and has been the first choice of coding languages among software programmers in the last years. Currently, according to the TIOBE index [5], it is the 3rd most popular programming language and the number one in IEEE Spectrum's fifth annual interactive ranking of the top programming languages [4]. One reason for this is that is easier to learn than classical programming languages like C. However, the other reason is the increasing popularity of Data Science, where Python is the most used language. A collection of libraries such as NumPy [22], and Matplotlib [1] or Scipy [8] provide a rich set of functions for scientific computing [16]. Packages like Dask [19], PyCompss [21] and MPI for Python [6] allow running Python applications on large, parallel machines, promising high performance. However, the performance of Python is considered slow compared to compiled languages such as C, C++, and FORTRAN, especially for heavy computations. In recent years, more and more tools have been developed to counter this prejudice. Numpy [22], for example, uses C-like arrays to store data and offers fast functions implemented in C to speed up calculations. The CuPy [14] package provides a similar set of functions, but these functions are implemented for GPUs using CUDA. The SciPy library is based on NumPy and provides a rich set on functionalities for scientific computing. Still, the high performance of these libraries is provided by the underling C-implementations. Internally, they use libraries like OpenBlas or IntelMKL to reach high performance and therefore, they are limited by the functions which are provided by theses libraries. Therefore, a performance problem always arises when the required functionality is not implemented within these libraries. In this case, the application falls back to the Python interpreter. Compared to ""bare metal"" code, interpreted code is slow. In addition, in Python it is not possible to use GPUs or other accelerators directly, as the Python interpreter cannot execute code on these machines. Therefore, the usage is only possible with precompiled libraries. To overcome this limitation, different approaches where developed to mix C, CUDA or OpenCL with Python. Cython [2] allows integrating C-code in Python applications to improve performance of critical sections. It also allows an easy development of wrappers for C-libraries. Similar, packages such as PyCuda and PyOpenCL [9] support wrappers for CUDA or OpenCL code within a Python script. Both approaches require the mixture of different programming languages.Numba [10] follows a different approach. Instead of merging C/CUDA code with Python, it allows the development of efficient applications for both, CPUs and GPUs in Python style. When a Python script using Numba is executed, marked functions are compiled just-in-time (JIT) using the LLVM framework. Using Python for GPU programming can mean a considerable simplification in the development of parallel applications.But often a simplification of comes at the expense of performance, and one expects a performance loss from Python compared to pure C code. In this paper, we want to understand the differences between native C-CUDA code and CUDA-code written in Python with Numba. We also want to share some basic tips how to improve the performance of applications written in Numba.We will first analyse a few micro benchmarks in detail. We are using these simple benchmarks, as it is easier to understand the differences with small code examples. We will use the collected information to derive some optimization for Numba. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of a more application like mini-app, written in C-CUDA and Numba accelerated Python. We will evaluate if our insights from the microbenchmarks to real applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9092407/,"2020 28th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP)",11-13 March 2020,ieeexplore

First is that the chemical reaction craft needs continuous optimization and may consume lots of valuable reactants and apparatus during daily experiments. Second, the success of a designed experiment relies heavily on researchers' experience. With the starting of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, researchers are beginning to record historical reaction data, and seek new solutions via computer techniques, such as data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we study the reaction data of inorganic-organic hybrid materials from the Dark Reaction Project from Haverford College with simple machine learning algorithms (i.e., Bayes Net, SVM and C4.5), ensemble learning models (i.e., Random Forest, Stacking, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and XGBoost), and deep neural network models.

With the rapid growth in mobile network usage and video streaming being the most popular service, Quality of Experience of video in mobile networks is of extreme importance to both service providers and their customers. The ability to effectively predict Quality of Experience of video is key for QoE adaptation and higher levels of customer satisfaction. In this work machine learning algorithms were used to create models that predict QoE with network QoS parameters, including wireless-specific and 5Gspecific parameters. An 5G simulation that reflects the current mobile traffic landscape was created to obtain the data set for training. An objective tool for video QoE evaluation was used to gather QoE data necessary to train the prediction models. Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy.

However, sometimes they do result in significant costs to individuals, companies, governments and societies in the form of wasted or misdirected money, time, effort, and sometimes even in the form of lives lost. The antidote to such decisions has long been recognized to lie in algorithmic decision making.

The problem-solving tools like neural networks will dynamically perform with real-time data, but a new add-on is needed to add like big data to implement the live data. The live data can help implement and understand the importance of solving the problem like dynamic routing mechanism. There is a chance of random growth in such a field of computer science. This computational mechanism using quantum computing and the neural network will track the live operations and form the dynamic route changes in the real-time scenario. This real-time scenario worked with a 95% accuracy rate. The accuracy will differ based on the number of connecting nodes are being considered to evaluate the hidden layers of the problem-solving mechanism.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9243322/,"2020 Fourth International Conference on I-SMAC (IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) (I-SMAC)",7-9 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICTAI.2004.103,Quartet based phylogeny reconstruction with answer set programming,IEEE,Conferences,"Evolution is an important subarea of study in biological science, where given a set of species, the goal is to reconstruct their evolutionary history, or phylogeny. Many kinds of data associated with the species can be deployed for this task and many reconstruction methods have been proposed and examined in the literature. One very recent approach is to build a local phylogeny for every subset of 4 species, which is called a quartet for these 4 species, and then to assemble a phylogeny for the whole set of species satisfying these predicted quartets. In general, those predicted quartets might not always agree each other; and thus the objective function becomes to satisfy a maximum number of predicted quartets. This is the well-known maximum quartet consistency (MQC) problem, which is studied by a lot of researchers in the last two decades. We present a new equivalent representation for the MQC problem, that is, to search for an ultrametric matrix to satisfy the maximum number of those predicted quartets. We examine a few number of structural properties of the MQC problem in this new representation, through formulating it into answer set programming (ASP), a recent powerful logic programming tool for modeling and solving searching problems. The efficiency and usefulness of our approach are confirmed by our computational experiments on the artificial data as well as two real datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1374243/,16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence,15-17 Nov. 2004,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580693,Real time implementation of NARMA L2 feedback linearization and smoothed NARMA L2 controls of a single link manipulator,IEEE,Conferences,"Robotics is a field of modern technology which requires knowledge in vast areas such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science as well as finance. Nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties are unavoidable problems faced in controlling robots in industrial plants. Tracking control of a single link manipulator driven by a permanent magnet brushed DC motor is a nonlinear dynamics due to effects of gravitational force, mass of the payload, posture of the manipulator and viscous friction coefficient. Furthermore uncertainties arise because of changes of the rotor resistance with temperature and random variations of friction while operating. Due to this fact classical PID controller can not be used effectively since it is developed based on linear system theory. Neural network control schemes for manipulator control problem have been proposed by researchers; in which their competency is validated through simulation studies. On the other hand, actual real time applications are rarely established. Instead of simulation studies, this paper is aimed to implement neural network controller in real time for controlling a DC motor driven single link manipulator. The work presented in this paper is concentrating on neural NARMA L2 control and its improvement called to as Smoothed NARMA L2 control. As proposed by K. S Narendra and Mukhopadhyay, Narma L2 control is one of the popular neural network architectures for prediction and control. The real time experimentation showed that the Smoothed NARMA L2 is effective for controlling the single link manipulator for both point-to-point and continuous path motion control.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4580693/,2008 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering,13-15 May 2008,ieeexplore

The level of autonomy is improving by means of Internet-of-Things (IoT), while the level of intelligence is improving through artificial intelligence. The applications of big data analytics and cloud computing techniques in smart grids are also new topics, which have been paid particular attention recently. These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties. On the other hand, the new structures are evolving toward transactive energy trading models in microgrids. In such a circumstance, a myriad of elements is producing critical data, which should be acquired, transferred, stored, analyzed, and finally, proper controlling actions must be sent. These data are producing at different intervals, even in a fraction of a second. This matter makes it possible to maintain grid security and better real-time operation as well as to get better demand responsiveness. A smart grid consists of many embedded or interconnected systems that are linked to each other through various communication platforms in the cyber layer. A flexible, highly-autonomous, and intelligent smart grid entails an agile communication system, whether wired or wireless. However, cellular networks have prominent benefits. Hence, 5G technology, which is state-of-the-art technology in this field, can be deployed. The communication infrastructure links many components to each other in cyber-physical smart grids.

10.1109/RE.2019.00078,Specifying Requirements through Interaction Design,IEEE,Conferences,"When the requirements and the interaction design of a system are separated, they will most likely not fit together, and the resulting system will be less than optimal. Even if all the real needs are covered in the requirements and also implemented, errors may be induced by human-computer interaction through a bad interaction design and its resulting user interface. Such a system may even not be used at all. Alternatively, a great user interface of a system with features that are not required will not be very useful as well. This tutorial explains joint modeling of (communicative) interaction design and requirements, through discourse models and ontologies. Our discourse models are derived from results of human communication theories, cognitive science and sociology (even without employing speech or natural language). While these models were originally devised for capturing interaction design, it turned out that they can be also viewed as specifying classes of scenarios, i.e., use cases. In this sense, they can also be utilized for specifying requirements. Ontologies are used to define domain models and the domains of discourse for the interactions with software systems. User interfaces for these software systems can be generated semi-automatically from our discourse models, domain-of-discourse models and specifications of the requirements. This is especially useful when user interfaces for different devices are needed. Specific usability requirements can be dealt with in our approach through advanced customization approaches. Hence, inter-action design facilitates requirements engineering to make applications both more useful and usable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920541/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/FOCS.2017.98,Subdeterminant Maximization via Nonconvex Relaxations and Anti-Concentration,IEEE,Conferences,"Several fundamental problems that arise in optimization and computer science can be cast as follows: Given vectors v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>m</sub> ∈ ℝ<sup>d</sup> and a constraint family B ⊆ 2<sup>[m]</sup>, find a set S ∈ B that maximizes the squared volume of the simplex spanned by the vectors in S. A motivating example is the ubiquitous data-summarization problem in machine learning and information retrieval where one is given a collection of feature vectors that represent data such as documents or images. The volume of a collection of vectors is used as a measure of their diversity, and partition or matroid constraints over [m] are imposed in order to ensure resource or fairness constraints. Even with a simple cardinality constraint (B = (<sub>r</sub><sup>[m]</sup>)), the r problem becomes NP-hard and has received much attention starting with a result by Khachiyan [1] who gave an r<sup>O(r)</sup> approximation algorithm for this problem. Recently, Nikolov and Singh [2] presented a convex program and showed how it can be used to estimate the value of the most diverse set when there are multiple cardinality constraints (i.e., when B corresponds to a partition matroid). Their proof of the integrality gap of the convex program relied on an inequality by Gurvits [3], and was recently extended to regular matroids [4], [5]. The question of whether these estimation algorithms can be converted into the more useful approximation algorithms - that also output a set - remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to give the first approximation algorithms for both partition and regular matroids. We present novel formulations for the subdeterminant maximization problem for these matroids; this reduces them to the problem of finding a point that maximizes the absolute value of a nonconvex function over a Cartesian product of probability simplices. The technical core of our results is a new anti-concentration inequality for dependent random variables that arise from these functions which allows us to relate the optimal value of these nonconvex functions to their value at a random point. Unlike prior work on the constrained subdeterminant maximization problem, our proofs do not rely on real-stability or convexity and could be of independent interest both in algorithms and complexity where anti-concentration phenomena has recently been deployed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8104130/,2017 IEEE 58th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS),15-17 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

Although it is a fundamental step for many data science tasks, an efficient and standard framework is absent. In this paper, we study a specific synthetic data generation task called downscaling, a procedure to infer high-resolution, harder-to-collect information (e.g., individual level records) from many low-resolution, easy-to-collect sources, and propose a multi-stage framework called SynC (Synthetic Data Generation via Gaussian Copula). For given low-resolution datasets, the central idea of SynC is to fit Gaussian copula models to each of the low-resolution datasets in order to correctly capture dependencies and marginal distributions, and then sample from the fitted models to obtain the desired high-resolution subsets. Predictive models are then used to merge sampled subsets into one, and finally, sampled datasets are scaled according to low-resolution marginal constraints. We make four key contributions in this work: 1) propose a novel framework for generating individual level data from aggregated data sources by combining state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques, 2) perform simulation studies to validate SynC's performance as a synthetic data generation algorithm, 3) demonstrate its value as a feature engineering tool, as well as an alternative to data collection in situations where gathering is difficult through two real-world datasets, 4) release an easy-to-use framework implementation for reproducibility and scalability at the production level that easily incorporates new data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9346329/,2020 International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),17-20 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

However, we advocate an extended approach in which though the very cognitive informatics is the foundation, as those processes in the brain are crucial, some sort of an “outer” cognitive informatics is needed which explicitly makes reference not what proceeds “internally” in the brain, because we do not “see” this, but “externally”, i.e. what people can see, judge, evaluate, etc., and what is clearly a result of cognitive information specific processes in the brain. This line of reasoning is in line with the very essence of comprehension, memorizing, learning, choice and decision making, satisfaction with partial truth, allowing for not perfect solutions, etc. dealt with using tools and techniques derived from many areas like psychology, behavioral science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroeconomics etc. In our case, we will concentrate on some cognitive informatics type elements that mostly have been inspired by psychology and behavioral sciences, as our problem is inherently related to human judgments and perceptions, but we will mentioned some inspirations from neuroscience, notably along the lines of neuroeconomics. Cognitive informatics constitutes a foundation of its related new field, cognitive computing, which is basically a new direction in broadly perceived intelligent computing and systems that synergistically combines results from many areas, e.g., information science, computational sciences, computer science, artificial and computational intelligence, cybernetics, systems science, cognitive science, (neuro)psychology, brain science, linguistics, etc. to just mention a few. We try to show on an example of a dynamic systems modeling, more specifically scenario based regional development planning, that cognitive computing can provide new conceptual and implementation vistas. Basically, we consider a region that is characterized by 7 life quality indicators related to economic, social, environmental, etc. qualities, which evolve over some planning horizon due to some investments, mostly by some regional or governmental agencies. There are some scenarios of investment levels over the planning horizon, meant for the development of the particular life quality indexes, and some desired levels of these indexes, both objective, i.e. set by authorities, and subjective, i.e. perceived by the inhabitant groups. As a result of a particular investment scenario, the life quality indexes evolve over the planning horizon, and their temporal evolution is evaluated by the authorities and inhabitants. This evaluation has both an objective, i.e. against the “officially” set thresholds, and subjective, i.e. as perceived by various humans and their groups. Basically, we employ Kacprzyk's fuzzy dynamic programming based approach to the modeling and planning/programming of sustainable regional development, with soft constraints and goals, but we advocated a more sophisticated assessment of variability, stability, balancedness of consecutive investments. In this process we try to develop evaluation measures, and then the optimization type model using concepts that can be effectively and efficiently handled by cognitive computing, notably the inclusion of the so called decision making and behavioral biases, biases in probability and belief, social biases, memory errors, etc. Moreover, we strongly reflect the so called status quo and minimal change biases. By using many results from social sciences, psychology, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, etc. on human judgments and human centric evaluations, we augment a traditional purely effectiveness and efficiency oriented analysis by a more sophisticated analysis of effects of variability of temporal evolution of some life quality indicators on the human perception of its goodness. The model presented, which has been employed for years as part of large mathematical modeling projects for sustainable regional development in many regions in Asia and Europe, is illustrated on an example with scenario analysis for a rural region plagued by social and economic difficulties in which subsidies should properly be distributed over time to obtain a best overall socioeconomic effect. In this talk we present the model in a different perspective, based first on the basic Wang's cognitive informatics and its Wang and Ruhe's decision making application, and then based on new, more comprehensive cognitive computing. We show that this provides a novel insight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8109799/,2017 IEEE 16th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),26-28 July 2017,ieeexplore

Many scholars often suppose that stock market is the efficient market and security price fully reflects information gained by investors from stock market. But with financial anomalies emerging, many new subjects related to physics, psychology and computer science etc., are rising and forming behavioral finance, financial physics and network finance. This paper using fractal analysis method studies fractal properties of China's stock price fluctuation and arrives at a conclusion that market trend would be slightly overturned in the case of Hurst index value lower than a critical point. Then BP neural network is used for fitting the trend of China's stock price fluctuation. We construct a three-layer neural network that is applied to weight adjustment between neurons located in different layers. Experiment results show that the prediction curve of network outputs has a better fitting with the real curve of original sample data, so BP neural network in this paper has the preferable predication performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6930374/,2014 International Conference on Management Science & Engineering 21th Annual Conference Proceedings,17-19 Aug. 2014,ieeexplore

They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhDresearch is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types.

One of the active research topics in dealing with the IoT's big data is the practical feasibility of algorithms used in classical machine learning but also in a newly emerging branch, called deep learning. In this article, we demonstrate a quantitative analysis comparing performance between classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms with a human movement direction detecting application based on analog pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor signals. The sensing data acquisition and retrieval system is implemented with the open-source IoT software platforms based on the oneM2M standard. With the analog PIR data sets collected from 30 subjects, we perform experimental studies comparing classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms in terms of economic feasibility, scalability, generality, and real-time detection performance. The results show that classical machine learning shows better performance in real-time detection (i.e., with the sensing values within the first 0.5 s).

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved.

The fidelity of the model determines the quality and reliability of the decision-making; however, the intrinsic complexity of many real-world decision problems leads to significant model mismatch or infeasibility in deriving a model using the first principle. To overcome the challenges that are present in the big data era, both researchers and practitioners emphasize the importance of making decisions that are backed up by data related to decision tasks, a process called data-driven decision-making (D<sup>3</sup>M). By building on data science, not only can decision models be predicted in the presence of uncertainty or unknown dynamics, but also inherent rules or knowledge can be extracted from data and directly utilized to generate decision solutions. This position paper systematically discusses the basic concepts and prevailing techniques in data-driven decision-making and clusters-related developments in technique into two main categories: programmable data-driven decision-making (P-D<sup>3</sup>M) and nonprogrammable data-driven decision-making (NP-D<sup>3</sup>M).

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score.

10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030361,<italic>PipelineProfiler:</italic> A Visual Analytics Tool for the Exploration of AutoML Pipelines,IEEE,Journals,"In recent years, a wide variety of automated machine learning (AutoML) methods have been proposed to generate end-to-end ML pipelines. While these techniques facilitate the creation of models, given their black-box nature, the complexity of the underlying algorithms, and the large number of pipelines they derive, they are difficult for developers to debug. It is also challenging for machine learning experts to select an AutoML system that is well suited for a given problem. In this paper, we present the Pipeline Profiler, an interactive visualization tool that allows the exploration and comparison of the solution space of machine learning (ML) pipelines produced by AutoML systems. PipelineProfiler is integrated with Jupyter Notebook and can be combined with common data science tools to enable a rich set of analyses of the ML pipelines, providing users a better understanding of the algorithms that generated them as well as insights into how they can be improved. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through use cases where PipelineProfiler is used to better understand and improve a real-world AutoML system. Furthermore, we validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of a think-aloud experiment with six data scientists who develop and evaluate AutoML tools.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222086/,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,Feb. 2021,ieeexplore

In recent years, breakthroughs have been achieved in social, biological, and research cooperation networks. With the popularization of big data and deep learning technology development, graph structures are increasingly being used to represent large-scale and complex data in the real world. In this paper, we reviewed the progress made in recommendation systems research in the past 20 years and comprehensively classified recommender systems based on the heterogeneous input features. We introduced layering in the classification of recommendation systems. Furthermore, we proposed a new hierarchical classification model of recommendation systems divided into three layers: feature input, feature learning, and output layers. In the feature learning layer, existing recommendation systems were divided into graph-based, text-based, behavior-based, spatiotemporal-based, and hybrid recommendation systems. Additionally, we provided evaluation index, open-source implementation, experimental comparison and the relative merits for each recommendation method.

In conjunction with researchers from civil engineering and computer science, this article studied a fundamental problem motivated from practical IoT-based BSHM: how to effectively prolong network lifetime while guaranteeing desired coverage. Integrating a promising reinforcement learning model named learning automata (LA) with confident information coverage (CIC) model, this article presented an energy-efficient sensor scheduling strategy for partial CIC coverage in IoT-based BSHM system to guarantee network coverage and prolong network lifetime. The proposed scheme fully exploits cooperation among deployed nodes and alternatively schedules the wake/sleep status of nodes while satisfying network connectivity and partial coverage ratio. Especially, the proposed scheme takes full advantage of the LA model to adaptively learn the optimal sensor scheduling strategy and significantly extend network lifetime. A series of comparison simulations using real data sets collected by a practical BSHM system strongly verify the effectiveness and energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on how to combine the reinforcement learning mechanism with partial coverage for maximizing the network lifetime of the IoT-based BSHM.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9211720/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 March1, 2021",ieeexplore

Although numerous agent frameworks have been proposed in the vast body of literature, none of these available frameworks proved to be simple enough to be used by first-year students of computer science. Hence, the authors set out to create a novel framework that would be suitable for the aims of the course, for the level of computing skills of the intended group of students, and for the size of this group of students. The content of the introductory AI course in question is a set of assignments that requires the students to use intelligent agents and other AI techniques to monitor, filter, and retrieve relevant information from the World Wide Web. It represents, therefore, a synthesis of the traditional objectivist approach and a real-world-oriented, constructivist approach to teaching programming to novices. The main aim of implementing such a pedagogy was to engage the students in learning to which they personally relate while attaining intellectual rigor.

However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7365411/,IEEE Access,2015,ieeexplore

As there is a growing apprehension of extensible markup language (XML) as a means for data exchange in the life sciences, this article focuses on the impact of XML technology on database integration in this area. In detail, a general architecture for ontology-driven data integration based on XML technology is introduced, which overcomes some of the traditional problems in this area.

In this paper, we propose an approach for learning definitions of concepts from their examples, in the presence of numerical but also uncertain data. This approach fits in a first order logic framework and its main characteristics are: (1) the use of fuzzy sets to represent numerical data and model uncertain features, and (2) an inductive learning process based on rough set theory which is capable of handling uncertainty within the learning data. Compared to classical symbolic approaches to inductive learning, it differs in two main points: firstly, it becomes possible to represent both sharp and flexible concepts, and secondly the definitions of concepts that are learned are not deterministic but fuzzy.

It can not only help students understand the experimental principles, but also help them memorize the experimental procedures. However, there are still some problems in virtual chemistry experiments. First, in existing research, user intentions are often misunderstood and cannot be accurately understood. Second, the existing research fail to identify the user's wrong actions, which reduce the accuracy of the experiment. Third, the user sense of operation and realism is not strong during the experiment, which reduces the user's experience. Finally, the lack of navigation guidance for experimental operations increases user learning time. In order to solve these problems. This paper proposes a scheme for establishing an intelligent navigational chemical laboratory based on multimodal fusion. First of all, we design a new smart beaker structure with perceptual ability, which can be used to complete most chemical experiments and give users a real sense of experience. Besides, we propose a multimodal fusion understanding algorithm, which reduces the misidentification of the experiment and better understands the real intention of the user. Finally, intelligent navigation and wrong behavior recognition functions are added to the experimental equipment, which improves the efficiency of human-computer interaction. The results show that Compared with the existing virtual laboratory or system, the chemical laboratory scheme proposed in this paper through multimodal fusion understanding algorithm greatly reduces the user's memory load and improves the success rate of the experiment. Moreover, through the combination of virtual and real, the virtual chemistry experiment not only improves the authenticity of the operation, but also stimulates the students' interest in learning, which is well received by users.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200490/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Due to its fast scan rate and large output-data size, the current analysis of the FSCV data is often conducted on a computer external to the FSCV device. Moreover, the analysis is semi-automated and requires a good understanding of the characteristics of the underlying chemistry to interpret, making it unsuitable for real-time implementation on low-resource FSCV devices. This paper presents a hardware-software co-design approach for the analysis of FSCV data. Firstly, a deep neural network (DNN) is developed to predict the concentration of a dopamine solution and identify the data recording electrode. Secondly, the DNN is pruned to decrease its computation complexity, and a custom overlay is developed to implement the pruned DNN on a low-resource FPGA-based platform. The pruned DNN attains a recognition accuracy of 97.2% with a compression ratio of 3.18. When the DNN overlay is implemented on a PYNQ-Z2 platform, it achieves the execution time of 13 ms and power consumption of 1.479 W on the entire PYNQ-Z2 board.

For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges. First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short voltage-spikes which is disturbed by large voltage-waveforms that are simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real-time learning i.e. the simultaneous read-write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware. Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in real-time, asynchronously - avoiding non-biomimetic clocking based complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit-simulator) with MATLAB<sup>®</sup> (mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an example, the hardware shows 97.5% accuracy in classification which is equivalent to software for a Fisher's Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO<sub>2</sub> memristor.

The Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer is a novel high performance computing platform, which is ranked No. 1 among the TOP500 list in the world. In this paper, we focus on how to optimize the Portable and Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc), running on supercomputers. The main motivations for this study are twofold: (i) PETSc is widely and frequently used in many scientific research fields such as biology, fusion, artificial intelligence, geosciences, etc; and (ii) the current nuclear PETSc does not fully utilize the potential of the Sunway TaighLight system, especially its powerful processor, i.e., SW26010 processor.

The temporal and spatial limitations of human observation have motivated significant efforts to develop technology for bird song and vocalization detection and classification. While solutions based on signal processing and machine learning are extant, they are limited in various combinations of speed, computational complexity, and memory use, as well as in detection/classification capability in real-world conditions. This paper introduces ToucaNet, a deep neural network for birdsong detection based on transfer-learning, a deep learning mechanism allowing us to exploit knowledge acquired on various tasks: this enables us to speed up training and shows improved detection accuracy. ToucaNet provides birdsong detection accuracy in line with the best solutions in the literature but with much less computational complexity and memory demand.

However, microscopy cell images are easily degraded by noise during the readout procedure via optical-electronic imaging systems. Such noise degradations result in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and poor image quality for cell identification. In order to improve SNR for subsequent segmentation and image-based quantitative analysis, the commonly used state-of-art restoration techniques are applied but few of them are suitable for corrupted microscopy cell images. In this paper, we propose a multistaged method based on a novel integration of trend surface analysis, quantile-quantile plot, bootstrapping, and the Gaussian spatial kernel for the restoration of noisy microscopy cell images. We show this multistaged approach achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-art restoration techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structure similarity in synthetic noise experiments.

However, in actual experimental teaching in China, microscope samples are difficult to produce, preserve and share, and the implementation status is not ideal.

Thus, this paper constructs a smart microscope physical interaction kit for secondary school biology experiments. First, the main components of the traditional microscope are replaced by a variety of different sensing elements, which are 3D printed. Then, a novel multichannel information integration strategy based on visual, auditory and tactile information is proposed to manage different channels of information, to understand the user's operational intent and to organize reasonable interactions (including the display of real-time adjustment effects). Then, we propose a navigational interaction paradigm based on multimodal intent understanding, aiming at reminding users of invalid behavior and providing necessary operational guidance for users, thus achieving the purpose of intelligent interaction and intelligent experimental teaching.

They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship. More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks. However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation. Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation). In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification. We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network. As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training. Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC. Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329517/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2997921,A Physics-Based Neural-Network Way to Perform Seismic Full Waveform Inversion,IEEE,Journals,"Seismic full waveform inversion is a common technique that is used in the investigation of subsurface geology. Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9102272/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

In the big data era, we are facing a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale and density. Big data have volumes in range Exabyte's ten to the power of eighteen. A large number of data's are stored in Big Data storage every second. For instance in YouTube for every second a video of size 72 hours are being uploaded. It shows that big data have a big scope in handling of large data. Big data for learning, intelligence, data fusion, social network, mining and so many plays a vital role in it. The big data technologies along with machine learning algorithm have developed lots of advanced development in the field of social mining, network and social Medias. It has also developed so many challenges in data storage, handling, representation, mining, analysing the user behaviours and so many. In Social mining along with text the symbols are also analysed for effective mining of users. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. The data storage size can be optimized by using the map reduce algorithm in a effective way for data storage in big data. When the repeateddata's are replaced with its reference then the storage will be optimized.

10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381339,An Implicit Crowdsourcing Approach to Rumor Identification in Online Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"With the increasing use of online social networks as a source of news and information, the propensity for a rumor to disseminate widely and quickly poses a great concern, especially in disaster situations where users do not have enough time to fact-check posts before making the informed decision to react to a post that appears to be credible. At the same time, we know that misinformation is easily detectable by a certain few, very skeptical, or very informed users. In this study, we demonstrate how blending artificial intelligence and human skills can create a new paradigm for credibility prediction. The crowdsourcing part of the detection mechanism is implemented implicitly, by simply observing the natural interaction between users encountering the messages. Specifically, we explore the spread of information on Twitter at the microscopic (user-to-user propagation) level and propose a model that predicts if a message is True or False by observing the latent attributes of the message, along with those of the users interacting with it, and their reactions to the message. We demonstrate the application of this model to the detection of misinformation and rank the relevant message and user features that are most critical in influencing the spread of rumor over the network. Our experiments using real-world data show that the proposed model achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting the credibility of posts on Twitter, a significant boost over state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381339/,2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),7-10 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

There are lots of research to detect malware to protect mobile devices, but most of them adopt only signature-based malware detection method that can be easily bypassed by polymorphic and metamorphic malware. To detect malware and its variants, it is essential to adopt behavior-based detection for efficient malware classification. This paper presents a system that classifies malware by using common behavioral characteristics along with malware families. We measure the similarity between malware families with carefully chosen features commonly appeared in the same family. With the proposed similarity measure, we can classify malware by malware's attack behavior pattern and tactical characteristics. Also, we apply community detection algorithm to increase the modularity within each malware family network aggregation. To maintain high classification accuracy, we propose a process to derive the optimal weights of the selected features in the proposed similarity measure. During this process, we find out which features are significant for representing the similarity between malware samples. Finally, we provide an intuitive graph visualization of malware samples which is helpful to understand the distribution and likeness of the malware networks.

The existing studies have successfully explored user-item interaction via GCN for recommendation task and proved its effectiveness. We argue that a significant limitation of these methods is that social relation, which has been proven to impose positive effects for recommendation in many loss optimization models, has received relatively little scrutiny in GCN. Thus, the resultant embeddings are insufficient to model the potential social propagation effect. In our work, we propose to obtain embeddings by using the neighborhood propagation mechanism on two coupled graph neural networks, i.e., user-item interaction graph and social relation graph, which is capable of capturing the interplay between the item taste of user and user connection. In particular, to address the challenge that different factors on neighborhood propagation process make different contributions for the embedding, we develop a new social recommendation framework with hierarchical attention(i.e., neighbor-level and graph-level attention) Attentional Social Recommendation system (ASR). This allows much flexibility for adaptively acquiring relative importance for different factors. Extensive experiment on two real-world datasets not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the baselines, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of simultaneous neighborhood propagation on two graphs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9534075/,2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),18-22 July 2021,ieeexplore

In principle, the detection process seeks to simultaneously maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize the clustering drift between two successive time steps. Several evolutionary clustering methods have been developed in an attempt to find the best trade-off between clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, but the classic genetic operators in these methods do not make the best of the inter- and intra-connected relationships between nodes, which limits their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel migration operator to work in tandem with classic genetic operators to improve the discovery of evolving community structures. The operator is implemented within an existing genetic algorithm which relies on a genome representation under a decomposition framework that formulates evolutionary community detection as a multiobjective optimization problem. Moreover, we present a new method of calculating modularity directly from a genome matrix as the objective for measuring the snapshot quality, which results in a wider search space for finding the optimal solution.

Additionally, the quality of a deal depends on both the state of the vendor and decisions of other customers on Groupon. How social learning and network externality affect the decisions of customers in deal selection on Groupon is our main interest. We develop a data-driven game-theoretic framework to understand the rational deal selection behaviors cross social medias. The sufficient condition of the Nash equilibrium is identified. A value-iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal deal selection strategy. We conduct a year-long experiment to trace the competitions among deals on Groupon and the corresponding Yelp ratings. We utilize the dataset to analyze the deal selection game with realistic settings. Finally, the performance of the proposed social learning framework is evaluated with real data.

This method uses a multi-agent system, for it is based on agent interactions. With the network structure detected, we also build a model, which is based on the MAXQ algorithm, to decompose the funding policy task into subtasks and then evaluate these subtasks by using funding distribution policies from past years and looking for possible relationships between student performances and funding policies. For the experiment, we use real school data from Bexar County's 15 school districts in Texas. The first result shows that our interaction-based method is able to generate meaningful clustering and dendrograms for social networks.

Many of the challenges and ongoing (r)evolutions appear to produce as yet seemingly contradictory requirements and thus produce potentially very interesting research areas. We argue that linguistics, community-based real world “social” semantics and pragmatics, scalability, the tri-sortal nature of the communities involved, the balance between usability and reusability, and the methodological requirements for non-disruptive adoption by enterprises of the new technologies provide vectors for fundamental computer science research, for interesting new artefacts, and for new valorisations of enterprise interoperability.

Because this data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way at scale, social media has been adopted as a “passive sensor” to study human behavior. However, such research is impacted by the lack of homogeneity in the use of social media, and the engineering challenges in obtaining such data. This paper proposes a statistical framework to leverage the potential of social media in sensing studies of human behavior, while navigating the challenges associated with its sparsity. Our framework is situated in a large-scale in-situ study concerning the passive assessment of psychological constructs of 757 information workers wherein of four sensing streams was deployed - bluetooth beacons, wearable, smartphone, and social media. Our framework includes principled feature transformation and machine learning models that predict latent social media features from the other passive sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this imputation framework via a high correlation of 0.78 between actual and imputed social media features. With the imputed features we test and validate predictions on psychological constructs like personality traits and affect. We find that adding the social media data streams, in their imputed form, improves the prediction of these measures.

Since the Sanbot robot is intended to work in real environment, therefore indoor and outdoor environment is taken into account in proposing the corresponding face recognition algorithm. For each case a robust pre-processing algorithm should be designed and which can circumvent a challenging problem in face recognition, namely, different lighting conditions (light intensity, angle of radiation, etc.). In case of indoor environment, faces in an captured image by the robot HD camera are found using a Haar-cascade algorithm. Afterwards, a histogram equalization is applied to face images in order to standardize them. Then commonly practiced Deep convolutional neural network structures such as Inception and ResNet are used to design a model and trained end-to-end on a customized dataset with strong augmentation. Finally, by using a voting method, proper prediction is carried out on each face. In what concerns the outdoor environment, which has more challenges, upon applying histogram Equalization on the captured image, faces are found using a MultiTask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network. Then face images are aligned as head orientation are corrected. Finally, cropped face image is fed to Siamese Network in order to extract face features and verifying individuals. From several practical results it has been inferred that the accuracy of the indoor method is nearly 93% without voting and with voting 97%, and the outdoor method is about 95%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9260698/,2020 28th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE),4-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

The set of abilities that allow an individual to infer these hidden mental states based on observed actions and behavior has been called a ""theory of mind"". Drawing from the models of Baron-Cohen (1995) and Leslie (1994), a novel architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid robot. The implemented system determines visual saliency based on inherent object attributes, high-level task constraints, and the attentional states of others. Objects of interest are tracked in real-time to produce motion trajectories which are analyzed by a set of naive physical laws designed to discriminate animate from inanimate movement. Animate objects can be the source of attentional states (detected by finding faces and head orientation) as well as intentional states (determined by motion trajectories between objects). Individual components are evaluated by comparisons to human performance on similar tasks, and the complete system is evaluated in the context of a basic social learning mechanism that allows the robot to mimic observed movements.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1223995/,"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2003.",20-24 July 2003,ieeexplore

In this paper, inspired by the concept of “social energy”, we incorporate user experience evaluation, real-time electricity price calculation and energy consumption prediction into a unified campus-scale energy management system, to investigate the interactions among energy and social elements. The University of Denver's campus grid is used as the test bench, and energy consumption data were collected from 6 on-campus buildings to conduct the numerical experiments. Specifically, to deal with the “optimization-over-optimization” problem introduced by real-time pricing, and to tackle the high complexity problem brought by dynamic building consumption patterns, we implement neural network based iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm in this complex system to solve for the best overall system social cost.

10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.20,Link Prediction in Social Networks Using Computationally Efficient Topological Features,IEEE,Conferences,"Online social networking sites have become increasingly popular over the last few years. As a result, new interdisciplinary research directions have emerged in which social network analysis methods are applied to networks containing hundreds millions of users. Unfortunately, links between individuals may be missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or because they are not yet reflected in the online network (i.e., friends in real world did not form a virtual connection.) Existing link prediction techniques lack the scalability required for full application on a continuously growing social network which may be adding everyday users with thousands of connections. The primary bottleneck in link prediction techniques is extracting structural features required for classifying links. In this paper we propose a set of simple, easy-to-compute structural features that can be analyzed to identify missing links. We show that a machine learning classifier trained using the proposed simple structural features can successfully identify missing links even when applied to a hard problem of classifying links between individuals who have at least one common friend. A new friends measure that we developed is shown to be a good predictor for missing links and an evaluation experiment was performed on five large social networks datasets: Face book, Flickr, You Tube, Academia and The Marker. Our methods can provide social network site operators with the capability of helping users to find known, offline contacts and to discover new friends online.

Crowdsourcing can take part in many hard to compute problems such as data entry, multimedia transcriptions and many case of artificial intelligence. While this is a powerful approach, crowdsourcing needs a relatively large marketplace to works optimum. In context of Indonesia, we hardly hear about task crowdsourcing even though there are some marketplace like poin-web.co.id. In this paper, we propose a social network for crowdsourcing marketplace to penetrate the market. People tends to waste most of their time on social network and game rather than other mobile application in case of mobile usage. The idea is to make crowdsourcing as a filler while people are using social networks like waiting for a chat or scrolling the timeline. And by applying microtask as the task, people will not have much burden on doing the task. On the other hand, he/she will get additional income. We implemented LINE as a basis of our social network marketplace. LINE does provide the most interactive way of provide message. Additionally, the user of LINE in Indonesia is growing in a fast pace. We conduct an experiment focused on worker's coverage and ease of use.

Organizations not only have to update their software to the latest versions, but do effective patch management and prioritize security-related patching as well. In addition to intelligence sources such as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) alerts, cybersecurity news, national vulnerability database (NBD), and commercial cybersecurity vendors, social media is another valuable source that facilitates early stage intelligence gathering. To early detect future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, we propose a dynamic vulnerability-threat assessment model to predict the tendency to be exploited for vulnerability entries listed in Common Vulnerability Exposures, and also to analyze social media contents such as Twitter to extract meaningful information. The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet.

The person social relation extraction is one of the most important fields in relation extraction. A large number of techniques have been proposed on relation extraction thus far, and supervised machine learning methods are the most widely used. However, the disadvantages of supervised machine learning methods are that manually annotating training data set is costly and time-consuming, which block the improvement of the supervised relation extraction model. Aiming at the limitation, we propose a novel person social relation extraction model on both Chinese and English corpus with distant supervision. Distant supervision method can make full use of the information in the knowledge base and provide training data without manual effort. In particular, it is an effective method in the very large corpora which contains thousands of relations. In this model, we use distant supervision method to get the weak-labeled data set. Then, a supervised method is used to train a classifier, which is expect to distinguish the relation between the person entities in the input sentence.

Emergency response is one such area that stands to gain from these advances. By processing billions of texts and images a minute, events can be automatically detected to enable emergency response workers to better assess rapidly evolving situations and deploy resources accordingly. To date, most event detection techniques in this area have focused on image-only or text-only approaches, limiting detection performance and impacting the quality of information delivered to crisis response teams. In this paper, we present a new multimodal fusion method that leverages both images and texts as input. In particular, we introduce a cross-attention module that can filter uninformative and misleading components from weak modalities on a sample by sample basis. In addition, we employ a multimodal graph-based approach to stochastically transition between embeddings of different multimodal pairs during training to better regularize the learning process as well as dealing with limited training data by constructing new matched pairs from different samples.

Although the acknowledgment that social learning is related to travel decision is promoted, quantitative analysis about how social learning shape and impact the decision of passengers is still limited. We study and estimate a diffusion probability between different passengers by proposing a CCM (Co-travel Link Cascade Model) based on a modified EM iterative algorithm. Then, we segment passengers into three types (Influenced, Unchecked and Immune). The three types of passengers are predicated by approaches of IC-like model, Random Forest model and probabilistic model, respectively.

Whilst artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing to produce more concise and interesting crowd behaviours, the number or sophistication of the algorithms implemented within a system does not necessarily guarantee its perceptual realism. Human perception is highly subjective and does not always conform to the reality of the situation. Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic.

10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00024,SRaSLR: A Novel Social Relation Aware Service Label Recommendation Model,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rapid development of new technologies such as cloud, edge and mobile computing, the number and diversity of available services are dramatically exploding and services have become increasingly important to people's daily work and life. As a consequence, using service label recommendation techniques to automatically categorize services plays a crucial role in many service computing tasks, such as service discovery, service composition, and service organization. There have been many service label recommendation studies that have achieved remarkable performance. However, these studies mainly focus on using the text information in service profiles to recommend labels for services while overlooking those social relations that widely exist among services. We argue that such social relations can help to obtain more precise recommendation results. In this paper, we propose a novel Social Relation aware Service Label Recommendation model called SRaSLR, which combines text information in service profiles and social network relations among services. A deep learning based model is constructed based on feature fusion of the two perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Programmable Web dataset, and the experiment results show that SRaSLR yields better performance than existing methods. Additionally, we discuss how service social network affects service label recommendation performance based on the experiment results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9590240/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS),5-10 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/ASONAM.2012.66,Semi-Supervised Policy Recommendation for Online Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Fine grain policy settings in social network sites is becoming a very important requirement for managing user's privacy. Incorrect privacy policy settings can easily lead to leaks in private and personal information. At the same time, being too restrictive would reduce the benefits of online social networks. This is further complicated with the growing adoption of social networks and with the rapid growth in information uploading and sharing. The problem of facilitating policy settings has attracted numerous access control, and human computer interaction researchers. The solutions proposed range from usable interfaces for policy settings to automated policy settings. We propose a fine grained policy recommendation system that is based on an iterative semi-supervised learning approach that uses the social graph propagation properties. Active learning and social graph properties were used to detect the most informative instances to be labeled as training sets. We implemented and tested our approach using real Facebook dataset.

Many tobacco users discuss their opinions, habits and preferences on social media. This work conceptualizes a framework for targeted health interventions to inform tobacco users about the consequences of tobacco use. We designed a Twitter bot named Notobot (short for No-Tobacco Bot) that leverages machine learning to identify users posting pro-tobacco tweets and select individualized interventions to curb their tobacco use. We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets manually labeled as either pro-tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieved a 90% accuracy rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting protobacco tweets were matched with former smokers with similar interests who posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, leveraging the power of peer influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers.

Numerous posts are also posted about various brands belonging to multiple domains like technology, sports, fashion, etc. These posts, when analysed, can provide valuable insights about the social media users' opinion and prove to be an untapped gold mine for the brands. These insights can in turn help the brands to make better business decisions based on the insights that are extracted from the posts. This paper aims to provide a real-time solution to stream the tweets from Twitter related to a specific brand and analyse them in real-time in order to extract insights from the tweet data that allows the brands to know what exactly are the social media users' perceptions about them. This solution consists of multiple stages where scripts are deployed on servers and run around the clock to process the raw streamed tweet data using artificial intelligence techniques in order to extract location, sentiments, named entities, date and time to further categorise the information based on numerous factors mentioned in the paper and present the data in the form of charts displayed on a webpage which will enable the end user to gain insights and uncover hidden patterns from the data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9579699/,2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT),6-8 July 2021,ieeexplore

As a matter of fact, social networks are increasingly considered to understand the opinion trend about a politician or related to a certain event that occurred: in general social networks have been proved useful to understand the public opinion from both governments and companies. In addition, also from the end users point of view it is difficult to identify real contents. This is the reason why in last years we are witnessing a growing interest in tools for analyzing big data gathered from social networks in order to find common opinions. In this context, content polluters on social networks make the opinion mining process difficult to browse valuable contents. In this paper we propose a method aimed to discriminate between pollute and real information from a semantic point of view.

10.1109/IACC.2016.111,Sybil Detection in Online Social Networks (OSNs),IEEE,Conferences,"Peer to peer and distributed systems are generally susceptible to sybil attacks. Online social networks (OSNs), due to their fat user base and open access nature are also prone to such attacks. Current state-of-art algorithms for sybil attack detection make use of the inherent social graph created among registered users of OSN service. They rely on the inherent trust relationship among these users. No effort is made to combine other characteristic behavior of sybil users with properties of social graph of OSNs to improve detection accuracy of sybil attacks. Sybil identities are also used as gateways for spreading spam content in OSNs. The proposed approach exploits this behavior of sybil users to improve detection accuracy of existing sybil detection algorithms. In the proposed approach, content generated/published by each user is used along with the topological properties of the social graph of registered users. A machine learning model is used for assigning a fractional value called ""trust value"" which denotes the amount of legitimate content generated by the user. A modification to sybil detection algorithm is proposed which makes use of the trust value of each user to improve the accuracy of detecting a sybil identity. Real dataset from Facebook is crawled and used for analysis and experiments. Analytical results show the superiority of proposed solution. Results are compared with SybilGuard and SybilShield which shows ~14% decrease in false positive rates with very minimal effect on acceptance rate or false negative rate of the sybil detection algorithms.

10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057066,SybilSCAR: Sybil detection in online social networks via local rule based propagation,IEEE,Conferences,"Detecting Sybils in online social networks (OSNs) is a fundamental security research problem as adversaries can leverage Sybils to perform various malicious activities. Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into two categories: Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and they cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a new structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in OSNs. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with a state-of-the-art RW-based method and a state-of-the-art LBP-based method, using both synthetic Sybils and large-scale social network datasets with real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that SybilSCAR is more accurate and more robust to label noise than the compared state-of-the-art RW-based method, and that SybilSCAR is orders of magnitude more scalable than the state-of-the-art LBP-based method and is guaranteed to converge.

10.1109/TAMD.2011.2112766,A Biologically Inspired Architecture for an Autonomous and Social Robot,IEEE,Journals,"Lately, lots of effort has been put into the construction of robots able to live among humans. This fact has favored the development of personal or social robots, which are expected to behave in a natural way. This implies that these robots could meet certain requirements, for example, to be able to decide their own actions (autonomy), to be able to make deliberative plans (reasoning), or to be able to have an emotional behavior in order to facilitate human-robot interaction. In this paper, the authors present a bioinspired control architecture for an autonomous and social robot, which tries to accomplish some of these features. In order to develop this new architecture, authors have used as a base a prior hybrid control architecture (AD) that is also biologically inspired. Nevertheless, in the later, the task to be accomplished at each moment is determined by a fix sequence processed by the Main Sequencer. Therefore, the main sequencer of the architecture coordinates the previously programmed sequence of skills that must be executed. In the new architecture, the main sequencer is substituted by a decision making system based on drives, motivations, emotions, and self-learning, which decides the proper action at every moment according to robot's state. Consequently, the robot improves its autonomy since the added decision making system will determine the goal and consequently the skills to be executed.

Therefore, this research addresses this overlooked need and proposes a trust model for the teen community, which can evaluate the trustworthiness of a stranger based on teens' psychological and social needs. This paper first identifies various factors of teen psychology from literature, and then proposes a trust model for teens based on those factors. The model ensures the trustworthiness of a stranger through a two-dimension matrix consists of his reputation in other teens and reliability. The proposed model was simulated through colored Petri nets and implemented as a real-time trust evaluation application over Facebook. A user acceptance testing was also performed by teens, which suggests that 81.77% of teens were overall satisfied with the proposed approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133402/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Fortunately, there is a lot of information that we can use. We can make recommendations by mining the rich information hidden in user check-in records. In this paper, we propose a recommend system named GFP-LORE. Specifically, we have designed a framework, which integrates various influencing factors. First, we modeled friend sign-in frequencies and POI popularity as a power-law distribution and the experiment proved that it is effective. Then, we got the influence of geographic information by modeling it according to the longitude and latitude of the user's check-in location. After that, we sorted the historical check-in records of all users according to time and then mine an overall pattern of location transfer-order pattern. Then, we combine it with each user's own unique location transfer record to get the possibility of the user going to the next POI. Finally, we synthesize the above four influence factors into a unified correlation probability rating and recommend a new location by this probability rating. We tested our system on the open real check-in data set, and the results of our simulation experiments show that the recommendation effect of our system is better than those algorithms used in the contrast test.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8764552/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Since the number and size of the networks modeled by graphs grow larger and larger, some level of parallelism needs to be used, to reduce the computational costs of such massive applications. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (referred to as lists on Facebook and Twitter), while users, based on their interests, place themselves into groups of interest. However, the community detection and is a very effortful procedure, and in addition, these communities need to be updated very often, resulting in more effort. In this paper, we combine parallel processing techniques with a typical data structure like threaded binary trees to detect communities in an efficient manner. Our strategy is implemented over weighted networks with irregular topologies and it is based on a stepwise path detection strategy, where each step finds a link that increases the overall strength of the path being detected.

Due to the limited length of each short text, word co-occurrence information in this type of documents is sparse. Conventional topic models based on word co-occurrence are unable to distill coherent topics on short texts. A state-of-the-art strategy is self-aggregated topic models which implicitly aggregate short texts into latent long documents. But these models have two problems. One problem is that the number of long documents should be defined explicitly and the inappropriate number leads to poor performance. Another problem is that latent long documents may bring non-semantic word co-occurrence which brings incoherent topics. In this article, we firstly apply the Chinese restaurant process to automatically generate the number of long documents according to the scale of short texts. Then to exclude non-semantic word co-occurrence, we propose a novel probabilistic model generating latent long documents in a more semantically way. Specifically, our model employs a pitman-yor process to aggregate short texts into long documents. This stochastic process can guarantee that the distribution between short texts and long documents following a power-law distribution which can be found in social media like Twitter.

On the other hand, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a favorable way to locally process SIoT data for reducing data transmission and computation among SIoT devices and backhaul networks. Nevertheless, the load sharing among SIoT devices, MEC, and remote servers brings about new challenges for the communication and computation tradeoff, cross-layer design in SIoT, and forwarding and aggregation tradeoff. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, SIoT collaborative group and device selection problem (SCGDSP), and prove the NP-hardness. We first explore the intrinsic properties of a fundamental SCGDSP case by finding the optimal collaborative group for each user request. Then, we design an approximation algorithm for the general SCGDSP that first evaluates candidate collaborative groups under different social relations, and then selects the collaborative groups and SIoT devices properly. For scalability, the proposed algorithm also supports dynamic user requests and can be distributionally deployed in massive networks enabling collaborative MEC. Moreover, it also sustains local SIoT services, where the computation only involves SIoT devices and MEC servers. Simulation results demonstrate that effective SIoT and collaborative group selection (ESCGS) can reduce by more than 50% of the total communication and computation costs compared with baseline schemes in the real networks from topology zoo. Moreover, the distributed ESCGS reduces by 87% of the running time with total 16.5-MB message overhead, requiring no more than 0.05-ms transmission delay in a 100-Gb/s backbone network with eight MEC servers, 1000 SIoTs, and 800 monitored locations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9171854/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the final network achieves above 97% testing accuracy and outperforms other relevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine messages posted daily.

Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdös-Rényi random network and the Barabási-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large. To verify our theoretical analysis, we perform simulations for the information diffusion over synthetic networks and real-world Facebook networks.

Unfortunately, the hidden information is likely to be predicted by various powerful inference attacks with the rapid advances in machine learning. Then, what is the risk that a user's private information could be disclosed? What countermeasures can be taken to fight against the privacy violation for the user? To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk.

On one hand, platforms such as Twitter have taken a central role in the dissemination and consumption of news. On the other hand, news editors rely on social media for following their audience's attention and for crowd-sourcing news stories. Twitter hashtags function as a key connection between Twitter crowds and the news media, by naturally naming and contextualizing stories, grouping the discussion of news and marking topic trends. In this work, we propose Hashtagger+, an efficient learning-to-rank framework for merging news and social streams in real-time, by recommending Twitter hashtags to news articles. We provide an extensive study of different approaches for streaming hashtag recommendation, and show that pointwise learning-to-rank is more effective than multi-class classification as well as more complex learning-to-rank approaches.

Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time.

Therefore, in this paper, we conducted an experiment to study users' gender identity through a mobile social network. Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth, that is, one's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither. In general, a person's psychological gender cannot be observed from the external characteristics of people. And even if some user's attributes such as physical gender and age can be found in social networks, it is difficult to find out the psychological gender of users. Apart from the fact that it will be hidden as the user's privacy, the main reason is that users' behaviors in social networks have no direct relationship with psychological gender. In this paper, we choose a special mobile social network to get around these limitations. Specifically, this paper is based on a real-world large gay social network of more than 10 000 000 users. In this mobile social network, we can indirectly mark the psychological gender of users by their sexual orientation. We collect 1000 users, including their characters, followers, followees and the same data for their followers and followees. Then, we examine an extensive set of features that can be extracted from the data set and train some classifiers to automatically identify the user's psychological gender. In the special mobile social network, a user's psychological gender is related to his characteristics, which include his personal characteristics, dating preference, and so on. This paper mainly analyzes users' personal characteristics, triads, and triadic evolution to infer their psychological gender. The experiments show that all these features are indeed effective in the classification, and even the features considered in previous studies have different implications with gender identity on other social networks. And it turns out that psychological gender as a kind of privacy can be leaked by these unintentional behaviors, and so we give some practical suggestions at the end of this paper to protect users' privacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8611321/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Diverse kinds of trajectories from the sensor networks provide an unprecedented opportunity for intelligence analysis. The geographic co-movement pattern has rarely been used by the police force to infer social connections, although it has been prevalent in other fields. The previous studies have mainly focused on a singular form of trajectories with exact co-locations, and the spread of the co-locations is over-looked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting co-occurrence patterns over multiplex trajectories. Firstly, We constructed the foundation for the discovery of co-occurrence events, namely space-time resonance honeycomb. It consists of multiple polygonal zones over sensor networks. Secondly, we transform all trajectories into a series of space-time prisms, and co-location activities are recorded using a sliding window approach. Thirdly, we propose a novel feature: Geo-Spread, which captures the extent of the co-location spread. In the end, we combine multiple features and employ Random Forest to predict social connections. We conduct extensive experiments on both the public dataset and the real-world surveillance dataset.

10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2192107,Robust Multiperson Detection and Tracking for Mobile Service and Social Robots,IEEE,Journals,"This paper proposes an efficient system which integrates multiple vision models for robust multiperson detection and tracking for mobile service and social robots in public environments. The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm which combines the multimodel detections in mean-shift tracking. First, a likelihood probability which integrates detections and similarity to local appearance is defined. Then, an expectation-maximization (EM)-like mean-shift algorithm is derived under the ML framework. In each iteration, the E-step estimates the associations to the detections, and the M-step locates the new position according to the ML criterion. To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for multiperson tracking, an improved sequential strategy to perform the mean-shift tracking is proposed. Under this strategy, human objects are tracked sequentially according to their priority order. To balance the efficiency and robustness for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is selected. The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social robots. The vision system integrates stereo-based and histograms-of-oriented-gradients-based human detections, occlusion reasoning, and sequential mean-shift tracking. Various examples to show the advantages and robustness of the proposed system for multiperson tracking from mobile robots are presented. Quantitative evaluations on the performance of multiperson tracking are also performed. Experimental results indicate that significant improvements have been achieved by using the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6187748/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)",Oct. 2012,ieeexplore

However, the temporal variation in the topology of social networks and the ongoing dynamic processes challenge our traditional source identification techniques that are considered in static networks. In this paper, we borrow an idea from criminology and propose a novel method to overcome the challenges. First, we reduce the time-varying networks to a series of static networks by introducing a time-integrating window. Second, instead of inspecting every individual in traditional techniques, we adopt a reverse dissemination strategy to specify a set of suspects of the real rumor source. This process addresses the scalability issue of source identification problems, and therefore dramatically promotes the efficiency of rumor source identification. Third, to determine the real source from the suspects, we employ a novel microscopic rumor spreading model to calculate the maximum likelihood (ML) for each suspect. The one who can provide the largest ML estimate is considered as the real source. The evaluations are carried out on real social networks with time-varying topology. The experiment results show that our method can reduce 60 - 90 percent of the source seeking area in various time-varying social networks. The results further indicate that our method can accurately identify the real source, or an individual who is very close to the real source. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first that can be used to identify rumor sources in time-varying social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7393814/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 Jan.-Feb. 2018,ieeexplore

The platform is the result of a codesign effort between computing and social scientists, iteratively developed through a series of pilot studies. The platform is founded upon a knowledge-based approach, in which input streams (channels) are characterized by spatial and terminological parameters, collected media is preprocessed to identify significant terms (signals), and data are tagged (framed) in relation to an ontology. Interpretation of processed media is framed in terms of the 5W framework (who, what, when, where, and why). The platform is designed to be open to the incorporation of new processing modules, building on the knowledge-based elements (channels, signals, and framing ontology) and accessible via a set of user-facing apps. We present the conceptual architecture for the platform, discuss the design and implementation challenges of the underlying stream-processing system, and present a number of apps developed in the context of the pilot studies, highlighting the strengths and importance of the codesign approach and indicating promising areas for future research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8232468/,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,March 2018,ieeexplore

Recent approaches simultaneously explore visual, user and tag information to improve the performance of image retagging by mining the tag-image-user associations. However, such methods will become computationally infeasible with the rapidly increasing number of images, tags and users. It has been proven that the anchor graph can significantly accelerate large-scale graph-based learning by exploring only a small number of anchor points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularized Tensor Completion (SUGAR-TC) method to efficiently refine the tags of social images, which is insensitive to the scale of data. First, we construct an anchor-unit graph across multiple domains (e.g., image and user domains) rather than traditional anchor graph in a single domain. Second, a tensor completion based on Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularization (SUGAR) is implemented to refine the tags of the anchor images. Finally, we efficiently assign tags to non-anchor images by leveraging the relationship between the non-anchor units and the anchor units.

By analyzing network structure, we find that friendship in online social networks can better describe self-report friendship compared to friendship created by frequent physical encounters. Several supervised classifiers with the combination of features extracted from mobile trace data and online social data are used to predict the self-report social relationship under different social strengths. Results show that the proposed model can correctly predict more than 80% friends under strongest social tie strength.

It brings the real challenge to distinguish that what particular information is credible. Especially when user authenticity is hidden, due to the microblog’s anonymity feature. Low credibility content creates an imbalance in society. Therefore many research studies are conducted to assess automatic microblog’s credibility but the majority of them offer different concepts of credibility and the problem seems unresolved. Credibility is multi-disciplinary, hence there is no generalized or accepted credibility concept with all its necessary and detailed constructs/components. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the complete anatomy of information credibility from different disciplines. It is accomplished here through an in-depth and organized study of all the problem dimensions for the identification of comprehensive and necessary credibility constructs. The framework is also proposed based on the identified constructs. It adheres to these constructs and presents their inter-relationships. It is believed that the framework would provide the necessary building blocks for implementing an effective automatic credibility assessment system. The framework is generic to social media and specifically implemented for microblogs. It is completely transformed up to features level, in the context of microblogs. Regarding automatic credibility assessment, it is proposed after detailed analysis that the attempt should be made for hybrid models combining feature-based and graph-based approaches. It is observed that quite a few surveys in the literature focus on some limited aspects of microblogs credibility but no literature survey and fundamental study exists that consolidates the work done. To understand the broader domain of credibility and consolidate the work in this area that can lead us to a suitable framework, we explored the existing literature from different disciplines for the said objectives.

10.1109/TSMC.2018.2854000,Social Recommendation With Evolutionary Opinion Dynamics,IEEE,Journals,"When users in online social networks make a decision, they are often affected by their neighbors. Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models. Our method is quite general, and indicates that studies in social physics, statistics, and other research fields may be involved in recommendation to improve the performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419088/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/TASE.2017.2731371,Toward Socially Aware Robot Navigation in Dynamic and Crowded Environments: A Proactive Social Motion Model,IEEE,Journals,"Safe and social navigation is the key to deploying a mobile service robot in a human-centered environment. Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts. Last but not least, we will investigate different machine learning techniques and incorporate them in the PSMM in order to allow the robot to automatically adapt to diverse social environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8011466/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

In this paper, a new type of network community in online social networks (OSNs) is identified using the association between network nodes. This new network community is called “virtual community.” Virtual communities are based on either the real/ physical relationships of users that are connected to their constituency, social, and professional activities or their virtual interactions associated with their cognitive levels, choice selection, and ideology. Users belonging to the same virtual community exhibit similar behavior in linking to nodes of common interest. These nodes, which reflect the common interest of a community, are called “prime nodes.” Prime nodes are linked to the prediction problem in OSN completion and are generally recommended for OSN growth. Recent studies on ranking algorithms have shown that the incompleteness of OSNs contributes to the low accuracy of ranking algorithms in identifying top spreaders. Thus, in this paper, we propose an OSN completion method based on link prediction through association between prime nodes. An experiment on predicting new links in two real big data sets of two global OSNs, namely, Facebook and Twitter, is conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated by applying prominent ranking algorithms to the newly predicted and original networks.

10.1109/ICTAI.2018.00138,A Graph Resilience Metric Based On Paths: Higher Order Analytics With GPU,IEEE,Conferences,"Structural resilience is an inherent, paramount property of real world, massive, scale free graphs such as those typically encountered in brain networks, protein-to-protein interaction diagrams, logistics and supply chains, as well as social media among others. This means that in case a small fraction of edges or even vertices with their incident edges are deleted, then alternative, although possibly longer, paths can be found such that the overall graph connectivity remains intact. This durability, which is constantly exhibited in nature, can be attributed to three main reasons. First, almost by construction, scale free graphs have a relatively high density. Moreover, they have a short diameter or at least an effective diameter. Finally, scale free graphs are recursively built on communities. As a consequence, the effect of a few edge or even vertex deletions inside a community remains isolated there as a rule and the effects of deletion are thus negated. Ultimately these properties stem from the degree distribution. In this conference paper is proposed a new, generic, and scalable graph resilience metric which relies on the weighted sum of the number of paths crossing certain vertices of great communication and structural value.

Despite these advances, real-time detection of such speech, while it is being shared on these platforms, remains a challenge for two reasons. First, these approaches train complex models on a plethora of features, which calls into question their computational efficiency for real-time deployment. Moreover, they require sizeable, manually annotated data sets from the same context, and annotating large data sets is extremely time-consuming, error-prone and cumbersome. This paper proposes a parsimonious and practical approach for the detection of offensive speech that alleviates these challenges. The approach is parsimonious because through a comprehensive evaluation of commonly used machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) on two public domain data sets it demonstrates that a simple Logistic Regression model trained on unigrams with frequency counts can detect hate speech with high accuracy of over 90%. It is practical because it demonstrates how an existing labeled training data set can be used to train models that can detect offensive content from a completely unknown data set with moderate accuracy.

In this paper, we aim to supplement one aspect of autonomous robots by giving robotic systems the ability to ""read the room"" to assess how their humorous statements are received by nearby people in real time. Using a dataset of the audio of crowd responses to a robotic comedian over multiple performances (first presented in past work), we establish human-labeled joke success ground truths and compare individual human rater accuracy against the outputs of lightweight Machine Learning (ML) approaches that are easy to deploy in real-time joke assessment. Our results indicate that all three ML approaches (naïve Bayes, support vector machines, and single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks) performed significantly better than the baseline approach used in our past work. In particular, support vector machines and neural network approaches are comparable to a human rater in the task of assessing if a joke failed or not in certain cases. The products of this work will inform self-assessment techniques for robots and help social robotics researchers test their own assessment methods on realistic data from human crowds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9561941/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),30 May-5 June 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207586,A Semantic Subgraphs Based Link Prediction Method for Heterogeneous Social Networks with Graph Attention Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Link prediction is a very important research issue in social networks analysis, and it has a very wide range of applications. Real world social networks are usually heterogeneous networks which contain rich semantic information. Meta-paths are often used to characterize this semantic information in the analysis of heterogeneous social networks. Existing methods either use only topology information or use only a single meta path to extract semantic information in the network. In this paper, we propose a link prediction method based on SEmantic Subgraphs and Graph ATtention network (SESGAT). SESGAT not only makes full use of the different semantic information contained in different semantic subgraphs, but also uses the attention mechanism to learn the different importance of different semantic subgraphs for link prediction.

10.1109/SocialCom.2013.116,A Serious Game Based on a Public Goods Experiment,IEEE,Conferences,"It has been pointed that public goods games lack experimental research in topics such as the study of the interaction of groups versus the interaction of individuals and effects of social identity and decision framing. Furthermore, the number of computational frameworks proposed to date to deploy these type of experiments is reduced. In this context, we propose the INVITE computational framework to serve as a useful research tool. The motivation behind the proposed framework is therefore straightforward: to allow researchers to be able to configure without difficulty public goods experiments where they can test their hypothesis regarding the behaviour of individuals, simulate behaviour of automated artificial intelligence and study the interaction between virtual agents and real persons. The greatest advantage of the INVITE framework is that it provides a high level of flexibility in the configuration of game theoretical paradigms. It is possible to configure simple structures such as the 2-player prisoner's dilemma or stag hunt as well as some of the most complex forms of inter-group conflicts such as team games. Accordingly, this framework allows an effortless parametrization, assisted by a tailored configuration tool, of a myriad of public goods games. Moreover, the 3D video game configured in the framework places the players in an immersive and engaging virtual environment where real-life conditions can be replicated and some circumstances, difficult to reproduce in real-life, such as life-threatening situations, can also be simulated. Given its characteristics, the proposed framework aims to represent an important contribution to the study of behaviour of both virtual and human players in scenarios of social conflict.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6693413/,2013 International Conference on Social Computing,8-14 Sept. 2013,ieeexplore

In this paper, a social bots detection model based on deep learning algorithm (DeBD) is proposed. The model mainly includes three layers. The first layer is the joint content feature extraction layer, which focuses on the feature extraction of the tweets content and the relationship between them. The second layer is the tweet metadata temporal feature extraction layer, which regards the tweet metadata as temporal information and uses this temporal information as the input of the LSTM to extract the user social activity temporal feature. The third layer is the feature fusing layer, which fuses the extracted joint content features with the temporal features to detect social bots.

However, analyzing huge amount of data manually is not possible in time context of business. Therefore, automated sentimental analysis, which can automatically determine the sentiments from the text data corpus plays an important role in today's world. Many sentimental analysis frameworks with state of the art results have been proposed in the literature. However, many of these frameworks have low accuracy on the textual data corpus contains emoticons and special texts. In addition, many of these frameworks are also energy and computation intensive with which puts limitation in their real time deployment. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by proposing a novel sentimental analysis framework based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed framework uses a novel technique to tokenize the text documents, wherein stop words, special characters, emoticons present in the text documents are eliminated. In addition, words with similar meanings and annotations are clubbed together into one type, using the concept of stemming. The pre-processed tokenized documents are then vectorized into n-gram integers vectors using the `TfidfVectorizer' for use as input to the SVM based machine learning classifier model.

The football setting provides rich interaction possibilities and a ready source of competition in an environment containing both predictable and non-deterministic elements. Successful players must be able to react quickly in real time, exhibit multiple competences and choose between several possibly conflicting goals. Opportunities exist to explore reflexive behaviour, strategic behaviour and even communication and social behaviour in team events. At the same time, artificial neural networks are increasingly being used in robot controllers to explore new biologically-inspired ideas relating to perception, memory and motor control. The research described in this paper attempts to combine these two areas of study to produce a framework for a neurally based and visually guided football-playing controller. A controller architecture is proposed in which a small set of high-level features in the robot's environment are extracted from raw image data by using a feedforward neural network. These feature signals, collectively termed the ""feature bus"", are then available for use by other controller modules.

In this article, we propone a three (03) step approach for the detection and analysis of phishing on Twitter, which can be applied to several other social networks. The first step is to browse a database called “Blacklist” in search of the suspicious URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Subsequently, we proceed to URL (Uniform Resource Locator) analysis leveraging machine learning techniques introducing new features. In this step the three following classifiers were used namely, Regression Logistics, SVM (Support vector Machine) and Random Forest.

Gauging population sentiment for targeted response areas and having the ability to predict or control sentiment within these areas is invaluable. Review of reception towards deployed forces must be analyzed, especially in areas vital for U.S. national interests. Predicting population behavior is critical for success and must include a qualitative as well as a quantitative solution. Additionally, a feedback mechanism is needed for periodically updating reception towards presence of U.S. Forces over time. We propose a method for predicting sentiment towards deployed U.S. Forces in near real time, to efficiently propitiate manpower resources, allocate equipment assets, and reduce cost of analyses. Sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly important and feasible task based on social media, open source data, physical imagery and abundance of video data feeds. Predicting reaction to events can be time consuming. Locating the most likely affected areas is very tedious, requiring much human labor effort, and it is often difficult to obtain the best information on a timely basis. An efficient tool would be helpful to rapidly parse text that has been extracted from an intelligent algorithm in order to evaluate the population sentiment for the targeted area.

Here, we specially studied the impact the interfaces have on the quality of the learning examples and the usability. We showed that providing non-expert users with a feedback of what the robot is perceiving is needed if one is interested in robust interaction. In particular, the iPhone interface allowed non-expert users to provide better learning examples due to its whole visual feedback. Furthermore, we also studied the user's gaming experience and found that in spite of its lower usability, the gestures interface was stated as entertaining as the other interfaces and increases the user's feeling of cooperating with the robot.

10.1109/FCCM.2017.58,Accelerating Large-Scale Graph Analytics with FPGA and HMC,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph analytics that explores the relationship among interconnected entities is becoming increasingly important due to its broad applicability from machine learning to social science. However, one major challenge for graph processing systems is the irregular data access pattern of graph computation which can significantly degrade the performance. The algorithms, software, and hardware that have been tailored for mainstream parallel applications are, as a result, generally not effective for massive-scale sparse graphs from the real world due to their complexity and irregularity. To address the performance issues in large-scale graph analytics, we combine the emerging Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) with a modern FPGA in order to achieve exceptional random access performance without any loss of flexibility or efficiency in computation. In particular, we develop collaborative software/hardware techniques to perform a level-synchronized breadth first search (BFS) on the FPGA-HMC platform. From the software perspective, we develop an architecture-aware graph clustering algorithm that fully exploits the platform's capability to improve data locality and memory access efficiency. For each input graph, this algorithm provides an efficient data layout that allows the FPGA to coalesce memory requests into the largest possible HMC payload requests so that the number of memory requests, which is the primary factor in runtime, can be minimized. From the hardware perspective, we further improve the FPGA-HMC graph processor architecture by adding a merging unit. The merging unit takes the best advantage of the increased data locality resulting from graph clustering. We evaluated the performance of our BFS implementation using the AC-510 development kit from Micron over a set of benchmarks from a wide range of applications. We observed that the combination of the clustering algorithm and the merging hardware achieved 2.8 × average performance improvement compared to the latest FPGA-HMC based graph processing system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966655/,2017 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM),30 April-2 May 2017,ieeexplore

A basic and crucial point for any energy company is how much energy to buy. That is, determining the amount of energy to be purchased as close as possible to that needed to serve its customers, avoiding financial losses by consuming more or less than they have. However, this is not a trivial problem, as energy consumption depends on several exogenous and endogenous factors, such as all the problems previously mentioned, in addition to economic, social, climatic, political and cultural aspects, among others. Thus, energy forecasts are realized with aid of both statistical analyzes and computational techniques. This article exposes a very short and short term energy forecast model using Neural Networks and feedback, applied in the new global context: the new coronavirus pandemic and its implications for energy consumption. The method was implemented with a real consumption dataset provided by the Brazilian energy company Equatorial from Para State and from Maranhao State. Very short term energy forecasts results reached a MAPE of around 1.2% in a 15-day window for both States, Para and Maranhao.

The crux of this increasing dependence on the internet is the rise of different kinds of cyberattacks on unsuspecting users. One such attack is phishing, which aims at stealing user information via deceptive websites. The primary defense against phishing consists of maintaining a black list of the phishing URLs. However, a black list approach is reactive and cannot defend against new phishing websites. For this reason, a number of research have been done on using machine learning techniques to detect previously unseen phishing URLs. While they show promising results, any such implementation is yet to be seen. This is because 1) little work has been done on developing a complete end-to-end framework for phishing URL detection 2) it is prohibitively slow to detect phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms. In this work we address these two issues by formulating a robust framework for fast and automated detection of phishing URLs. We have validated our framework with a real dataset achieving 87% accuracy in a real-time setup.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031269/,2020 10th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),6-8 Jan. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381339,An Implicit Crowdsourcing Approach to Rumor Identification in Online Social Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"With the increasing use of online social networks as a source of news and information, the propensity for a rumor to disseminate widely and quickly poses a great concern, especially in disaster situations where users do not have enough time to fact-check posts before making the informed decision to react to a post that appears to be credible. At the same time, we know that misinformation is easily detectable by a certain few, very skeptical, or very informed users. In this study, we demonstrate how blending artificial intelligence and human skills can create a new paradigm for credibility prediction. The crowdsourcing part of the detection mechanism is implemented implicitly, by simply observing the natural interaction between users encountering the messages. Specifically, we explore the spread of information on Twitter at the microscopic (user-to-user propagation) level and propose a model that predicts if a message is True or False by observing the latent attributes of the message, along with those of the users interacting with it, and their reactions to the message. We demonstrate the application of this model to the detection of misinformation and rank the relevant message and user features that are most critical in influencing the spread of rumor over the network. Our experiments using real-world data show that the proposed model achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting the credibility of posts on Twitter, a significant boost over state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381339/,2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),7-10 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

The architecture incorporates word attention and context from the author to enhance the classification performance. In particular, the word-level attention mechanism enables the architecture to put more emphasis on important words when constructing the text representation. To derive further context, microblog posts composed by individual authors are exploited since they can reflect style and characteristics in spreading information, which are significant cues to help classify whether the shared content is rumor or legitimate news.

The existing studies have successfully explored user-item interaction via GCN for recommendation task and proved its effectiveness. We argue that a significant limitation of these methods is that social relation, which has been proven to impose positive effects for recommendation in many loss optimization models, has received relatively little scrutiny in GCN. Thus, the resultant embeddings are insufficient to model the potential social propagation effect. In our work, we propose to obtain embeddings by using the neighborhood propagation mechanism on two coupled graph neural networks, i.e., user-item interaction graph and social relation graph, which is capable of capturing the interplay between the item taste of user and user connection. In particular, to address the challenge that different factors on neighborhood propagation process make different contributions for the embedding, we develop a new social recommendation framework with hierarchical attention(i.e., neighbor-level and graph-level attention) Attentional Social Recommendation system (ASR). This allows much flexibility for adaptively acquiring relative importance for different factors.

The pervasiveness of graphs today has raised the demand for algorithms that can answer various questions: Which products would a user like to purchase given her order list? Which users are buying fake followers to increase their public reputation? Myriads of new graph mining algorithms are proposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem formulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes it difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the most suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more severe for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques developed in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoGM, an automated system for graph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework UnifiedGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms, ranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks. Then UnifiedGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to determine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AutoGM explicitly optimizes for the optimal parameter set of UnifiedGM using Bayesian Optimization. AutoGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the optimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy trade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation problem.

Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to `proof' that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data - or `Digital identities' - pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a `real' identity.This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual's digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a `real' identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques.

This method adapts its ML binary classifiers in an incremental fashion, while receiving new annotated examples, and achieves similar performance as batch-based ML models, with 82-93% accuracy, precision, and recall.

10.1109/CloudCom.2010.20,Characterization of Hadoop Jobs Using Unsupervised Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"MapReduce programming paradigm and its open source implementation, Apache Hadoop, is increasingly being used for data-intensive applications in cloud computing environments. An understanding of the characteristics of workloads running in MapReduce environments benefits both the cloud service providers and their users. This work characterizes Hadoop jobs running on production clusters at Yahoo! using unsupervised learning. Unsupervised clustering techniques have been applied to many important problems - ranging from Social Network Analysis to Biomedical Research. We use these techniques to cluster Hadoop MapReduce jobs that are similar in characteristics., Hadoop framework generates metrics for every MapReduce job, such as number of map and reduce tasks, number of bytes read/written to local file system and HDFS etc. We use these metrics and job configuration features such as format of the input/output files, type of compression used etc to find similarity among Hadoop jobs. We study the centroids and densities of these job clusters.

The tool proposed in this study is initially described with the acquisition of the images, then performing the animal tracking, extraction of characteristics, and finally the classification stage. Support Vector Machines are known as one of the most powerful supervised learning algorithms widely used for multiclass image classification. In this work, we propose the classification of mice head orientation using a support vector machine trained with Histogram of Oriented Gradients descriptors, extracted from behavioral video records. We analyze a dataset composed of 1800 images, using 80% of the images for training and 20% for tests. The classifier admits 8 outputs, represented by the trigonometric circle divided into 45 degree parts, allowing the classification of mice head orientation in 8 possible directions.

We explore linguistic features of these known cases using a psychological lexicon dictionary, and train an effective suicidal Weibo post detection model. 6714 tagged posts and several classifiers are used to verify the model. By combining both machine learning and psychological knowledge, SVM classifier has the best performance of different classifiers, yielding an F-measure of 68:3%, a Precision of 78:9%, and a Recall of 60:3%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7307052/,2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops,9-12 Dec. 2014,ieeexplore
10.1109/IROS.2018.8594335,Detection- Tracking for Efficient Person Analysis: The DetTA Pipeline,IEEE,Conferences,"In the past decade many robots were deployed in the wild, and people detection and tracking is an important component of such deployments. On top of that, one often needs to run modules which analyze persons and extract higher level attributes such as age and gender, or dynamic information like gaze and pose. The latter ones are especially necessary for building a reactive, social robot-person interaction. In this paper, we combine those components in a fully modular detection-tracking-analysis pipeline, called DetTA. We investigate the benefits of such an integration on the example of head and skeleton pose, by using the consistent track ID for a temporal filtering of the analysis modules' observations, showing a slight improvement in a challenging real-world scenario. We also study the potential of a so-called “free-flight” mode, where the analysis of a person attribute only relies on the filter's predictions for certain frames. Here, our study shows that this boosts the runtime dramatically, while the prediction quality remains stable. This insight is especially important for reducing power consumption and sharing precious (GPU-)memory when running many analysis components on a mobile platform, especially so in the era of expensive deep learning methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594335/,2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),1-5 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

This was achieved by the introduction of a set of proxemics, body posture and attention features relevant for human-human interaction. The features were extracted from RGB-D image data of a single Kinect and utilized to train two separate machine learning models. Multiple system configurations and feature combinations were tested, and their impact on the detection of user engagement evaluated. Combining all features, our perception system reaches an F1-score of 81% when estimating an observed person’s interaction intent through binary classification. Regression of a user’s level of availability deviates from the given ground truth values by 13.27% on average. Finally, a prototype was implemented which is able to simultaneously run both previous estimates in real-time using a shared feature vector.

However, due to the prohibition of public road tests in Japan, there are few examples of actual applications of robots. Therefore, considerations and problems in the practical application of robots are still unclear. In this paper, by focusing on the implementation of garbage collection technology, we have developed an autonomous garbage collection robot using deep learning. In addition, we have verified the usefulness of our garbage detection technology in outdoor environments by conducting actual demonstrations at HANEDA INNOVATION CITY, which is a large-scale commercial and business complex belonged private property, Utsunomiya University, and Nakanoshima Challenge 2019, which is a field of demonstration experiment in the outdoor environment.

The main factor of the high fatalities was the obvious decline of the driver's cognitive state in their perception, recognition and vehicle control abilities while being sleepy. The key to avoid the terrible consequents is to build a detecting system for ongoing assessment of driver's cognitive state. A quickly growing research, brain-computer interface (BCI), offers a solution offering great assistance to those who require alternative communicatory and control mechanisms. In this study, we propose an alertness/drowsiness classification system based on investigating electroencephalographic (EEG) brain dynamics in lane-keeping driving experiments in a virtual reality (VR) driving environment with a motion platform. The core of the classification system is composed of dimension reduction technique and classifier learning algorithm. In order to find the suitable method for better describing the data structure, we explore the performances using different feature extraction and feature selection methods with different classifiers. Experiment results show that the accuracy is over 80% in most combinations and even near 90% under Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE) going with Gaussian Maximum Likelihood classifier (ML) and k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier (kNN), respectively. In addition, this developed classification system can also solve the individual brain dynamic differences caused from different subjects and overcome the subject dependent limitation.

In these systems, based on different feature representations, various kinds of classifiers are constructed to detect Android malware. Unfortunately, as classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we first extract a set of features from the Android applications (apps) and represent them as binary feature vectors; with these inputs, we then explore the security of a generic learning-based classifier for Android malware detection in the presence of adversaries. To harden the evasion, we first present count featurization to transform the binary feature space into continuous probabilities encoding the distribution in each class (either benign or malicious). To improve the system security while not compromising the detection accuracy, we further introduce softmax function with adversarial parameter to find the best trade-off between security and accuracy for the classifier. Accordingly, we develop a system named DroidEye which integrates our proposed method for Android malware detection. Comprehensive experiments on the real sample collection from Comodo Cloud Security Center are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DroidEye against adversarial Android malware attacks.

It is, however, difficult for us to realize such a learning mechanism in the real world because each agent is exposed only to local interactions with others. Therefore, each agent must acquire a capability, ""sociality"", which finds its own role or niche in the social environment, even if the individual's learning system is self-closed. In this paper, we emphasize that the emergence of ""sociality"" seems to depend on the dual capabilities of an agent's referencing; self-referential and social-referential abilities. In addition, we present a learning model of an agent having such dual referencing capabilities as a bi-referential model, in which each referencing capability is implemented by an evolutional computation method of classifier system. We present simulated results obtained by the proposed bi-referential model and also show the results obtained when the available resources are changed.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology for hashtag recommendation for microblog posts, specifically Twitter. The methodology, EmTaggeR, is built upon a training-testing framework that builds on the top of the concept of word embedding. The training phase comprises of learning word vectors associated with each hashtag, and deriving a word embedding for each hashtag. We provide two training procedures, one in which each hashtag is trained with a separate word embedding model applicable in the context of that hashtag, and another in which each hashtag obtains its embedding from a global context. The testing phase constitutes computing the average word embedding of the test post, and finding the similarity of this embedding with the known embeddings of the hashtags. The tweets that contain the most-similar hashtag are extracted, and all the hashtags that appear in these tweets are ranked in terms of embedding similarity scores. The top-K hashtags that appear in this ranked list, are recommended for the given test post.

In particular, to increase the engagement of participants, previous studies emphasized the importance of social experience among audience members, such as the sense of co-presence elicited by sharing physical reactions or body movements synchronized with music. In this respect, a common strategy in existing platforms is to present avatars of remote human participants in a VR venue and make every avatar imitate movements of the corresponding participant. However, this strategy implicitly assumes that a not small number of users connect simultaneously to watch the same content and thus is not applicable when only a few users gather or a user is watching alone. Therefore, with the aim of providing better experience to a user who participates in live concerts as one of the audience, we examine computational approaches to enhancing the sense of co-presence through virtual audience avatars.

Although many spam filters have been created to help prevent these spam emails from entering a user's inbox, there is a lack or research focusing on text modifications. Currently, Naive Bayes is one of the most popular methods of spam classification because of its simplicity and efficiency.

The ubiquity of social networks and human sensors in the field provides a tremendous amount of real-time, live data about true physical events from around the world. However, while such human sensor data have been exploited for retrospective large-scale event detection such as hurricanes or earthquakes, there has been limited to no success in exploiting this rich resource for general physical event detection. Prior implementation approaches have suffered from the concept drift phenomenon, where real-world data exhibits continuous, unknown, and unbounded changes in its data distribution, making static machine learning models ineffective in the long term.

In principle, the detection process seeks to simultaneously maximize clustering accuracy at the current time step and minimize the clustering drift between two successive time steps. Several evolutionary clustering methods have been developed in an attempt to find the best trade-off between clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, but the classic genetic operators in these methods do not make the best of the inter- and intra-connected relationships between nodes, which limits their effectiveness. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel migration operator to work in tandem with classic genetic operators to improve the discovery of evolving community structures. The operator is implemented within an existing genetic algorithm which relies on a genome representation under a decomposition framework that formulates evolutionary community detection as a multiobjective optimization problem. Moreover, we present a new method of calculating modularity directly from a genome matrix as the objective for measuring the snapshot quality, which results in a wider search space for finding the optimal solution. Experimental results over several synthetic networks and one real-world dynamic social network suggest that our method is superior to two other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and smoothness in discovering evolving community structures in dynamic social networks.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8852006/,2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 July 2019,ieeexplore

MDS-Ach is a middleware made for the Xitome Mobile Dexterous Social (MDS) Robot originally released in 2008. The robot is being actively used at multiple locations including the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (NRL-LASR). The MDS-Ach middleware gives the MDS Robot the software capabilities of modern robot systems using the x- Ach real-time processes based architecture. It controls the MDS Robot directly over the controller area network (CAN) bus via a dedicated real-time daemon. Each process communicates with the others over a network capable shared memory. The shared memory is a ""first-in-last-out"" (i.e. reads the newest data first) non-head-of-line blocking ring buffer which ensures readability of latest data first while retaining the ability to retrieve the older data. When running over a network, UDP or TCP protocol can be utilized depending on the timing and reliability requirements. SSH tunneling is used when secure connections between networked controllers are required. The MDS-Ach middleware is designed to allow for simple and easy development with modern robotic tools while adding accessibility and usability to our non-hardware-focused partners. Real-time collision avoidance and a robust inverse kinematics solution are implemented within the MDS-Ach system. Examples of collision avoidance, inverse kinematics implementation, and the software architecture are given.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371065/,2018 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC),9-11 March 2018,ieeexplore

Restaurants give considerable attention to customers' feedback about their service, since the reputation of the business depends on it. Key factors of evaluating customer satisfaction are, being able to deliver the services effectively to lessen the time of consumption, as well as maintaining a high quality of service. In most cases of selecting a prominent restaurant, customers focus on their choice of favorite food in addition to available seating and space options. Long waiting times and serving the wrong order is a common mistake that happens in every restaurant that eventually leads to customer dissatisfaction. Objectives of this online application “Foody” is to address these deficiencies and provide efficient and accurate services to the customer, by providing unique menus to each customer considering their taste. This concept is implemented as a mobile application using latest IT concepts such as Business Intelligence, Data Mining, Predictive Analysis and Artificial Intelligence. This includes graphics and 3D modeling that provide existent physical information related to food such as colors, sizes and further user can view the ingredients of the meal as well as the available tables. In addition, the app shows the real-time map to the restaurant. Current table reservation status is indicated by the color change of the table. Unique food recommendation and it's order for each customer is generated by analyzing their social media information and the system notifies the customer the wait time by calculating it.

Imitation plays a key role in the development of social skills at a young age, and studies have shown that the ability to imitate is impaired in children with ASD.

Instead of pure motoric imitation, we propose imitation tasks involving real objects in the environment. The introduction of physical objects strongly emphasizes joint attention skills, another area that is typically impaired in children with ASD. Furthermore, we present simple object detection, manipulation, tracking and gesture recognition algorithms, suitable for real-time, onboard execution on the small-scale humanoid robot NAO.

(Extended Abstract),IEEE,Conferences,"Deal selection on Groupon is a typical social learning and decision making process, where the quality of a deal is usually unknown to the customers. The customers must acquire this knowledge through social learning from other social medias such as reviews on Yelp. Additionally, the quality of a deal depends on both the state of the vendor and decisions of other customers on Groupon. How social learning and network externality affect the decisions of customers in deal selection on Groupon is our main interest. We develop a data-driven game-theoretic framework to understand the rational deal selection behaviors cross social medias. The sufficient condition of the Nash equilibrium is identified. A value-iteration algorithm is proposed to find the optimal deal selection strategy. We conduct a year-long experiment to trace the competitions among deals on Groupon and the corresponding Yelp ratings. We utilize the dataset to analyze the deal selection game with realistic settings. Finally, the performance of the proposed social learning framework is evaluated with real data. The results suggest that customers do make decisions in a rational way instead of following naive strategies, and there is still room to improve their decisions with assistance from the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8509483/,2018 IEEE 34th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),16-19 April 2018,ieeexplore

However, they omit the real word situation of social data, that is, social spam is fast changing with new topics or events. Therefore, traditional approaches cannot effectively achieve online detection of the ""drifting"" social spam with a fixed statistic feature set. In this paper, we present Sifter, a system which can detect online social spam in a scalable manner without the labor-intensive feature engineering. The Sifter system is two-fold: (1) a decentralized DHT-based overlay deployment for harnessing the group characteristics of social spam activities within a specific topic/event; (2) a social spam processing with the support of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to get rid of the traditional manual feature engineering.

School systems, just like many other social networks, appear to have a hierarchical structure. Understanding this structure could be the key to better evaluating student performance and improving school quality.

We design an interaction-based similarity measure to accomplish hierarchical clustering in order to detect hierarchical structures in social networks (e.g. school district networks). This method uses a multi-agent system, for it is based on agent interactions. With the network structure detected, we also build a model, which is based on the MAXQ algorithm, to decompose the funding policy task into subtasks and then evaluate these subtasks by using funding distribution policies from past years and looking for possible relationships between student performances and funding policies. For the experiment, we use real school data from Bexar County's 15 school districts in Texas. The first result shows that our interaction-based method is able to generate meaningful clustering and dendrograms for social networks.

First, the upper body poses of standing persons are classified into seven categories of views. For each category, a mean template, variance template, and percentage template are generated. Then, the template region is divided into positive and negative regions, corresponding to the region of bodies and surrounding open space. A weak classifier is designed for each pixel in the template. A new EM-like Adaboost learning algorithm is designed to learn the Adaboost template. Different from existing Adaboost classifiers, we show that the Adaboost template can be used not only for recognition but also for adaptive top-down segmentation. By using Adaboost template, only a few positive samples for each category are required for learning. Comparison with conventional template matching techniques has been made.

Because this data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way at scale, social media has been adopted as a “passive sensor” to study human behavior. However, such research is impacted by the lack of homogeneity in the use of social media, and the engineering challenges in obtaining such data. This paper proposes a statistical framework to leverage the potential of social media in sensing studies of human behavior, while navigating the challenges associated with its sparsity. Our framework is situated in a large-scale in-situ study concerning the passive assessment of psychological constructs of 757 information workers wherein of four sensing streams was deployed - bluetooth beacons, wearable, smartphone, and social media. Our framework includes principled feature transformation and machine learning models that predict latent social media features from the other passive sensors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this imputation framework via a high correlation of 0.78 between actual and imputed social media features. With the imputed features we test and validate predictions on psychological constructs like personality traits and affect. We find that adding the social media data streams, in their imputed form, improves the prediction of these measures.

For the purpose of human-robot interaction, the robot should have the ability to perform a variety of actions including face recognition, path planning, etc. In this paper, face recognition has been implemented on the Sanbot robot. Since the Sanbot robot is intended to work in real environment, therefore indoor and outdoor environment is taken into account in proposing the corresponding face recognition algorithm. For each case a robust pre-processing algorithm should be designed and which can circumvent a challenging problem in face recognition, namely, different lighting conditions (light intensity, angle of radiation, etc.). In case of indoor environment, faces in an captured image by the robot HD camera are found using a Haar-cascade algorithm. Afterwards, a histogram equalization is applied to face images in order to standardize them. Then commonly practiced Deep convolutional neural network structures such as Inception and ResNet are used to design a model and trained end-to-end on a customized dataset with strong augmentation. Finally, by using a voting method, proper prediction is carried out on each face. In what concerns the outdoor environment, which has more challenges, upon applying histogram Equalization on the captured image, faces are found using a MultiTask Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network. Then face images are aligned as head orientation are corrected. Finally, cropped face image is fed to Siamese Network in order to extract face features and verifying individuals.

Drawing from the models of Baron-Cohen (1995) and Leslie (1994), a novel architecture called embodied theory of mind was developed to link high-level cognitive skills to the low-level perceptual abilities of a humanoid robot. The implemented system determines visual saliency based on inherent object attributes, high-level task constraints, and the attentional states of others. Objects of interest are tracked in real-time to produce motion trajectories which are analyzed by a set of naive physical laws designed to discriminate animate from inanimate movement. Animate objects can be the source of attentional states (detected by finding faces and head orientation) as well as intentional states (determined by motion trajectories between objects).

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data.

An alternate strategy is to learn information about video content using far less compute intensive metadata surrogates. This paper describes a video recommender tool implemented in GovCloud using a novel approach of using lightweight video metadata to learn and classify video content. In contrast to popular video recommender systems that use consumption models for classification, the new approach used in our tool is based solely on the video metadata along with domain expertise used to truth a relatively small subset of relevant video content. The tool is very user-friendly and captures practical knowledge of the user resulting in good learning model. The architecture and implementation specifics of the tool is outlined in this paper. The classifier performance using metadata from tens of thousands of real postings exceeds 90% for both recall and ROC metrics.

10.1109/OCEANS.2018.8604686,Learned Anticipation Strategy on Complex Behaviors and as an Approach to Generalization Behavior for the Coordination of an AUV Fleet,IEEE,Conferences,"Anticipation is natural behavior seen in certain organisms when they try to adapt their behavior to create an accurate reaction to an event that will happen in the future based on sequential information that extracted from the environment and other organisms. Anticipation has been studied from both the human and the animal perspectives and science has been taking some of these ideas to implement this behavior in machines. Research and studies of anticipation using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods has been growing during the past years within different fields, including Robotics, Stock Market, Weather Forecast, Social Media, among others. At the University of Idaho, we have been focusing on studying Anticipation using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). This paper analyzes the impact on coordination of including an anticipation module to adapt to complex behaviors and to make decisions based on generalization while running as part of a simulation of a fleet of AUVs following a magnetic signature assessment (MSA) task. During this task, a moving Target Ship (TS) shares information about its behavior with the fleet of AUVs while the fleet tries to maintain formation and reach a designated meeting point at the same time as the TS. The TS behaviors include sudden and/or complex changes in movement during the experiment. These changes in the TS's movement make it difficult for the AUVs to reach the meeting point at the same time as the TS without additional information. Progress messages from the TS are used by the AUVs to adjust their behavior, but the messages may be sparse. A portion of the data that represents the TS's behavior was used as training data for the anticipation module in the AUVs. The remaining data was used as brand new cases that the anticipation module would try to solve to encourage generalization. Generalization occurs when the robot can solve a task that it was not trained for, but there was sufficient training data to result in reasonable solutions. For these experiments, the messages that are sent by the TS to the AUVs report the TS's progress to the goal. The TS reports its progress using Fuzzy set membership values. This strategy is used to model real-world situations where progress cannot be defined with exact values. The membership values are represented by fuzzy sets including On Schedule, Behind Schedule, Ahead of Schedule, etc. This strategy gives a more human-like approach to the AUVs for decision making because humans often say things like “I'm a little behind schedule”. The anticipation module works as an aid for the communication between the TS and the fleet of AUVs. It tries to keep the fleet running on track and synchronized with the TS behavior by filling in missing messages with an anticipated message. In this research it is assumed that missing and corrupt messages occur because of a noisy or low-bandwidth communications. The experiments simulate this condition by sending messages more infrequently. The TS stops broadcasting messages for a specific time period that has been selected before starting the test. Versions of the anticipation module, using a Neural Network model and a Fuzzy Logic model were tested. To have comparable results, the position of the meeting point is constant during each experiment and is used as a point of reference. The effectiveness of the anticipation module was evaluated by measuring the distance between the actual meeting point of the fleet of AUVs and the TS and the desired meeting point. In general the anticipation module reduced the error significantly. This included the tests using the novel behaviors that were not part of the training set. These last results lead to the idea that, with the right training data, the AUVs are displaying generalization behavior. In general, the anticipation module helps the fleet of AUVs to infer the behavior of the TS and they synchronize to the TS even when there was a lack of information, caused by missing messages.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8604686/,OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE Charleston,22-25 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICDM.2015.10,Learning User Preferences across Multiple Aspects for Merchant Recommendation,IEEE,Conferences,"With the pervasive use of mobile devices, Location Based Social Networks(LBSNs) have emerged in past years. These LBSNs, allowing their users to share personal experiences and opinions on visited merchants, have very rich and useful information which enables a new breed of location-based services, namely, Merchant Recommendation. Existing techniques for merchant recommendation simply treat each merchant as an item and apply conventional recommendation algorithms, e.g., Collaborative Filtering, to recommend merchants to a target user. However, they do not differentiate the user's real preferences on various aspects, and thus can only achieve limited success. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by utilizing and analyzing user reviews to discover user preferences in different aspects. Following the intuition that a user rating represents a personalized rational choice, we propose a novel utility-based approach by combining collaborative and individual views to estimate user preference (i.e., rating). An optimization algorithm based on a Gaussian model is developed to train our merchant recommendation approach. Lastly we evaluate the proposed approach in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and cold-start using two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.20,Link Prediction in Social Networks Using Computationally Efficient Topological Features,IEEE,Conferences,"Online social networking sites have become increasingly popular over the last few years. As a result, new interdisciplinary research directions have emerged in which social network analysis methods are applied to networks containing hundreds millions of users. Unfortunately, links between individuals may be missing due to imperfect acquirement processes or because they are not yet reflected in the online network (i.e., friends in real world did not form a virtual connection.) Existing link prediction techniques lack the scalability required for full application on a continuously growing social network which may be adding everyday users with thousands of connections. The primary bottleneck in link prediction techniques is extracting structural features required for classifying links. In this paper we propose a set of simple, easy-to-compute structural features that can be analyzed to identify missing links. We show that a machine learning classifier trained using the proposed simple structural features can successfully identify missing links even when applied to a hard problem of classifying links between individuals who have at least one common friend. A new friends measure that we developed is shown to be a good predictor for missing links and an evaluation experiment was performed on five large social networks datasets: Face book, Flickr, You Tube, Academia and The Marker.

Log parsing serves as the the first step towards automated log analysis. However, the current log parsing methods are not adaptive. Without intra-service adaptiveness, log parsing cannot handle software/firmware upgrade because learned templates cannot match new type of logs. In addition, without cross-service adaptiveness, the logs of a new type of service cannot be accurately parsed when this service is newly deployed. We propose LogParse, an adaptive log parsing framework, to support intra-service and cross-service incremental template learning and update. LogParse turns the template generation problem into a word classification problem and learns the features of template words and variable words. We evaluate LogParse on four public production log datasets. The results demonstrate that LogParse supports accurate adaptive template update (increased from 0.559 to nearly 1.0 parsing accuracy), and a trained LogParse is adaptive for a brand new service's log parsing. Because of LogParse's adaptiveness, we also apply LogParse to an interesting application, log compression and deployed log compression in a top cloud service provider.

10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.242,Modeling Curiosity in Virtual Companions to Improve Human Learners' Learning Experience,IEEE,Conferences,"A key design aspect for virtual learning companions is their believability. A lot of attention has been paid to emotion modeling which is at the core of believability. However, most of the existing emotion models neglect the epistemology-based emotions, which are knowledge-related emotions that affect the human learning process. Studies have shown that curiosity is an important epistemology-based emotion that positively influences social learning. Hence, modeling curiosity in learning companions may improve human learners' learning experience in a virtual environment. However, existing curiosity models assume simplified cognitive processes and fail to capture multiple sources of curiosity stimuli. In this paper, we propose a novel model of curiosity for learning companions to capture salient curiosity stimuli through a psychologically inspired approach. Our model is built based on Berlyne's theory and considers three most salient appraisal variables in a virtual learning environment, including novelty, surprise, and uncertainty. The model is built on planbased knowledge representations augmented with planning.

10.1109/TrustCom50675.2020.00243,Monitoring Social Media for Vulnerability-Threat Prediction and Topic Analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Publicly available software vulnerabilities and exploit code are often abused by malicious actors to launch cyberattacks to vulnerable targets. Organizations not only have to update their software to the latest versions, but do effective patch management and prioritize security-related patching as well. In addition to intelligence sources such as Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) alerts, cybersecurity news, national vulnerability database (NBD), and commercial cybersecurity vendors, social media is another valuable source that facilitates early stage intelligence gathering. To early detect future cyber threats based on publicly available resources on the Internet, we propose a dynamic vulnerability-threat assessment model to predict the tendency to be exploited for vulnerability entries listed in Common Vulnerability Exposures, and also to analyze social media contents such as Twitter to extract meaningful information. The model takes multiple aspects of vulnerabilities gathered from different sources into consideration. Features range from profile information to contextual information about these vulnerabilities. For the social media data, this study leverages machine learning techniques specially for Twitter which helps to filter out non-cybersecurity-related tweets and also label the topic categories of each tweet. When applied to predict the vulnerabilities exploitation and analyzed the real-world social media discussion data, it showed promising prediction accuracy with purified social media intelligence. Moreover, the AI-enabling modules have been deployed into a threat intelligence platform for further applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9343128/,"2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)",29 Dec.-1 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore

The supervised models in this experiment are analysed in terms of performance over time by different sources of data (Surface web and Deep web). Additionally, to simulate real-world situations, these models are evaluated using time-stamped messages from our datasets, posted over time on social media platforms. We have found that models applied to hacker forums (deep web) presents an accuracy deterioration in less than a 1-year period, whereas models applied to Twitter (surface web) have not shown a decrease in accuracy for the same period of time. The problem is alleviated by retraining the model with new instances (and applying weights) in order to reduce the effects of concept drift.

10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386544,Multi-language person social relation extraction model based on distant supervision,IEEE,Conferences,"Relation extraction refers to a method of efficiently identifying entities from the text and extracting semantic relations between entities. The person social relation extraction is one of the most important fields in relation extraction. A large number of techniques have been proposed on relation extraction thus far, and supervised machine learning methods are the most widely used. However, the disadvantages of supervised machine learning methods are that manually annotating training data set is costly and time-consuming, which block the improvement of the supervised relation extraction model. Aiming at the limitation, we propose a novel person social relation extraction model on both Chinese and English corpus with distant supervision. Distant supervision method can make full use of the information in the knowledge base and provide training data without manual effort. In particular, it is an effective method in the very large corpora which contains thousands of relations. In this model, we use distant supervision method to get the weak-labeled data set. Then, a supervised method is used to train a classifier, which is expect to distinguish the relation between the person entities in the input sentence.

Emergency response is one such area that stands to gain from these advances. By processing billions of texts and images a minute, events can be automatically detected to enable emergency response workers to better assess rapidly evolving situations and deploy resources accordingly. To date, most event detection techniques in this area have focused on image-only or text-only approaches, limiting detection performance and impacting the quality of information delivered to crisis response teams. In this paper, we present a new multimodal fusion method that leverages both images and texts as input. In particular, we introduce a cross-attention module that can filter uninformative and misleading components from weak modalities on a sample by sample basis. In addition, we employ a multimodal graph-based approach to stochastically transition between embeddings of different multimodal pairs during training to better regularize the learning process as well as dealing with limited training data by constructing new matched pairs from different samples.

The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of PBEM on two real-life trajectory-based check-in datasets.

And GCN has been gaining popularity due to its success in real-world applications such as recommendation, natural language processing, etc. Because neural network and graph propagation have high computation complexity, GPUs have been introduced to both neural network training and graph processing. However, it is notoriously difficult to perform efficient GCN computing on data parallel hardware like GPU due to the sparsity and irregularity in graphs. In this paper, we present PCGCN, a novel and general method to accelerate GCN computing by taking advantage of the locality in graphs. We experimentally demonstrate that real-world graphs usually have the clustering property that can be used to enhance the data locality in GCN computing. Then, PCGCN proposes to partition the whole graph into chunks according to locality and process subgraphs with a dual-mode computing strategy which includes a selective and a full processing methods for sparse and dense subgraphs, respectively.

More and more passenger enjoy the drop-off service. In practice, we find an interesting question: if a passenger has ever choice the drop-off service, whether they are willing to recommend this service to other traveler? Although the acknowledgment that social learning is related to travel decision is promoted, quantitative analysis about how social learning shape and impact the decision of passengers is still limited. We study and estimate a diffusion probability between different passengers by proposing a CCM (Co-travel Link Cascade Model) based on a modified EM iterative algorithm. Then, we segment passengers into three types (Influenced, Unchecked and Immune). The three types of passengers are predicated by approaches of IC-like model, Random Forest model and probabilistic model, respectively.

As opposed to using a multi-class counting approach, this paper aggregates CSI for the occupancies below and above a COVID-Safe limit. We show that this binary classification approach to the COVID safe decision problem has similar or better accuracy outcomes with much lower computational complexity, allowing for real-world implementation on IoT embedded devices.

Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic.

10.1109/eCrime.2012.6489521,PhishAri: Automatic realtime phishing detection on twitter,IEEE,Conferences,"With the advent of online social media, phishers have started using social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare to spread phishing scams. Twitter is an immensely popular micro-blogging network where people post short messages of 140 characters called tweets. It has over 100 million active users who post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started using Twitter as a medium to spread phishing because of this vast information dissemination. Further, it is difficult to detect phishing on Twitter unlike emails because of the quick spread of phishing links in the network, short size of the content, and use of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri, detects phishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific features along with URL features to detect whether a tweet posted with a URL is phishing or not. Some of the Twitter specific features we use are tweet content and its characteristics like length, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features used are the characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as age of the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee ratio. These twitter specific features coupled with URL based features prove to be a strong mechanism to detect phishing tweets. We use machine learning classification techniques and detect phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52%. We have deployed our system for end-users by providing an easy to use Chrome browser extension. The extension works in realtime and classifies a tweet as phishing or safe. In this research, we show that we are able to detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high accuracy which is much faster than public blacklists and as well as Twitter's own defense mechanism to detect malicious content. We also performed a quick user evaluation of PhishAri in a laboratory study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of PhishAri and showed that users like and find it convenient to use PhishAri in real-world.

However, after consulting a large amount of data, I found that most hospitals in the market use hard levers and springs as mechanical structures, which will result in excessive resistance, poor finger curls, and even aggravate the disease due to improper use. In contrast, the deformable structure is softer. Meanwhile, it can actively bend the fingers of patient through the inflation control method to achieve the purpose of safety and effectiveness.

This corresponds to a sequential decision process where an agent has to choose at each iteration an action to perform, according to some knowledge about the decision environment and the current available actions, with the aim to maximize a cumulative amount of rewards over time. Many instances of the problem exist, depending on the kind of rewards we collect - real, binary, natural - and various algorithms are known to be efficient for some of these instances, either empirically or theoretically. In this paper we focus on the case of count payoffs, which corresponds to bandit problems where rewards are integer rewards, potentially unbounded. Based on a Bayesian Poisson regression model, we propose two new contextual bandit algorithms for this particular case with several concrete applications in real life: an Upper Confidence Bound algorithm and a Thompson Sampling strategy.

While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details. Through the research conducted for the purpose of this study, both challenges are tackled along with others detailed further on simultaneously using Genetic Algorithms (GA) over a Partial CC (PartCC) model, which is a modification over CC.

Social media provides a dynamic platform that includes the formation and deformation of connections. Two types of connections, i.e., Positive and Negative, can exist in a social network. Positive connections are a sign of friendship or trust, while negative connections show enmity or distrust. Various applications in several fields have networks containing both positive and negative edges. Reliable prediction of edge sign can greatly influence in recommending friendly relationships while preventing enemy relationships across the network. Prediction of edge signs has been explored previously also. However, we intend to predict the sign of edges based on extracted features of nodes constructed upon theories of social psychology that includes classical balance theory and the status theory. Moreover, we employ emotional information theory and use the combined extracted features from all the theories to analyze networks for better prediction. Our results show that the proposed methodology has obtained significant accuracy when implemented on two real-life datasets, namely Slashdot and Epinions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146087/,2019 IEEE 18th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),23-25 July 2019,ieeexplore

Moreover, the assessment of the current methods is carried out and the ways to improve their efficiency are presented. To begin with, there are two main disadvantages of the dating applications nowadays. The first one is imperfect algorithms of selection and the second one is the lack of ""human touch"". It means, that people with common friends in real life will communicate better in the Internet. Due to that, the major features of the research are searching among the common social circle and processing the data by parsing the social network of the potential partner. As a result, the program compares the personal information of every user and makes the pairs with more similar data.

Secondly, XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost models were trained according to the above constructed features to predict trust propagation in social commerce. Finally, results of XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost models were integrated using Soft-Voting technique as the final prediction results.

However, the dominant trend of these studies has been towards designing new prediction models. The typical approach is to use social information to build those models for each new user. Due to the inherent complexity of this prediction process, for full cold-start user in particular, the performance of most SRS fall a great deal. We, rather, propose that new users are best served by models already built in system. Selecting a prediction model from a set of strong linked users might offer better results than building a personalized model for full cold-start users. We contribute to this line of work comparing several matrix factorization based SRS under full cold-start user scenario, and proposing a general model selection approach, called ToSocialRec, that leverages existing recommendation models to offer items for new users. Our framework is not only able to handle several social network connection weight metrics, but any metric that can be correlated with preference similarity among users, named here as Preference-like score. We perform experiments on real life datasets that show this technique is as efficient or more than current state-of-the-art techniques for cold-start user.

The feeling of waving goodbye to an old technology may hence explain why collectors and museums are increasingly searching for such type of photographs. In such scenario, a barrier set to the preservation and analysis of the enormous source of information is the unavailability of a fine-grained digitization and cataloguing infrastructure. An opportunity to resolve such issue is offered by augmented reality (AR): we envision an AR-application capable of individuating and segmenting photos, while browsing through a family album. In addition to this digitization step, we also include a second one where the digitized images are analyzed, tagging them with meta-data pertaining their presumed socio-historical context and their date. The addition of such meta-data is key not only from a cataloguing point of view, but also from a conservation perspective. In fact, analog photos are more often preserved when some information pertaining their subject and their date is known.

Real world environments are complex, dynamic, and uncertain. Human-Robot interactions can be unstructured and unanticipated. In addition, when the robot is intended to be a shared public resource, management issues such as user access and user privacy arise, leading to design choices that can impact on users' trust and the adoption of the designed system. In this paper we propose a user registration and login system for a social robot and report on people's preferences when registering their personal details with the robot to access services. This study is the first iteration of a larger body of work investigating potential use cases for the Pepper social robot at a government managed centre for startups and innovation. We prototyped and deployed a system for user registration with the robot, which gives users control over registering and accessing services with either face recognition technology or a QR code.

The focus has been on estimating the structure and strength of peer influence and its impact on the decisions of an individual. Less attention has been given to incorporating contextual information and individuals' hidden characteristics (or bias). In this work, we examine the social dynamics where social influence and contextual information play pivotal roles in driving one's decision. We design a probabilistic graphical model called CLAP to understand users' decision behavior in a social network, with an emphasis on both social-level and individual-level factors. To this end, the proposed model introduces hidden bias states associated with each actor and jointly estimates each actor's hidden bias state together with the social influence network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLAP on two types of social networks, a real-world US Congress network where senators vote on new bills, and online Twitter networks where users debate on the effectiveness of vaccine and lockdown policy during COVID-19. The experiment results show that CLAP outperforms state-of-the-art game theoretic approaches in predicting user decision.

The contents can be requested from the proximity users via Device-to-device (D2D) communications while proactive caching the popular content to local users. However, the assumptions that content popularity is equal to user preference in several existing studies, which are invalid and not rigorous due to the fact that content popularity is calculated by the statistic of user requests within a certain period while user preference reflects the probability of a content requested by the individual user. Motivated by this, in this paper, we study the edge caching optimization of hierarchical wireless networks. Our aiming is to maximize the size of content offload by D2D communications. In particular, the edge caching policy with D2D sharing model based on the analysis of user mobility and social relationship is derived.

Though well trained clinicians, medical and psychological treatments are available for depression treatment, persons or families are reluctant to speak out/reach doctors about this disorder for various social reasons. Diagnosis of depression disorder includes numerous interviews with patient and family, clinical analysis, questionnaires which is time consuming and also demands well trained clinicians. In the present era of Machine learning, automation of depression detection is not complicated and can easily be deployed. However, the automation should use fewer resources, provide accurate results with more reachability.

Most of the efficient IPS methods utilize radio-based solutions to meet the accuracy requirement of indoor LBS. Typically fingerprinting localization is realized, which requires a site survey process where radio signatures of a localization area are annotated with their actual recorded locations. The site survey is time-consuming and labor-intensive that intensifies practical limits and challenges in realizing a reliable and scalable IPS.

In particular, we suggest combining access point (AP) proximity information and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) to collect labeled data without any human intervention. The crowdsourced training data are fed to model a Gaussian process, which predicts the mean RSS and its corresponding variance across the testbed. To validate the proposed method, we compared the predicted data with the manually measured one and utilized the predicted data for localization using weighted k-nearest neighbor (Wk-NN) and maximum likelihood (ML) based fingerprinting localization.

Motivated by the great power of Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), many current researches adopt GNN-based detectors to reveal the anomalous users.

In this paper, we propose an innovate Relevance-aware Anomalous Users Detection model (RAU-GNN) to obtain a fine-grained detection result. RAU-GNN first extracts multiple relations of all types of users in social network, including both benign and anomalous users, and accordingly constructs the multiple user relation graph.

Concretely, by integrating Graph Convolution Network(GCN) and Graph Attention Network(GAT), we design a GCN-based relation fusion layer to aggregate initial information from different relations, and a GAT-based embedding layer to obtain the high-level embeddings.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious.

10.1109/AIID51893.2021.9456477,Research on Privacy Protection Technology in Face Identity Authentication System Based on Edge Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"In today's society, the rapid development of the Internet makes People's Daily life become more intelligent and diversified. Today's society has entered a multifaceted era where everything is interconnected. Artificial intelligence technology is gradually replacing some traditional human services, such as intelligent robot customer service instead of traditional human customer service, intelligent face scanning security check in railway stations instead of traditional manual ticket checking, unmanned supermarket automatic checkout has liberated some social labor costs. All these changes are the result of the development of artificial intelligence technology in today's society. In recent years, unicorn startups focused on biometrics have sprung up all around us, such as BTU and its MEG VII (Face ++). Thanks to the development of Internet and artificial intelligence technology, in many application fields, the traditional access control and identity authentication technology based on password verification is gradually transforming to the scheme based on biometric identification verification. Secure identity authentication is very important to the application of Internet. Face recognition is the most popular technology among all biometric identification technologies. In the field of biometric identification technology, it has become the most widely used technology in the field of identity authentication because of its unique non-invasive, support for infrared and visible light, no need for user cooperation and many other advantages. In the field of education, examinee identification, pedestrian identification detection at the entrance of railway stations, face electronic payment, intelligent video surveillance system, intelligent attendance and access control system, intelligent unmanned supermarkets and customs clearance ports become the pioneer fields of face recognition applications. It can be seen that the era of “national face brushing” has arrived, and the application of face recognition technology will only be more and more widespread in the current era and in the future. However, due to the sensitivity of biometric data and the heterogeneity and openness of network environment, the privacy leakage of biometric data is difficult to avoid. At present, fog computing and edge computing have been paid more and more attention in many fields. In the case that cloud service providers are unable to provide sufficient security, edge computing shows its advantages. In this paper, mobile edge computing is introduced for the first time into the face privacy protection identity authentication system based on cloud server outsourcing computing. It can not only greatly reduce the interaction frequency between users and cloud server, improve the availability and fault tolerance of the system, but also contribute to the implementation of privacy protection scheme. A deep constitutional neural network for face feature extraction is trained using deep learning framework Cafe. Cosine similarity is used to complete face verification. A privacy protection scheme based on the secure nearest neighbor algorithm is proposed, which can not only protect the security of the face feature data at the edge computing node, but also allow the edge computing node to complete the face recognition operation against the encrypted face feature data. In addition, the encryption scheme does not require large computing resources, and the accuracy of face recognition in cipher text is exactly the same as that in explain. At present, most of the solutions either have high computational complexity or poor security performance. How to reduce the computational complexity and improve the real-time performance of the system while ensuring the high security of the private data has important research significance and value. Therefore, in the cloud server outsourcing computing environment, how to complete biometric identification on the premise of protecting the privacy of biological data has become a research hot spot.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9456477/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Design (AIID),28-30 May 2021,ieeexplore

Based on made experiences humans are able to adapt their behaviour in order to solve tasks. Another important aspect of human decision making is the ability to discard learned behaviour when the usual decisions, concerning a stimulus, lead to a bad outcome. For robots intended to be embedded in a social environment, the adaptability of behaviour is an important factor. Research of human decision behaviour shows, that emotions play a decisive role, even for learning and reversal learning. In this paper, improvements and further results of a previously presented framework for decision making based on an emotional memory are presented. The improvements include the reduction of the amount of previous knowledge that has to be implemented and an evaluation concerning reversal learning. For evaluation purposes, a typical reversal learning task, performed by real subjects, has been used. The results show that this framework allows the adaption of behaviour comparable to human subjects and offers decisive improvements, which lead to better results in reversal learning tasks without the need to directly declare a task as such one.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6681479/,2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction,2-5 Sept. 2013,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560893,Robot Navigation in Constrained Pedestrian Environments using Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Navigating fluently around pedestrians is a necessary capability for mobile robots deployed in human environments, such as buildings and homes. While research on social navigation has focused mainly on the scalability with the number of pedestrians in open spaces, typical indoor environments present the additional challenge of constrained spaces such as corridors and doorways that limit maneuverability and influence patterns of pedestrian interaction. We present an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL) to learn policies capable of dynamic adaptation to the presence of moving pedestrians while navigating between desired locations in constrained environments. The policy network receives guidance from a motion planner that provides waypoints to follow a globally planned trajectory, whereas RL handles the local interactions. We explore a compositional principle for multi-layout training and find that policies trained in a small set of geometrically simple layouts successfully generalize to more complex unseen layouts that exhibit composition of the structural elements available during training. Going beyond walls-world like domains, we show transfer of the learned policy to unseen 3D reconstructions of two real environments. These results support the applicability of the compositional principle to navigation in real-world buildings and indicate promising usage of multi-agent simulation within reconstructed environments for tasks that involve interaction. https://ai.stanford.edu/∼cdarpino/socialnavconstrained/",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9560893/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),30 May-5 June 2021,ieeexplore

This study aims to develop a robot assistant that facilitates mindfulness training by means of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. To achieve this goal, we collected EEG signals from two groups of subjects engaging in a meditative vs. non-meditative human-robot interaction (HRI) and evaluated cerebral hemispheric asymmetry, which is recognized as a well-defined indicator of emotional states. Moreover, using self-reported affective states, we strived to explain asymmetry changes based on pre- and post-experiment mood alterations. We found that unlike earlier meditation studies, the fronto-central activations in alpha and theta frequency bands were not influenced by robot-guided mindfulness practice, however there was a significantly greater right-sided activity in the occipital gamma band of Meditation group, which is attributed to increased sensory awareness and open monitoring. In addition, there was a significant main effect of Time on participant's self-reported affect, indicating an improved mood after interaction with the robot regardless of the interaction type. Our results suggest that EEG responses during robot-guided meditation hold promise in real-time detection and neurofeedback of mindful state to the user, however the experienced neurophysiological changes may differ based on the meditation practice and recruited tools. This study is the first to report EEG changes during mindfulness practice with a robot.

Facing noisy, incomplete and asynchronous data, as well as inaccurate recognition results of machine learning models, we design an algorithm to aggregate multimodal data relevant to the same activity and propose an activity-semantic graph to comprehensively characterize each activity by fusing knowledge of multimodal data. Based on the activity-semantic graph, the privacy-preserving shared activity detection and data sharing method is designed, which protects both raw data and semantic information of data.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system.

10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00024,SRaSLR: A Novel Social Relation Aware Service Label Recommendation Model,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rapid development of new technologies such as cloud, edge and mobile computing, the number and diversity of available services are dramatically exploding and services have become increasingly important to people's daily work and life. As a consequence, using service label recommendation techniques to automatically categorize services plays a crucial role in many service computing tasks, such as service discovery, service composition, and service organization. There have been many service label recommendation studies that have achieved remarkable performance. However, these studies mainly focus on using the text information in service profiles to recommend labels for services while overlooking those social relations that widely exist among services. We argue that such social relations can help to obtain more precise recommendation results. In this paper, we propose a novel Social Relation aware Service Label Recommendation model called SRaSLR, which combines text information in service profiles and social network relations among services. A deep learning based model is constructed based on feature fusion of the two perspectives. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Programmable Web dataset, and the experiment results show that SRaSLR yields better performance than existing methods.

Traditional disaster management systems work well for analyzing static and historical information. However, they cannot process dynamic streams of data that are being generated in real-time. This paper presents STIMULATE - a System for Real-time Information Acquisition and Learning for Disaster Management that can (1) fetch and process tweets in real-time, (2) classify those tweets into FEMA defined categories for rescue priorities using pre-trained deep learning models and generate useful insights, (3) find FEMA defined stranded people for rescue missions of varying priorities, and (4) provide an interactive web interface for rescue management given the available resources. The STIMULATE prototype is primarily built using the Python Flask framework for web interaction. Additionally, it is deployed in the cloud environment using Hadoop and MongoDB for scalable storage, and on-demand computing for processing extensive social media data. The deep learning models in the STIMULATE prototype use Python Keras and the TensorFlow library. We use Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for developing the tweet classifier. Further, we use the Python PyWSGI WebSocket server for rescue scheduling operations. We present a deep learning system trained on hurricane Harvey and Irma datasets only.

The purpose is to allow city managers to act timely on preventing crime occurence as detected from tweets posted by real users. Key issues here are the processing of a large volume of data and modularization and customization capabilities implemented through pipelined modules for robust, fast, real time tweet acquisition and storage.

10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460968,Socially Compliant Navigation Through Raw Depth Inputs with Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"We present an approach for mobile robots to learn to navigate in dynamic environments with pedestrians via raw depth inputs, in a socially compliant manner. To achieve this, we adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) strategy, which improves upon a pre-trained behavior cloning policy. Our approach overcomes the disadvantages of previous methods, as they heavily depend on the full knowledge of the location and velocity information of nearby pedestrians, which not only requires specific sensors, but also the extraction of such state information from raw sensory input could consume much computation time. In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning. The real-world deployment also shows that our method is capable of guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a socially compliant manner directly through raw depth inputs. In addition, we release a simulation plugin for modeling pedestrian behaviors based on the social force model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8460968/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),21-25 May 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/SP.2019.00032,Stealthy Porn: Understanding Real-World Adversarial Images for Illicit Online Promotion,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress in deep learning (DP), which also brings their potential weaknesses to the spotlights of security and machine learning studies. With important discoveries made by adversarial learning research, surprisingly little attention, however, has been paid to the real-world adversarial techniques deployed by the cybercriminal to evade image-based detection. Unlike the adversarial examples that induce misclassification using nearly imperceivable perturbation, real-world adversarial images tend to be less optimal yet equally effective. As a first step to understand the threat, we report in the paper a study on adversarial promotional porn images (APPIs) that are extensively used in underground advertising. We show that the adversary today's strategically constructs the APPIs to evade explicit content detection while still preserving their sexual appeal, even though the distortions and noise introduced are clearly observable to humans. To understand such real-world adversarial images and the underground business behind them, we develop a novel DP-based methodology called Male`na, which focuses on the regions of an image where sexual content is least obfuscated and therefore visible to the target audience of a promotion. Using this technique, we have discovered over 4,000 APPIs from 4,042,690 images crawled from popular social media, and further brought to light the unique techniques they use to evade popular explicit content detectors (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API, Yahoo Open NSFW model), and the reason that these techniques work. Also studied are the ecosystem of such illicit promotions, including the obfuscated contacts advertised through those images, compromised accounts used to disseminate them, and large APPI campaigns involving thousands of images. Another interesting finding is the apparent attempt made by cybercriminals to steal others' images for their advertising. The study highlights the importance of the research on real-world adversarial learning and makes the first step towards mitigating the threats it poses.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835391/,2019 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),19-23 May 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/IACC.2016.111,Sybil Detection in Online Social Networks (OSNs),IEEE,Conferences,"Peer to peer and distributed systems are generally susceptible to sybil attacks. Online social networks (OSNs), due to their fat user base and open access nature are also prone to such attacks. Current state-of-art algorithms for sybil attack detection make use of the inherent social graph created among registered users of OSN service. They rely on the inherent trust relationship among these users. No effort is made to combine other characteristic behavior of sybil users with properties of social graph of OSNs to improve detection accuracy of sybil attacks. Sybil identities are also used as gateways for spreading spam content in OSNs. The proposed approach exploits this behavior of sybil users to improve detection accuracy of existing sybil detection algorithms. In the proposed approach, content generated/published by each user is used along with the topological properties of the social graph of registered users. A machine learning model is used for assigning a fractional value called ""trust value"" which denotes the amount of legitimate content generated by the user. A modification to sybil detection algorithm is proposed which makes use of the trust value of each user to improve the accuracy of detecting a sybil identity. Real dataset from Facebook is crawled and used for analysis and experiments. Analytical results show the superiority of proposed solution. Results are compared with SybilGuard and SybilShield which shows ~14% decrease in false positive rates with very minimal effect on acceptance rate or false negative rate of the sybil detection algorithms. Also, the proposed modification does not affect the performance of existing sybil detection algorithms and can be implemented in a distributed manner.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7544900/,2016 IEEE 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing (IACC),27-28 Feb. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057066,SybilSCAR: Sybil detection in online social networks via local rule based propagation,IEEE,Conferences,"Detecting Sybils in online social networks (OSNs) is a fundamental security research problem as adversaries can leverage Sybils to perform various malicious activities. Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified into two categories: Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits their detection accuracy, and they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not scalable, and they cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a new structure-based method to perform Sybil detection in OSNs. SybilSCAR maintains the advantages of existing methods while overcoming their limitations. Specifically, SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to label noises. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with a state-of-the-art RW-based method and a state-of-the-art LBP-based method, using both synthetic Sybils and large-scale social network datasets with real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that SybilSCAR is more accurate and more robust to label noise than the compared state-of-the-art RW-based method, and that SybilSCAR is orders of magnitude more scalable than the state-of-the-art LBP-based method and is guaranteed to converge.

State-of-the-art TCF methods employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model such aspects. These methods deploy matrix-factorization-based (MF -based) approaches to learn the user and item representations. Recently, graph-neural-network-based (GNN-based) approaches have shown improved performance in providing accurate recommendations over traditional MF -based approaches in non-temporal CF settings. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TCF method that leverages GNNs to learn user and item representations, and RNNs to model their temporal dynamics. A challenge with this method lies in the increased data sparsity, which negatively impacts obtaining meaningful quality representations with GNNs. To overcome this challenge, we train a GNN model at each time step using a set of observed interactions accumulated time-wise. Comprehensive experiments on real-world data show the improved performance obtained by our method over several state-of-the-art temporal and non-temporal CF models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413200/,2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10-15 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207151,Temporal Fusion Pointer network-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Multi-Objective Workflow Scheduling in the cloud,IEEE,Conferences,"Cloud computing is emerging as a deployment promising environment for hosting exponentially increasing scientific and social media applications, but how to manage and execute these applications efficiently depends mainly on workflow scheduling. However, scheduling workflows in the cloud is an NP-hard problem and its existing solutions have certain limitations when applied to real-world scenarios. In this paper, a Temporal Fusion Pointer network-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm for multi-objective workflow scheduling (TFP-RL) is proposed. Through adopting reinforcement learning, our algorithm can discover its heuristics over time by continuous learning according to the rewards resulting from good scheduling solutions. To make more comprehensive scheduling decisions as the influence of historical actions, a novel temporal fusion pointer network (TFP) is designed for the reinforcement learning agent, which can improve the quality of our resulting solutions and the ability of our algorithm in dealing with versatile workflow applications. To decrease convergence time, we train the proposed TFP-RL model independently by the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic method and use its resulting model for scheduling workflows. Finally, under a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, a Pareto dominance-oriented criterion for reasonable action selection is established for a multi-objective optimization scenario. We first train our TFP-RL model by taking randomly generated workflows as inputs to validate its effectiveness in scheduling, then compare our trained model with other existing scheduling approaches through practical compute- and data-intensive workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarking ones in terms of different metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207151/,2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),19-24 July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICARSC.2015.19,Testing a Fully Autonomous Robotic Salesman in Real Scenarios,IEEE,Conferences,"Over the past decades, the number of robots deployed in museums, trade shows and exhibitions have grown steadily. This new application domain has become a key research topic in the robotics community. Therefore, new robots are designed to interact with people in these domains, using natural and intuitive channels. Visual perception and speech processing have to be considered for these robots, as they should be able to detect people in their environment, recognize their degree of accessibility and engage them in social conversations. They also need to safely navigate around dynamic, uncontrolled environments. They must be equipped with planning and learning components, that allow them to adapt to different scenarios. Finally, they must attract the attention of the people, be kind and safe to interact with.

In this paper, we present the background of adaptive role-based models, and then focus on the design of this Epsilon model and its language.

With this translation scheme, we implemented a practical syntax translator as a preprocessor of EpsilonJ program, through lexical analysis and parsing. To utilize this translator, we also propose an interactive framework prototype for EpsilonJ program development and execution, and developed as a web-based application tool, by deploying this EpsilonJ translator as a core component.

We present results of an experiment in which 28 infants (average age 10 months) interacted for a 3 minute period with a non-humanoid robot. For half the infants the robot simulated contingency structure typically produced by human beings. In particular it provided causal information about the existence of a line of regard. For the other 14 infants, the robot behaved in a manner which was not contingent with the environment. We found that a few minutes of interaction with the contingent robot was sufficient to elicit statistically detectable gaze following. There were clear signs that some of these infants were actively attempting to identify whether or not the robot was responsive to them. We propose that the infant brain is equipped to learn and analyze the contingency structure of real-time social interactions.

10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109799,The power of cognitive computing: An example of cognitive dynamic regional development modeling,IEEE,Conferences,"This presentation concerns some idea of what could be done, in the author's view, to help make Wang's cognitive informatics a powerful and viable source of tools and techniques for solving various real life problems. First, we give a brief account of cognitive informatics meant as a multidisciplinary field within informatics, or computer science, that is based on results of cognitive and information sciences, and which deals with human information processing mechanisms and processes and their decision theoretic, engineering, etc. applications in broadly perceived computing. We focus on its purpose, i.e. to develop and implement technologies to facilitate and extend the information acquisition, comprehension and processing capacity of humans. Emphasis is on underlying processes in the brain. However, we advocate an extended approach in which though the very cognitive informatics is the foundation, as those processes in the brain are crucial, some sort of an “outer” cognitive informatics is needed which explicitly makes reference not what proceeds “internally” in the brain, because we do not “see” this, but “externally”, i.e. what people can see, judge, evaluate, etc., and what is clearly a result of cognitive information specific processes in the brain. This line of reasoning is in line with the very essence of comprehension, memorizing, learning, choice and decision making, satisfaction with partial truth, allowing for not perfect solutions, etc. dealt with using tools and techniques derived from many areas like psychology, behavioral science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroeconomics etc. In our case, we will concentrate on some cognitive informatics type elements that mostly have been inspired by psychology and behavioral sciences, as our problem is inherently related to human judgments and perceptions, but we will mentioned some inspirations from neuroscience, notably along the lines of neuroeconomics. Cognitive informatics constitutes a foundation of its related new field, cognitive computing, which is basically a new direction in broadly perceived intelligent computing and systems that synergistically combines results from many areas, e.g., information science, computational sciences, computer science, artificial and computational intelligence, cybernetics, systems science, cognitive science, (neuro)psychology, brain science, linguistics, etc. to just mention a few. We try to show on an example of a dynamic systems modeling, more specifically scenario based regional development planning, that cognitive computing can provide new conceptual and implementation vistas. Basically, we consider a region that is characterized by 7 life quality indicators related to economic, social, environmental, etc. qualities, which evolve over some planning horizon due to some investments, mostly by some regional or governmental agencies. There are some scenarios of investment levels over the planning horizon, meant for the development of the particular life quality indexes, and some desired levels of these indexes, both objective, i.e. set by authorities, and subjective, i.e. perceived by the inhabitant groups. As a result of a particular investment scenario, the life quality indexes evolve over the planning horizon, and their temporal evolution is evaluated by the authorities and inhabitants. This evaluation has both an objective, i.e. against the “officially” set thresholds, and subjective, i.e. as perceived by various humans and their groups. Basically, we employ Kacprzyk's fuzzy dynamic programming based approach to the modeling and planning/programming of sustainable regional development, with soft constraints and goals, but we advocated a more sophisticated assessment of variability, stability, balancedness of consecutive investments. In this process we try to develop evaluation measures, and then the optimization type model using concepts that can be effectively and efficiently handled by cognitive computing, notably the inclusion of the so called decision making and behavioral biases, biases in probability and belief, social biases, memory errors, etc. Moreover, we strongly reflect the so called status quo and minimal change biases. By using many results from social sciences, psychology, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, etc. on human judgments and human centric evaluations, we augment a traditional purely effectiveness and efficiency oriented analysis by a more sophisticated analysis of effects of variability of temporal evolution of some life quality indicators on the human perception of its goodness. The model presented, which has been employed for years as part of large mathematical modeling projects for sustainable regional development in many regions in Asia and Europe, is illustrated on an example with scenario analysis for a rural region plagued by social and economic difficulties in which subsidies should properly be distributed over time to obtain a best overall socioeconomic effect. In this talk we present the model in a different perspective, based first on the basic Wang's cognitive informatics and its Wang and Ruhe's decision making application, and then based on new, more comprehensive cognitive computing.

10.23919/FRUCT52173.2021.9435451,Towards Automatic Modelling of Thematic Domains of a National Literature: Technical Issues in the Case of Russian,IEEE,Conferences,"A significant part of modern technologies associated with the development of artificial intelligence systems and digital analytics of diverse data relies on methods of computer text processing (NLP, speech technologies). However, NLP methods are applied primarily to specialized texts, such as scientific literature, technical documentation, news, etc., or social media discourse. Fiction texts are usually left out of the focus of NLP practitioners as the fictional world seems to be of less significance or less “information value” from a practical point of view. Moreover, due to the poetic and metaphorical nature of literary texts, the use of some NLP methods (e.g., topic modelling) for fiction analysis turned out to be more complicated. At the same time, the influence of literature both on the consciousness of individuals and on the formation of social values can hardly be overestimated. Besides, making computers “understand” fiction in a similar way as humans do would be a real challenge for artificial intelligence. The article puts forward the idea of modelling thematic areas of literature on a national scale, which should reveal the main thematic domains of national literature as a whole. It will allow a better understanding of the cultural traits of the national consciousness in a given historical period and contribute to either literary studies or practical tasks. Methodological approaches to determining and modelling themes of literary works are considered, technical difficulties arising in the process are described, and the ways to solve them are suggested. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the design of the corpus of Russian short stories of 1900-1930s and can be applied in the development of artificial intelligence systems that process large volumes of literary texts in any language.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9435451/,2021 29th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),12-14 May 2021,ieeexplore

In human-robot collaboration, this is an essential requisite for long-term time-dependent navigation and not losing sight of the person during momentary occlusions that may arise from a crowd due to static or dynamic obstacles, other human beings, or intersections in the local surrounding. The PFR must not only traverse to the previously unknown goal position but also relocate the target person after the miss, and resume following. In this paper, we try to solve this as a coupled motion-planning and control problem by formulating a model predictive control (MPC) controller with non-linear constraints for a wheeled differential-drive robot. And, using a human motion prediction strategy based on the recorded pose and trajectory information of both the moving target person and the PFR, add additional constraints to the same MPC, to recompute the optimal controls to the wheels. We make comparisons with RNNs like LSTM and Early Relocation for learning the best-predicted reference path.MPC is best suited for complex constrained problems because it allows the PFR to periodically update the tracking information, as well as to adapt to the moving person’s stride. We show the results using a simulated indoor environment and lay the foundation for its implementation on a real robot.

It brings the opportunity to use universal big data for further computation that may deliver new insights and automation system. The technology that enables this work is artificial intelligence (AI). As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-to-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-to-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-to-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9255497/,2020 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security (IWBIS),17-18 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/CCGrid.2015.74,Towards a Realistic Scheduler for Mixed Workloads with Workflows,IEEE,Conferences,"Many fields of modern science require huge amounts of computation, and workflows are a very popular tool in e-Science since they allow to organize many small, simple tasks to solve big problems. They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhDresearch is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types. We are in the process of simulating policies, and we will validate our results by means of an implementation and real-world experiments with the KOALA-Workflow processing system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7152549/,"2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",4-7 May 2015,ieeexplore

These physical objects, generally referred to as the smart objects, when deployed in real-world aggregates useful information from their surrounding environment. As-of-late, this notion of IoT has been extended to incorporate the social networking facets which have led to the promising paradigm of the `Social Internet of Things' (SIoT). In SIoT, the devices operate as an autonomous agent and provide an exchange of information and services discovery in an intelligent manner by establishing social relationships among them with respect to their owners. Trust plays an important role in establishing trustworthy relationships among the physical objects and reduces probable risks in the decision making process. In this paper, a trust computational model is proposed to extract individual trust features in a SIoT environment. Furthermore, a machine learning-based heuristic is used to aggregate all the trust features in order to ascertain an aggregate trust score. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed trust-based model isolates the trustworthy and untrustworthy nodes within the network in an efficient manner.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9148767/,ICC 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),7-11 June 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ASONAM49781.2020.9381325,TrustGCN: Enabling Graph Convolutional Network for Robust Sybil Detection in OSNs,IEEE,Conferences,"Detecting fake accounts (also called Sybils) is a fundamental security problem in online social networks (OSNs). Existing feature-based or social-graph-based approaches suffer from the key limitations: they can only leverage either node feature or graph structure properties such as fast-mixing and conductance, but not both. To overcome this shortcoming, we explore the introduction of recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data into Sybil detection field. These types of models enable integrating both user-level activities and graph-level structures for a new generation of feature-and-graph-based detection mechanisms. However, we find that although applying Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective against naïve attacks, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which fake accounts alter local edges and features with patterns to resemble real users. In this paper, we present TrustGCN, a Sybil-resilient defense algorithm that combines the idea of social-graph-based defense with GCN. TrustGCN first assigns trust scores to nodes based on the landing probability of short random walks that starts from known real accounts. As this short, supervised random walk is likely to stay within the subgraph consisting of real accounts, most real accounts receive higher trust scores than fakes. Then it introduces these trust scores as edge weights and adopts graph convolution operations to aggregate features of local graph neighborhoods over this weighted graph for classification. In this way, we prevent Sybil partners with low trust scores from contributing to the feature aggregation for a target node, thus is more robust against adverse manipulations of the attackers. Our experiment on real data demonstrates that TrustGCN significantly outperforms GCN in the robustness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine social-graph-based defenses with graph neural networks into a unified model, paving the way for the robust feature-and-graph-based detection mechanisms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9381325/,2020 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM),7-10 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

As of 2017, Twitter's outreach is over 317M monthly active users generating more than 320M tweets every day, thus making it one of the fastest information deployment mediums of this era. In order to aid data distribution without causing a glut of information to the users, we develop a recommender system focusing on a vital aspect of social media - relationships among users, addressing a popular problem of users - who to follow/befriend? By choosing the right accounts and users to follow, the sources of information can be controlled as desired. The information collected from the most recent tweets of a user is used to find other users whose recent tweets contain similar information, ensuring there is at least one mutual friend among users. By making use of the continuous and real time updating of data on social networks, we develop a method to ensure our training sets consist of relevant information for classification, thus preserving accuracy while reducing training set sizes for probabilistic learning models. We use two algorithms to detect tweets of common topics, namely a Noun Phrase detector and a Naïve Bayes Text (Topic) Classifier and further compare their complexity and accuracy. The Naive Bayes Classifier, despite being probabilistic, functioned well with a relatively small training set. This is only with the exception of Twitter as it is a real-time updating framework. Exact matches were hard to obtain with the Noun phrase detector, as we are going only one level deep due to limited compute. However, when matches were found, it is upto 90% accurate. Experiments on tweets of random public users have found that Naive Bayes Classifier with a small but recent training data set can work as well as or better than a Collaborative filter without the assumptions of the Collaborative model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8272631/,2017 International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science(ICCIDS),2-3 June 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/DSC.2018.00023,ULE: Learning User and Location Embeddings for POI Recommendation,IEEE,Conferences,"Point-of Interest recommendation has become an important application in Location-Based Social Networks. It recommends interesting but unvisited locations for users based on users' historical check-ins and other auxiliary information. To cope with check-ins, existing methods convert them into users' scores on Points-of-interest and fit the scores by users' and locations' latent factors. However, the way of conversion is not appropriate since check-ins are just repeated times, which have no clear correspondence with users' explicit preferences. To cope with auxiliary information, including geographical positions, social connections, etc., existing methods develop many different ways. However, most of them handle each type of auxiliary information separately, and they cannot combine different types of auxiliary information easily and closely in one model. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Point-of-Interest recommendation which can overcome the two challenges. The framework is composed of two parts, corresponding to the modeling of check-ins and other auxiliary information respectively. First, we split the check-in into check-in relationship and a confidence in the relationship. Considering that one user's preferences to all Points-of-Interest are mutually influenced, we adopt a multinomial distribution to model each user's preferences distribution. Second, we argue that the influences of each type of auxiliary information can be reflected in the interactions of any pair of users or locations. For example, geographical influences are reflected in two locations which are geographically close to each other. We adopt multinomial distribution to model the distribution of each location's (user's) influences on other locations (users), forming a unified framework with the modeling of check-ins. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world data sets, i.e., Foursquare and Gowalla.

The prediction of the individual future academic impact is beneficial to detecting talented scholars and allocating the academic resources more reasonably. Recently, many evaluation indicators based on academic impact have been proposed, among which the G-index is more objective than the citations and H-index that used more frequently. At present, the main contradiction is formed between the great values of the individual future academic impact in practice and the imperfect evaluation and prediction methods. In order to solve this contradiction, this paper chooses the objective and comprehensive evaluation indicator G-index to measure individual academic impact and proposes the solution of how to predict the G-index at a given time interval for the first time in relevant research fields. Firstly, different characteristic features are extracted based on the structure of the academic social network. Then, a prediction model based on deep learning is proposed to learn the function mapping relationship between the future G-index time with the current feature set. Finally, the proposed model is validated with real academic social network dataset. The experiment results show that the individual G-index development is tightly related to the scholar's characteristic features in the current academic social network and the deep learning model performs well in predicting the future G index.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9069370/,2019 IEEE Fourth International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC),23-25 June 2019,ieeexplore

Consequently, the approach is arbitrarily scalable, adapts to exogenous disturbances, and is robust to failures of individual agents. This algorithm is an example of a decentralized primal-space algorithm for constrained non-linear optimization that achieves coordination between agents using stigmergic memory cues present in the physical system as opposed to explicit communication and synchronization. Not only does this work make of stigmergy, a property first used to describe decentralized decision making in eusocial insects, but details of the algorithm are inspired by classic social foraging theory and more recent results in eusocial-insect macronutrient regulation. This theoretical analysis in this paper guarantees that the decentralized stigmergically coupled system converges to within a finite neighborhood of the optimal resource allocation. These results are validated using a hardware implementation of the algorithm in a small-scale intelligent lighting scenario. There are other real-time distributed resource allocation applications that are amenable to these methods, like distributed power generation, in general, this paper means to provide proof of concept that physical variables in cyberphysical systems can be leveraged to reduce the communication burden of algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6969416/,2014 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops,19-23 May 2014,ieeexplore

10.1109/CloudCom.2011.21,iHadoop: Asynchronous Iterations for MapReduce,IEEE,Conferences,"MapReduce is a distributed programming framework designed to ease the development of scalable data-intensive applications for large clusters of commodity machines. Most machine learning and data mining applications involve iterative computations over large datasets, such as the Web hyperlink structures and social network graphs. Yet, the MapReduce model does not efficiently support this important class of applications. The architecture of MapReduce, most critically its dataflow techniques and task scheduling, is completely unaware of the nature of iterative applications, tasks are scheduled according to a policy that optimizes the execution for a single iteration which wastes bandwidth, I/O, and CPU cycles when compared with an optimal execution for a consecutive set of iterations. This work presents iHadoop, a modified MapReduce model, and an associated implementation, optimized for iterative computations. The iHadoop model schedules iterations asynchronously. It connects the output of one iteration to the next, allowing both to process their data concurrently. iHadoop's task scheduler exploits inter-iteration data locality by scheduling tasks that exhibit a producer/consumer relation on the same physical machine allowing a fast local data transfer. For those iterative applications that require satisfying certain criteria before termination, iHadoop runs the check concurrently during the execution of the subsequent iteration to further reduce the application's latency. This paper also describes our implementation of the iHadoop model, and evaluates its performance against Hadoop, the widely used open source implementation of MapReduce. Experiments using different data analysis applications over real-world and synthetic datasets show that iHadoop performs better than Hadoop for iterative algorithms, reducing execution time of iterative applications by 25% on average. Furthermore, integrating iHadoop with HaLoop, a variant Hadoop implementation that caches invariant data between iterations, reduces execution time by 38% on average.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133130/,2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2011,ieeexplore

This fact has favored the development of personal or social robots, which are expected to behave in a natural way. This implies that these robots could meet certain requirements, for example, to be able to decide their own actions (autonomy), to be able to make deliberative plans (reasoning), or to be able to have an emotional behavior in order to facilitate human-robot interaction. In this paper, the authors present a bioinspired control architecture for an autonomous and social robot, which tries to accomplish some of these features. In order to develop this new architecture, authors have used as a base a prior hybrid control architecture (AD) that is also biologically inspired. Nevertheless, in the later, the task to be accomplished at each moment is determined by a fix sequence processed by the Main Sequencer. Therefore, the main sequencer of the architecture coordinates the previously programmed sequence of skills that must be executed. In the new architecture, the main sequencer is substituted by a decision making system based on drives, motivations, emotions, and self-learning, which decides the proper action at every moment according to robot's state.

Many people have lost their jobs, relationships, and are stalked because of online privacy breaches. This situation is even more disturbing for young teens as they are in the process of learning emotional, social, and physical behaviors. Online predators take advantage of their immaturity and raise various threats to teens including aggression, rape, abduction, physical and emotional sadistic torture, and even human trafficking. Teens, on the other hand, do not have any mechanism to protect them against such threats. Therefore, this research addresses this overlooked need and proposes a trust model for the teen community, which can evaluate the trustworthiness of a stranger based on teens' psychological and social needs.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2979012,A Dynamic Bayesian Network Approach for Analysing Topic-Sentiment Evolution,IEEE,Journals,"Sentiment analysis is one of the key tasks of natural language understanding. Sentiment Evolution models the dynamics of sentiment orientation over time. It can help people have a more profound and deep understanding of opinion and sentiment implied in user generated content. Existing work mainly focuses on sentiment classification, while the analysis of how the sentiment orientation of a topic has been influenced by other topics or the dynamic interaction of topics from the aspect of sentiment has been ignored. In this paper, we propose to construct a Gaussian Process Dynamic Bayesian Network to model the dynamics and interactions of the sentiment of topics on social media such as Twitter. We use Dynamic Bayesian Networks to model time series of the sentiment of related topics and learn relationships between them. The network model itself applies Gaussian Process Regression to model the sentiment at a given time point based on related topics at previous time. We conducted experiments on a real world dataset that was crawled from Twitter with 9.72 million tweets.

Although trajectory data is of great value to many applications, it is challenging to analyze and mine trajectory data due to the complex characteristics reflected in human mobility, which is affected by multiple contextual information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Context Trajectory Embedding Model, called MC-TEM, to explore contexts in a systematic way. MC-TEM is developed in the distributed representation learning framework, and it is flexible to characterize various kinds of useful contexts for different applications. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed representation learning methods apply to trajectory data. We formally incorporate multiple context information of trajectory data into the proposed model, including user-level, trajectory-level, location-level, and temporal contexts. All the context information is represented in the same embedding space. We apply MC-TEM to two challenging tasks, namely location recommendation and social link prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Extensive experiment results have demonstrated the superiority of our MC-TEM model over several state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7447767/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2016,ieeexplore

Fortunately, there is a lot of information that we can use. We can make recommendations by mining the rich information hidden in user check-in records. In this paper, we propose a recommend system named GFP-LORE. Specifically, we have designed a framework, which integrates various influencing factors. First, we modeled friend sign-in frequencies and POI popularity as a power-law distribution and the experiment proved that it is effective. Then, we got the influence of geographic information by modeling it according to the longitude and latitude of the user's check-in location. After that, we sorted the historical check-in records of all users according to time and then mine an overall pattern of location transfer-order pattern. Then, we combine it with each user's own unique location transfer record to get the possibility of the user going to the next POI. Finally, we synthesize the above four influence factors into a unified correlation probability rating and recommend a new location by this probability rating.

In the application of swarm intelligence to real micro mobile robots, the deployment of a single virtual pheromone has emerged recently as a powerful real-time method for indirect communication. However, these studies usually exploit only one kind of pheromones in their task, neglecting the crucial fact that in the world of real insects, multiple pheromones play important roles in shaping stigmergic behaviors such as foraging or nest building. To explore the multiple pheromones mechanism which enable robots to solve complex collective tasks efficiently, we introduce an artificial multiple pheromone system (ColCOS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Phi $ </tex-math></inline-formula>) to support swarm intelligence research by enabling multiple robots to deploy and react to multiple pheromones simultaneously. The proposed system ColCOS<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\Phi $ </tex-math></inline-formula> uses optical signals to emulate different evaporating chemical substances i.e. pheromones. These emulated pheromones are represented by trails displayed on a wide LCD display screen positioned horizontally, on which multiple miniature robots can move freely. The color sensors beneath the robots can detect and identify lingering “pheromones” on the screen. Meanwhile, the release of any pheromone from each robot is enabled by monitoring its positional information over time with an overhead camera. No other communication methods apart from virtual pheromones are employed in this system. Two case studies have been carried out which have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system in achieving complex swarm tasks as empowered by multiple pheromones.

Influence maximization is the problem of finding k nodes that maximize the influence spread in a specific social network. Robust influence maximization is a novel topic that focuses on the uncertainty factors among the influence propagation models and algorithms. It aims to find a seed set with a definite size that has robust performance with different influence functions under various uncertainty factors. In this paper, we propose a centrality-based edge activation probability evaluation method in the independent cascade model.

We also propose two algorithms, called NewDiscount and GreedyCIC, by incorporating the edge probability space into previous algorithms. With extensive experiments on various real online social network data sets, we find that our PageRank-based greedy algorithm has the best influence spreads and lowest running times, compared with other algorithms, on some large data sets.

Since the number and size of the networks modeled by graphs grow larger and larger, some level of parallelism needs to be used, to reduce the computational costs of such massive applications. Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (referred to as lists on Facebook and Twitter), while users, based on their interests, place themselves into groups of interest. However, the community detection and is a very effortful procedure, and in addition, these communities need to be updated very often, resulting in more effort. In this paper, we combine parallel processing techniques with a typical data structure like threaded binary trees to detect communities in an efficient manner.

Due to the limited length of each short text, word co-occurrence information in this type of documents is sparse. Conventional topic models based on word co-occurrence are unable to distill coherent topics on short texts. A state-of-the-art strategy is self-aggregated topic models which implicitly aggregate short texts into latent long documents. But these models have two problems. One problem is that the number of long documents should be defined explicitly and the inappropriate number leads to poor performance. Another problem is that latent long documents may bring non-semantic word co-occurrence which brings incoherent topics. In this article, we firstly apply the Chinese restaurant process to automatically generate the number of long documents according to the scale of short texts. Then to exclude non-semantic word co-occurrence, we propose a novel probabilistic model generating latent long documents in a more semantically way. Specifically, our model employs a pitman-yor process to aggregate short texts into long documents. This stochastic process can guarantee that the distribution between short texts and long documents following a power-law distribution which can be found in social media like Twitter.

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification.

The cloth model is trained using observations from a motion capture system and depth sensor. MRD provides a principled probabilistic framework for inferring the accurate motion-capture state when only the noisy depth sensor feature state is available in real time.

Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications.

On the other hand, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a favorable way to locally process SIoT data for reducing data transmission and computation among SIoT devices and backhaul networks. Nevertheless, the load sharing among SIoT devices, MEC, and remote servers brings about new challenges for the communication and computation tradeoff, cross-layer design in SIoT, and forwarding and aggregation tradeoff. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, SIoT collaborative group and device selection problem (SCGDSP), and prove the NP-hardness. We first explore the intrinsic properties of a fundamental SCGDSP case by finding the optimal collaborative group for each user request. Then, we design an approximation algorithm for the general SCGDSP that first evaluates candidate collaborative groups under different social relations, and then selects the collaborative groups and SIoT devices properly. For scalability, the proposed algorithm also supports dynamic user requests and can be distributionally deployed in massive networks enabling collaborative MEC. Moreover, it also sustains local SIoT services, where the computation only involves SIoT devices and MEC servers. Simulation results demonstrate that effective SIoT and collaborative group selection (ESCGS) can reduce by more than 50% of the total communication and computation costs compared with baseline schemes in the real networks from topology zoo.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019.

10.1109/TAC.2019.2955999,Distributed Mechanism Design With Learning Guarantees for Private and Public Goods Problems,IEEE,Journals,"Mechanism design for fully strategic agents typically assumes that agents broadcast their messages to a central authority that performs allocation and taxes/subsidizes agents. In addition, most of the designed mechanisms do not provide any guarantees that the Nash equilibrium (NE) will be reached asymptotically. Whenever such results are provided, they refer to convergence of specific predesigned learning dynamics and it is assumed that agents will follow such prescription. Both assumptions are an impediment in practical application of mechanism design in real-life allocation problems. In this article, we consider two common resource allocation problems: sharing K infinitely divisible resources among strategic agents for their private consumption (private goods), and determining the level for an infinitely divisible public good with P features, that is shared between strategic agents. For both cases, we present a distributed mechanism for a set of agents who communicate through a given network. In a distributed mechanism, agents' messages are not broadcasted to all other agents as in the standard mechanism design framework, but are exchanged only in the local neighborhood of each agent. The presented mechanisms produce a unique NE, they fully implement the social welfare maximizing allocation, and are budget-balanced at NE. Subsequently, it is shown that the mechanisms induce a game with contractive best-response, leading to guaranteed convergence for all learning dynamics within the adaptive best-response dynamics class, including dynamics such as Cournot best-response, k-period best-response, and Fictitious Play. While the abovementioned mechanisms have message dimensionality that grows quadratically with the number of agents, we show that if one is willing to forgo the strong convergence guarantees, it is possible to design a distributed mechanism with total message space dimensionality growing only linearly with the number of agents. Finally, we demonstrate the abovementioned results through a numerical study of convergence under repeated play, for various communication graphs and learning dynamics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8913590/,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968220,Dtree2vec: A High-Accuracy and Dynamic Scheme for Real-Time Book Recommendation by Serialized Chapters and Local Fine-Grained Partitioning,IEEE,Journals,"With the rapid development of social computing technologies and online reading platforms, the proportion of e-books, especially online serialized novels, has been increasing. Identifying ways to add updated serialized books to readers' real-time recommendation lists has become an urgent problem to be solved. While serialized books are still underwritten and in the process of production, their features and categories can constantly evolve and change, lacking complete text content information and complete global scoring data. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic DTree2Vec scheme for serialized books that models text of varying degrees of completion to achieve unified semantic feature representation to measure the semantic relevance of books. At the same time, it ensures recommendation quality by tracking the update status of serialized books and by adding the subsequent chapter content in real time. This scheme establishes a dynamic hierarchical tree structure for serialized books and applies a cosine-type local reconstruction model to reconstruct new semantic features of books. In addition, the fine-grained factor of chapter partitioning is introduced to the reconstruction process to adjust the proportion of global and local features to better represent the semantic features of books. We analyzed effects of the content of serialized chapters on the recommendation results and used semantic features of the reconstruction to represent the content of serial novels in real time. The experiment results prove that the proposed DTree2Vec scheme can achieve higher degrees of recommendation accuracy when dealing with unfinished serialized books, effectively alleviating dynamic capture problems and real-time recommendations of book recommendations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8970611/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage, limiting the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential of social influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade ago, researchers started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The challenge is to find the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to maximise the influence spread in networks. In typical approach we will activate all seeds in single stage, at the beginning of the process, while in this work we introduce and evaluate a new approach for seeds activation in temporal networks based on sequential seeding. Instead of activating all nodes at the same time, this method distributes the activations of seeds, leading to higher ranges of influence spread. The results of experiments performed using real and randomised networks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms single stage seeding in 71% of cases by nearly 6% on average.

Altruistic tendencies, intended to benefit others with no apparent rewards, are also very useful for social robots that are designed to be used in our households. Yet, to make robots capable of learning how to help others as infants do, it is important to understand the mechanisms and motives responsible for the development of altruistic behavior. Further, understanding the mechanisms behind the early development of pro-social behavior would be a great contribution to the field of developmental psychology. To these ends, we hypothesize that infants from 14 months of age help others to minimize the differences between predicted actions and observations, that is, to minimize prediction errors. To evaluate our hypothesis, we created a computational model based on psychological studies and implemented it in real and simulated robots. Our system first acquires its own sensory-motor representation by interacting with its environment. Then, using its experience, the system recognizes and predicts others' actions and uses this prediction to estimate a prediction error.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared.

They can be found in several fields, ranging from the Internet to social sciences, biology, epidemiology, geography, finance, and many others. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for the analysis of network data, but they usually focus on homogeneous networks, where all the objects are of the same type, and links among them describe a single type of relationship. More recently, the complexity of real scenarios has impelled researchers to design methods for the analysis of heterogeneous networks, especially focused on classification and clustering tasks. However, they often make assumptions on the structure of the network that are too restrictive or do not fully exploit different forms of network correlation and autocorrelation. Moreover, when nodes which are the main subject of the classification task are linked to several nodes of the network having missing values, standard methods can lead to either building incomplete classification models or to discarding possibly relevant dependencies (correlation or autocorrelation). In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning approach for multi-type classification. We adopt the system Mr-SBC, which is originally able to analyze heterogeneous networks of arbitrary structure, within an ensemble learning approach. The ensemble allows us to improve the classification accuracy of Mr-SBC by exploiting i) the possible presence of correlation and autocorrelation phenomena and ii) the classification of instances (which contain missing values) of other node types in the network. As a beneficial side effect, we have also that the models are more stable in terms of standard deviation of the accuracy, over different samples used for training. Experiments performed on real-world datasets show that the proposed method is able to significantly outperform the standard implementation of Mr-SBC. Moreover, it gives Mr-SBC the advantage of outperforming four other well-known algorithms for the classification of data organized in a network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8329517/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

Previous works mainly focus on estimating SEAs from peoples' cyberspace behaviors and relationships, such as the content of tweets or the social networks between online users. Besides cyberspace data, alternative data sources about users' physical behavior, like their home location, may offer new insights. More specifically, in this paper, we study how to predict a person's income level, family income level, occupation type, and education level from his/her home location. As a case study, we collect people's home locations and socioeconomic attributes through a survey involving 9 provinces and 85 cities in China. We further enrich home location with the knowledge from real estate websites, government statistics websites, online map services, etc. To learn a shared representation from input features as well as attribute-specific representations for different SEAs, we propose H2SEA, a factorization machine-based multi-task learning method with attention mechanism. Extensive experiment results show that: (1) Home location can clearly improve the estimation accuracy for all SEA prediction tasks (e.g., 80.2% improvement in terms of F1-score in estimating personal income level); (2) The proposed H2SEA model outperforms alternative models for SEA inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as Area Under Curve (AUC), F-measure, and specificity; (3) The performance of specific SEA prediction tasks (e.g., personal income) can be further improved if H2SEA only focuses on cities or villages due to urban-rural gap in China; (4) Compared with online crawled housing price data, the area-level average income and Points Of Interest (POI) are more important features for SEA inferences in China.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355035/,Journal of Social Computing,March 2021,ieeexplore

Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdös-Rényi random network and the Barabási-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large.

To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk.

The proposed 2D landmark feature map (LFM) is obtained by transforming conventional coordinate-based landmark information into 2D image information. LFM is designed to have an advantageous property independent of the intensity of facial expression change.

Video data is a rich source of information and considered the most demanding in terms of storage space. With the huge development of digital video production, video management becomes a challenging task. Video content analysis (VCA) aims to provide big data solutions by automating the video management. To this end, shot boundary detection (SBD) is considered an essential step in VCA. It aims to partition the video sequence into shots by detecting shot transitions. High computational cost in transition detection is considered a bottleneck for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, a balance between detection accuracy and speed for SBD is addressed by presenting a new method for fast video processing. The proposed SBD framework is based on the concept of candidate segment selection with frame active area and separable moments. First, for each frame, the active area is selected such that only the informative content is considered. This leads to a reduction in the computational cost and disturbance factors. Second, for each active area, the moments are computed using orthogonal polynomials. Then, an adaptive threshold and inequality criteria are used to eliminate most of the non-transition frames and preserve candidate segments. For further elimination, two rounds of bisection comparisons are applied. As a result, the computational cost is reduced in the subsequent stages. Finally, machine learning statistics based on the support vector machine is implemented to detect the cut transitions. The enhancement of the proposed fast video processing method over existing methods in terms of computational complexity and accuracy is verified. The average improvements in terms of frame percentage and transition accuracy percentage are 1.63% and 2.05%, respectively. Moreover, for the proposed SBD algorithm, a comparative study is performed with state-of-the-art algorithms.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909843,Intelligent Service Recommendation for Cold-Start Problems in Edge Computing,IEEE,Journals,"Memory-based collaborative filtering (i.e., MCF) is regarded as an effective technique to recommend appropriate services to target users. However, if recommendation data are very sparse in the edge environment, traditional MCF-based recommendation methods probably cannot output any recommended item (or service), i.e., a cold-start recommendation problem occurs. To cope with this cold-start problem, we propose an intelligent recommendation method named Inverse_CF_Rec. Concretely, for a target user, we first search for his/her opposite users (together referred to as “enemy” hereafter); afterward, we infer the possible friends of the target user indirectly according to Social Balance Theory; finally, optimal services are recommended to the target user based on the derived possible friends of the target user. The experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset WS-DREAM to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. The experiment results show the advantages of our recommendation method in terms of recommendation accuracy and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8684189/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Thanks to the high penetration of smartphones, social media users are increasingly going mobile. This trend has contributed to foster various location based services deployed on social media, the success of which heavily depends on the availability and accuracy of users' location information. However, only a very small fraction of tweets in Twitter are geo-tagged. Therefore, it is necessary to infer locations for tweets in order to attain the purpose of those location based services. In this paper, we tackle this problem by scrutinizing Twitter user timelines in a novel fashion. First of all, we split each user's tweet timeline temporally into a number of clusters, each tending to imply a distinct location. Subsequently, we adapt two machine learning models to our setting and design classifiers that classify each tweet cluster into one of the pre-defined location classes at the city level. The Bayes based model focuses on the information gain of words with location implications in the user-generated contents. The convolutional LSTM model treats user-generated contents and their associated locations as sequences and employs bidirectional LSTM and convolution operation to make location inferences. The two models are evaluated on a large set of real Twitter data. The experimental results suggest that our models are effective at inferring locations for non-geotagged tweets and the models outperform the state-of-the-art and alternative approaches significantly in terms of inference accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8403245/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 June 2019,ieeexplore

However, current operator understanding of consumer satisfaction comes from call centers and base station quality-of-service (QoS) reports with poor geographic accuracy. The dramatic increase in geo-tagged social media posts adds a new potential to understand consumer satisfaction towards target-specific quality-of-experience (QoE) topics. In our paper, we focus on evaluating users' opinion on wireless service-related topics by applying natural language processing (NLP) to geo-tagged Twitter data. Current generalized sentiment detection methods with generalized NLP corpora are not topic specific. Here, we develop a novel wireless service topic-specific sentiment framework, yielding higher targeting accuracy than generalized NLP frameworks. To do so, we first annotate a new sentiment corpus called SignalSentiWord (SSW) and compare its performance with two other popular corpus libraries, AFINN and SentiWordNet. We then apply three established machine learning methods, namely: Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to build our topic-specific sentiment classifier.

Furthermore, a cluster-based latent bias model (LBM) is provided for jointly training the affective pulse as well as user's behavior, location, and social contexts. Our comprehensive trace-driven experiments on Android prototype expose a superior prediction accuracy of 87 percent, which has 25 percent accuracy superior to existing mobile recommender systems.

Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time. Learning-based prediction is attempted by training four classifiers: naïve Bayes, $k$ -nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine. Two independent set of experiments were conducted with oversights of bandwidth and destination prediction. Both the discrete and continuous valued predictors were involved in the training. Performance evaluation of the generated hypothesis in both the cases was conducted using tenfold cross validation. Combined analysis using the assorted combinations of attributes was conducted, and thereafter, the effect of each feature was evaluated through singular attribute portioning. This paper presents observations, which exhibit deviations from the conventional machine learning paradigms. An attempt to increase the prediction accuracy of the classifiers was made through the boosting ensemble methodology. However, miniscule addition in performance was achieved.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068215/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Methods: The risk scoring system is based on the idea of sequential hypothesis testing under an uncertain time horizon. The system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g., age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc).

Given the huge amount of sensitive data available in social network platforms, user privacy protection on social networks has become one of the most urgent research issues. As a traditional information stealing technique, phishing attacks still work in their way to cause a lot of privacy violation incidents. In a Web-based phishing attack, an attacker sets up scam Web pages (pretending to be an important Website such as a social network portal) to lure users to input their private information, such as passwords, social security numbers, credit card numbers, and so on. In fact, the appearance of Web pages is among the most important factors in deceiving users, and thus, the similarity among Web pages is a critical metric for detecting phishing Websites. In this paper, we present a new solution, called Phishing-Alarm, to detect phishing attacks using features that are hard to evade by attackers. In particular, we present an algorithm to quantify the suspiciousness ratings of Web pages based on the similarity of visual appearance between the Web pages. Since cascading style sheet (CSS) is the technique to specify page layout across browser implementations, our approach uses CSS as the basis to accurately quantify the visual similarity of each page element. As page elements do not have the same influence to pages, we base our rating method on weighted page-component similarity. We prototyped our approach in the Google Chrome browser.

Partial shading, nevertheless, is an essential problem which affects the productivity and life of PV plants. PV reconfiguration is known as a powerful technique to resolve this effect. It is achieved by rearranging the PV modules according to their temperature and levels of shade. Therefore, in this paper, we have utilized three simple population-based optimization algorithms that are known as the flow regime algorithm (FRA), the social mimic optimization algorithm (SMO), and the Rao optimization algorithm to dynamically restructure the PV array. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using several metrics such as fill factor, mismatch losses, percentage of power loss, and percentage of power enhancement. Besides, the results obtained are compared with a regular total-cross-tied (TCT) connection and recently published techniques such as the competence square (CS) and genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, to demonstrate the suitability of proposed approaches in real-time implementation, real-time irradiation data of a particular location are considered and fed into the proposed algorithms for effective shade dispersion. After successful shade dispersion, the total energy generated using the three proposed algorithms is calculated and compared with the TCT reconfigured system for one year. The presented energy calculations and revenue generation confirm that the power produced by the proposed FRA technique is 13% higher than that generated by the TCT configuration. Furthermore, the presented PV characteristics show a reduced number of multiple peaks in the system.

Therefore, in this paper, we conducted an experiment to study users' gender identity through a mobile social network. Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender, which can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth, that is, one's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither. In general, a person's psychological gender cannot be observed from the external characteristics of people. And even if some user's attributes such as physical gender and age can be found in social networks, it is difficult to find out the psychological gender of users. Apart from the fact that it will be hidden as the user's privacy, the main reason is that users' behaviors in social networks have no direct relationship with psychological gender. In this paper, we choose a special mobile social network to get around these limitations. Specifically, this paper is based on a real-world large gay social network of more than 10 000 000 users. In this mobile social network, we can indirectly mark the psychological gender of users by their sexual orientation. We collect 1000 users, including their characters, followers, followees and the same data for their followers and followees. Then, we examine an extensive set of features that can be extracted from the data set and train some classifiers to automatically identify the user's psychological gender. In the special mobile social network, a user's psychological gender is related to his characteristics, which include his personal characteristics, dating preference, and so on. This paper mainly analyzes users' personal characteristics, triads, and triadic evolution to infer their psychological gender. The experiments show that all these features are indeed effective in the classification, and even the features considered in previous studies have different implications with gender identity on other social networks. And it turns out that psychological gender as a kind of privacy can be leaked by these unintentional behaviors, and so we give some practical suggestions at the end of this paper to protect users' privacy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8611321/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

The core technique is a novel maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm which combines the multimodel detections in mean-shift tracking. First, a likelihood probability which integrates detections and similarity to local appearance is defined. Then, an expectation-maximization (EM)-like mean-shift algorithm is derived under the ML framework. In each iteration, the E-step estimates the associations to the detections, and the M-step locates the new position according to the ML criterion. To be robust to the complex crowded scenarios for multiperson tracking, an improved sequential strategy to perform the mean-shift tracking is proposed. Under this strategy, human objects are tracked sequentially according to their priority order. To balance the efficiency and robustness for real-time performance, at each stage, the first two objects from the list of the priority order are tested, and the one with the higher score is selected. The proposed method has been successfully implemented on real-world service and social robots.

However, the temporal variation in the topology of social networks and the ongoing dynamic processes challenge our traditional source identification techniques that are considered in static networks. In this paper, we borrow an idea from criminology and propose a novel method to overcome the challenges. First, we reduce the time-varying networks to a series of static networks by introducing a time-integrating window. Second, instead of inspecting every individual in traditional techniques, we adopt a reverse dissemination strategy to specify a set of suspects of the real rumor source. This process addresses the scalability issue of source identification problems, and therefore dramatically promotes the efficiency of rumor source identification. Third, to determine the real source from the suspects, we employ a novel microscopic rumor spreading model to calculate the maximum likelihood (ML) for each suspect. The one who can provide the largest ML estimate is considered as the real source. The evaluations are carried out on real social networks with time-varying topology. The experiment results show that our method can reduce 60 - 90 percent of the source seeking area in various time-varying social networks.

Thus, the sense is befitting to enrich the information of short texts and address the problem of polysemy. By combining topic distribution, social relationships, and users' interests and interactions, we propose a time-aware probabilistic model to profile a user's preference score on items. By predicting the user preference score at a future time interval, the items with top scores can be regarded as the recommended items. Different experiments on real-world datasets are deployed to prove the feasibility and efficiency of sense-based short text topic assignment and item recommendation in multiple languages. The prediction results also demonstrate that the model substantially outperforms the compared methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682139/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

The platform is the result of a codesign effort between computing and social scientists, iteratively developed through a series of pilot studies. The platform is founded upon a knowledge-based approach, in which input streams (channels) are characterized by spatial and terminological parameters, collected media is preprocessed to identify significant terms (signals), and data are tagged (framed) in relation to an ontology. Interpretation of processed media is framed in terms of the 5W framework (who, what, when, where, and why). The platform is designed to be open to the incorporation of new processing modules, building on the knowledge-based elements (channels, signals, and framing ontology) and accessible via a set of user-facing apps. We present the conceptual architecture for the platform, discuss the design and implementation challenges of the underlying stream-processing system, and present a number of apps developed in the context of the pilot studies, highlighting the strengths and importance of the codesign approach and indicating promising areas for future research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8232468/,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,March 2018,ieeexplore

Recent approaches simultaneously explore visual, user and tag information to improve the performance of image retagging by mining the tag-image-user associations. However, such methods will become computationally infeasible with the rapidly increasing number of images, tags and users. It has been proven that the anchor graph can significantly accelerate large-scale graph-based learning by exploring only a small number of anchor points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularized Tensor Completion (SUGAR-TC) method to efficiently refine the tags of social images, which is insensitive to the scale of data. First, we construct an anchor-unit graph across multiple domains (e.g., image and user domains) rather than traditional anchor graph in a single domain. Second, a tensor completion based on Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularization (SUGAR) is implemented to refine the tags of the anchor images. Finally, we efficiently assign tags to non-anchor images by leveraging the relationship between the non-anchor units and the anchor units.

By analyzing network structure, we find that friendship in online social networks can better describe self-report friendship compared to friendship created by frequent physical encounters. Several supervised classifiers with the combination of features extracted from mobile trace data and online social data are used to predict the self-report social relationship under different social strengths. Results show that the proposed model can correctly predict more than 80% friends under strongest social tie strength.

It brings the real challenge to distinguish that what particular information is credible. Especially when user authenticity is hidden, due to the microblog’s anonymity feature. Low credibility content creates an imbalance in society. Therefore many research studies are conducted to assess automatic microblog’s credibility but the majority of them offer different concepts of credibility and the problem seems unresolved. Credibility is multi-disciplinary, hence there is no generalized or accepted credibility concept with all its necessary and detailed constructs/components. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the complete anatomy of information credibility from different disciplines. It is accomplished here through an in-depth and organized study of all the problem dimensions for the identification of comprehensive and necessary credibility constructs. The framework is also proposed based on the identified constructs. It adheres to these constructs and presents their inter-relationships. It is believed that the framework would provide the necessary building blocks for implementing an effective automatic credibility assessment system. The framework is generic to social media and specifically implemented for microblogs. It is completely transformed up to features level, in the context of microblogs. Regarding automatic credibility assessment, it is proposed after detailed analysis that the attempt should be made for hybrid models combining feature-based and graph-based approaches. It is observed that quite a few surveys in the literature focus on some limited aspects of microblogs credibility but no literature survey and fundamental study exists that consolidates the work done. To understand the broader domain of credibility and consolidate the work in this area that can lead us to a suitable framework, we explored the existing literature from different disciplines for the said objectives. We categorized them along various dimensions, developed taxonomy, identified gaps and challenges, proposed a solution, developed a theory-driven framework with its transformation to microblogs, and suggested key areas of research.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9543698/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TSMC.2018.2854000,Social Recommendation With Evolutionary Opinion Dynamics,IEEE,Journals,"When users in online social networks make a decision, they are often affected by their neighbors. Social recommendation models utilize social information to reveal the impact of neighbors on user preferences, and this impact is often described by the linear superposition of neighbor preferences or by global trust propagation. Further exploration needs to be undertaken to determine whether the influence pattern of other users from online interaction behaviors is adequately described. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary opinion dynamics from the field of statistical physics into recommender systems, characterizing the impact of other users. We propose an opinion dynamic model by evolutionary game theory. To describe online user interactions, we define the strategies during an interaction between two users, and present the payoff for each strategy in terms of errors of estimated ratings. Therefore, user behaviors are associated with their preferences and ratings. In addition, we measure user influence according to their topological roles in the social network. We incorporate evolutionary opinion dynamics and user influence into the recommendation framework for the prediction of unknown ratings. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of the-art models in terms of accuracy, and it also performs well for cold-start users. Our method reduces the divergence of user preferences, in accordance with online opinion interactions. Furthermore, our method has approximate computational complexity with matrix factorization, and results in less computation than state-of-the-art models.

Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of BSS usage data to infer the functions each station has and then get the functions of regions where the station located. Based on the historical trip records dataset of users, a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, is adopted to learn the functions of bike stations.

However, such predictions and calculations are neither accurate nor viable in the context of smart TV due to the reasons that it is a lean-back, non-personalized device, and normally enjoyed in groups. Hence, group recommendations have utmost importance, specifically from the perspectives of watching smart TV. The existing group recommendation techniques predict the individual's preferences and then create a virtual group profile for recommendations. However, identifying and satisfying every group member is challenging. Numerous techniques have been proposed, such as face detection and recognition systems, but these systems lead to security and privacy issues. This paper proposes a smart TV-based recommender system that aims to identify the individuals and group members from their “age,” “gender,” and “number” information to overcome the biases that occur due to predictions and estimations of user's preferences. The study proposes a novel formula and age-gender matrix for generating anonymous, consolidated, and secure profiles, including group profiles on a smart TV. This study further proposes a novel method for finding a dominant character in a group by utilizing the user's ratings. Results show that the group decision has a significant impact on supplying social metadata, such as ratings, comments, etc., which in turn improve recommendation results.

In recently proposed approaches, the sampling of nodes of a network is done by simulating random walk. The generated node samples are used to train a neural network to learn the contextual information through an embedding vector. This method has gained popularity as the embedding vector is produced from the primitive node adjacency information and has achieved an outstanding performance. In this article, a naive and scalable approach for generating the node samples based on the principle of goal-oriented greedy searching has been proposed. The generated node samples have low noisy structures, which can represent the relation of edges of the network in a better way, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, better representation of feature embedding of nodes of the network is generated from the samples. The learned feature vectors are used for solving the link prediction problem using a pairwise kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which is computationally and spatially expensive in nature. Therefore, as an alternative, we have chosen to deploy a random forest (RF) classifier with a new algebraic operation to obtain the symmetric pairwise feature representation of a node pair.

Widespread acceptability of mobile service robots in daily life is hindered by robot's inability to navigate in crowded and dynamic human environments in a socially acceptable way that would guarantee human safety and comfort. In this paper, we propose an effective proactive social motion model (PSMM) that enables a mobile service robot to navigate safely and socially in crowded and dynamic environments. The proposed method considers not only human states (position, orientation, motion, field of view, and hand poses) relative to the robot but also social interactive information about human-object and human group interactions. This allows development of the PSMM that consists of elements of an extended social force model and a hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacle technique. The PSMM is then combined with a path planning technique to generate a motion planning system that drives a mobile robot in a socially acceptable manner and produces respectful and polite behaviors akin to human movements. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed proactive social motion model (PSMM) through both simulation and real-world experiments under the newly proposed human comfortable safety indices. To do that, we first implemented the entire navigation system using the open-source robot operating system. We then installed it in a simulated robot model and conducted experiments in a simulated shopping mall-like environment to verify its effectiveness. We also installed the proposed algorithm on our mobile robot platform and conducted experiments in our office-like laboratory environment. Our results show that the developed socially aware navigation framework allows a mobile robot to navigate safely, socially, and proactively while guaranteeing human safety and comfort in crowded and dynamic environments. In this paper, we examined the proposed PSMM with a set of predefined parameters selected based on our empirical experiences about the robot mechanism and selected social environment. However, in fact a mobile robot might need to adapt to various contextual and cultural situations in different social environments. Thus, it should be equipped with an online adaptive interactive learning mechanism allowing the robot to learn to auto-adjust their parameters according to such embedded environments. Using machine learning techniques, e.g., inverse reinforcement learning [1] to optimize the parameter set for the PSMM could be a promising research direction to improve adaptability of mobile service robots in different social environments. In the future, we will evaluate the proposed framework based on a wider variety of scenarios, particularly those with different social interaction situations and dynamic environments. Furthermore, various kinds of social cues and signals introduced in [2] and [3] will be applied to extend the proposed framework in more complicated social situations and contexts.

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

In this paper, a new type of network community in online social networks (OSNs) is identified using the association between network nodes. This new network community is called “virtual community.” Virtual communities are based on either the real/ physical relationships of users that are connected to their constituency, social, and professional activities or their virtual interactions associated with their cognitive levels, choice selection, and ideology. Users belonging to the same virtual community exhibit similar behavior in linking to nodes of common interest. These nodes, which reflect the common interest of a community, are called “prime nodes.” Prime nodes are linked to the prediction problem in OSN completion and are generally recommended for OSN growth. Recent studies on ranking algorithms have shown that the incompleteness of OSNs contributes to the low accuracy of ranking algorithms in identifying top spreaders. Thus, in this paper, we propose an OSN completion method based on link prediction through association between prime nodes.

Easy and quick information proliferation is one of the reasons for its popularity. An extensive number of users with different age groups, gender, and societal beliefs are engaged in social media websites. Despite these favorable aspects, a significant disadvantage comes in the form of fake news, as people usually read and share information without caring about its genuineness. Therefore, it is imperative to research methods for the authentication of news. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-phase benchmark model named WELFake based on word embedding (WE) over linguistic features for fake news detection using machine learning classification. The first phase preprocesses the data set and validates the veracity of news content by using linguistic features. The second phase merges the linguistic feature sets with WE and applies voting classification.

To bridge this gap, we implemented an in-situ study where 26 users, age 11, played 2 maths MBTGs in a single 20-30 minute session.

10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00087,Mining the Critical Conditions for New Hypotheses of Materials from Historical Reaction Data,IEEE,Conferences,"The new findings in material science often require a high research cost for the following two aspects. First is that the chemical reaction craft needs continuous optimization and may consume lots of valuable reactants and apparatus during daily experiments. Second, the success of a designed experiment relies heavily on researchers' experience. With the starting of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, researchers are beginning to record historical reaction data, and seek new solutions via computer techniques, such as data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we study the reaction data of inorganic-organic hybrid materials from the Dark Reaction Project from Haverford College with simple machine learning algorithms (i.e., Bayes Net, SVM and C4.5), ensemble learning models (i.e., Random Forest, Stacking, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and XGBoost), and deep neural network models. Besides accuracy of the prediction models, we also analyze the reaction conditions that have important reflecting in chemistry with different ranking algorithms. With a series of evaluation, we find that the welldesigned stacking-based ensemble learning model can reach the highest prediction accuracy of 61% (8% higher than GBDT and 5% higher than XGBoost) on the top50 subsets based on 'symmetrical uncertainty ranking' on the standalone data set which was not used in the Dark Reaction Project before.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8560065/,"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)",8-12 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3079447,ECT-LSTM-RNN: An Electrical Capacitance Tomography Model-Based Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks for Conductive Materials,IEEE,Journals,"Image reconstruction for industrial applications based on Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) has been broadly applied. The goal of image reconstruction based ECT is to locate the distribution of permittivity for the dielectric substances along the cross-section based on the collected capacitance data. In the ECT-based image reconstruction process: (1) the relationship between capacitance measurements and permittivity distribution is nonlinear, (2) the capacitance measurements collected during image reconstruction are inadequate due to the limited number of electrodes, and (3) the reconstruction process is subject to noise leading to an ill-posed problem. Thence, constructing an accurate algorithm for real images is critical to overcoming such restrictions. This paper presents novel image reconstruction methods using Deep Learning for solving the forward and inverse problems of the ECT system for generating high-quality images of conductive materials in the Lost Foam Casting (LFC) process. Here, Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) models were implemented to predict the distribution of metal filling for the LFC process-based ECT. The recurrent connection and the gating mechanism of the LSTM is capable of extracting the contextual information that is repeatedly passing through the neural network while filtering out the noise caused by adverse factors. Experimental results showed that the presented ECT-LSTM-RNN model is highly reliable for industrial applications and can be utilized for other manufacturing processes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9429218/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIFS.2015.2464772,Open Set Fingerprint Spoof Detection Across Novel Fabrication Materials,IEEE,Journals,"A fingerprint spoof detector is a pattern classifier that is used to distinguish a live finger from a fake (spoof) one in the context of an automated fingerprint recognition system. Most spoof detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Consequently, the performance of any such spoof detector significantly degrades when encountering spoofs fabricated using novel materials not found in the training set. In real-world applications, the problem of fingerprint spoof detection must be treated as an open set recognition problem where incomplete knowledge of the fabrication materials used to generate spoofs is present at training time, and novel materials may be encountered during system deployment. To mitigate the security risk posed by novel spoofs, this paper introduces: 1) the use of the Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM), which is relatively robust for open set recognition, as a novel-material detector and a spoof detector and 2) a scheme for the automatic adaptation of the W-SVM-based spoof detector to new spoof materials that leverages interoperability across classifiers. Experiments conducted on new partitions of the LivDet 2011 database designed for open set evaluation suggest: 1) a 97% increase in the error rate of the existing spoof detectors when tested using new spoof materials and 2) up to 44% improvement in spoof detection performance across spoof materials when the proposed adaptive approach is used.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180344/,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,Nov. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICITAET47105.2019.9170214,A Basic Permanent Magnets Array Interaction Project for Teaching Artificial Intelligence as a Complementary Model,IEEE,Conferences,"There are new algorithms such as artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies that have achieved accurate representation of experimental systems. On the other hand, undergraduate freshmen students must understand AI methodologies since the industry has developed several products based on those and some academic problems also can be solved using AI. If those students do not learn how to model real systems using AI, they will be losing the opportunity of applying this powerful tool for solving several real problems in their professional life. Since the AI model can be a representation for forecasting the performance of the real model, this model can help the design process and provide information during its operation. This paper proposes an engineering project to teach artificial intelligence algorithms using real systems that are non-linear. Since permanent magnets are used in several applications, they can be attractive for modeling those when they are interacting between them; hence, this paper shows the interaction among them when they are deployed as an electrical power source. Moreover, this source could be classified as a renewable energy source. The basic generation of electrical energy is based on changing the magnetic field. Although the operation principle is basic, the electrical source has a non-liner description that is extremely complex so AI could be applied to create a model that represents those non-linear relationships in a precise manner. The main goal of this work is to describe an undergraduate project that can be used for teaching how to model a real system using AI algorithms. The main characteristics and properties of the permanent magnets are studied for the comprehension of how magnets can be implemented. It is also examined the viability for the construction of an electric motor using only permanent magnets, based on the analysis of different designs and materials and finally an AI model is created.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9170214/,2019 International Conference on Innovative Trends and Advances in Engineering and Technology (ICITAET),27-28 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Among these approaches, the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) carries the potential of dealing with nonlinear and non-Gaussian industry problems, which has drawn increasing popularity and attentions in recent years. However, the fluctuation of raw materials, change of process environment, aging of instruments and other factors will have an effect on system performances over time. Hence, the lack of adaptive mechanism will make the GMR difficult to suit for time-varying processes and may cause large prediction errors. In order to model time-varying industrial processes and improve the adaptability of the conventional GMR, an adaptive soft sensor based on incremental Gaussian mixture regression (IGMR) is proposed in this paper. The incremental idea is integrated and an adaptive mechanism is added, which endow the proposed IGMR with the capability of adapting to new data in online environment.

10.1109/CCBD.2016.038,Decision Support System for Real-Time Trading Based on On-Line Learning and Parallel Computing Techniques,IEEE,Conferences,"A novel intraday algorithmic trading strategy is developed based on various machine learning techniques and paralleled computing architectures in this paper. The proposed binary classification framework can predict the price trends of Taiwan stock index futures after thirty minutes. Traditional learning-based approaches collect all samples during the training period as the learning materials. The major contribution of this paper is to collect a subset of similar historical financial data to train the real-time trading model. This goal can be achieved by an on-line learning technique which is required to calculate an accurate model with training time limitation. In addition, the proposed joint-AdaBoost algorithm is to improve the system performance based on the concept of paired feature learning and planar weak classifier design. The core execution components in this algorithm can be further accelerated with the aid of Open Computing Language (OpenCL) parallel computing platform. The experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of final classifier from 53.8% to 61.68%. Compared to the pure CPU implementation, the OpenCL version which uses CPU and GPGPU simultaneously can reduce the calculation time around 83.02 times. The efficiency improvement can decrease the delay of investment opportunity which is a critical issue in real-time financial decision support system application. To sum up, this paper proposed a novel learning framework based on joint-AdaBoost algorithm with similar learning samples and OpenCL parallel computation. The extended financial decision support system is also proven to work effectively and efficiently in our simulation experiments to trade the Taiwan stock index futures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7979896/,2016 7th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD),16-18 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore
10.1109/ITherm51669.2021.9503247,Deep Learning to Enhance Transient Thermal Performance and Real-Time Control of an Energy Storage (TES) Platform,IEEE,Conferences,"Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are used for thermal energy storage (TES) due to their high latent heat capacity. While inorganic PCMs have the ability to store large amounts of thermal energy (as they possess higher values of latent heat capacity) they need significant supercooling to initiate solidification - which compromises their operational reliability (compared to organic PCMs). `Cold Finger Technique'/ CFT (wherein a portion of the PCM is maintained in the solid-state as the un-melted PCM serves to initiate nucleation for subsequent solidification of the rest of the PCM) enables higher operational reliability at the expense of a marginal loss of storage capacity (from the portion of the PCM that remains un-melted). In order to apply CFT, one possible approach is to target a desired melt fraction in the early stages of operation for avoiding catastrophic failure (i.e., avoiding 100% melting). The objective is to reach as close to 100% melting as possible - without completely melting the whole mass of PCM - using a reliable and predictable method. Hence, at any instant, a reliable way is desired to predict the time remaining to reach a particular melt fraction of the PCM (during the melting cycle).In this study we determine the efficacy of employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques, especially Deep Learning, for predicting the time remaining to reach a target melt fraction at any instant during the melting cycle. The time history of the PCM melt fraction and temperature transients at multiple locations within the TES platform can thus be correlated by employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to achieve this goal. The aim of this study is to develop and deploy ANN based prediction tools that can enable real-time predictions (e.g., when the melt cycle should be stopped and freezing cycle should be initiated) apriori based on instantaneous values of temperature measured during operation of a TES platform. The data for training and evaluating the efficacy of the ANN model predictions is obtained from PCM melting experiments performed in this study using PureTemp29. Initially a solid mass of PCM is melted (using a nichrome wire heater mounted at the bottom) in a graduated cylinder with three thermocouples recording the temperatures at distinct locations along the height of the cylinder. An automated digital data acquisition (DAQ) system is used to record the transient temperature profiles from these thermocouples. The height of the liquid meniscus (melted PCM) is recorded using a digital image acquisition apparatus (and also monitored periodically from the measuring cylinder containing the PCM) until the PCM is completely melted. The results show that the predictions of the ANN model are most accurate in the later stages of the melting cycle. The error decreases as the melt fraction approaches the target melt. For a target melt of 90%, the error in predictions in the last 1800 seconds of the melting cycle is in the range 150-350 seconds.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9503247/,2021 20th IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (iTherm),1-4 June 2021,ieeexplore

However, due to the inherent compliance of the materials used to build soft robots, it is extremely complicated to control soft robots accurately. In this paper, we introduce a data-based control framework for solving the soft robot underwater locomotion problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We first built a soft robot that can swim based on the dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA). We then modeled it in a simulation for the purpose of training the neural network and tested the performance of the control framework through real experiments on the robot. The framework includes the following: a simulation method for the soft robot that can be used to collect data for training the neural network, the neural network controller of the swimming robot trained in the simulation environment, and the computer vision method to collect the observation space from the real robot using a camera. We confirmed the effectiveness of the learning method for the soft swimming robot in the simulation environment by allowing the robot to learn how to move from a random initial state to a specific direction. After obtaining the trained neural network through the simulation, we deployed it on the real robot and tested the performance of the control framework. The soft robot successfully achieved the goal of moving in a straight line in disturbed water.

However, classifying what VOC exists in the environment still remains as a complex task. Knowing what VOCs are in the air can help us remove the main cause that vents VOC materials in order to maintain clean air quality.

VOCkit combines miniature chemically-designed fluorometric sensors for recognizing VOCs with an embedded imaging system for classification. Exposing the fluorometric sensors with various VOCs, result in photophysical property change of each fluorescent compound, which composes the sensors, and the synergistic combination of the changes create unique individual fluorescent color patterns respectively to the VOC material. The fluorescent color change pattern is captured using a camera and the images are processed with machine learning algorithms on the embedded platform for VOC classification.

However, capturing the specialized needs of customers accurately is a difficult task because their needs depend on time, context, situation, and meaning. Recently, physical computational environments have been developing rapidly, thereby allowing easy implementation to sense a customer's action and deal with it sequentially. In this paper, we propose a personalized method to predict individual interests and demands appropriately. In particular, the system learns the customers' situation, meaning, and action from their action history, and reflects a feedback of the result to predict the next action. To realize this method, we utilize the following two methodologies: the mathematical model of meaning (MMM), which is a semantic associative search technology; and the local variational inference (LVI), which is an approximation of the Bayesian inference.

On the contrary, the requirement of a perfect state for used materials is unavoidable in order to assure both transport reliability and passenger safety. Therefore, a real-time approach able to recognize and classify the defect starting from the finite element simulated ultrasonic echoes could be very useful in industrial applications. The ill-posedness of the so defined process induces a regularization method. In this paper, a finite element and a heuristic approach are proposed.

In order to implement predictive control for the HVAC system and natural ventilation, the model needs to have the capability to predict building thermal responses under various environmental and operational conditions. This task can be accomplished by using a deep neural network, which would capture the effects of complicated physical processes, such as natural ventilation. However, a deep neural network comes with a high demand for training data. In real-world applications, the target building may not have the necessary amount of operational data available. This study demonstrates how transfer learning could solve this dilemma. By freezing partial weights of a deep neural network model that is pretrained on multi-year data from a base case building, it can be quickly deployed to different buildings in other climates. With much fewer trainable parameters, the model can then be well-trained on only 15 days of data from the new target building. The base case and target case can have entirely different floor areas, building materials, and window sizes. This transfer learning model performs significantly better than a comparable model that is only trained on source data or target data, achieving high predicting accuracy on both indoor air temperature and relative humidity in the time horizon from 10 minutes to two hours. This methodology can be applied to the design of the control system in a new building.

Heretic hears, recognizes, and organizes unseen musical material from a human improviser into a fluid, coherent, and expressive musical language. Systems similar to Heretic often prioritize agnostic approaches to machine listening by avoiding prior musical knowledge in the system's training stage.

Beyond the real-time status update, utilizing vast IoT data and creating machine learning and optimization models provide us with intelligent business recommendations. Those are used by the site engineers and managers to make real-time decisions in a situation with multiple conflicting operational and business goals. Those goals include maximizing financial gain, minimizing costs, limiting the usage of certain raw materials or additives, decreasing environmental impact, and more. When formalizing these decision-making tasks, often there is no prior knowledge of compromise between the conflicting goals. That poses a challenge to generate a proper objective function. In this paper, we create a Multi-Step optimization process to address this uncertainty of selecting proper objectives and their preferences. Instead of using an explicit trade-off to create a single weighted objective function (as a traditional approach) and rely on a single attempt to find the optimal solution, we decompose this problem into multiple steps. In each step, we optimize only one objective from one KPI with an exact semantic meaning. We demonstrate the usability of the approach using a practical application from an oil sands processing facility, provide modeling results focusing on the response to business priorities, performance, and interpretability.

The model parameters are optimized to adapt to the experimental data, mainly for the neural network from the aspects of model structure, data preprocessing, activation function selection, etc. So as to the simulation data under the experiment assumption, no many iterations are needed for achieving less than 0.0001 dB error. If communication scenarios and interference sources are replaced, the strong learning ability based on neural networks and adjustment of model parameters based on interference data distribution can provide rapid migration learning to fit a good effect.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8598181/,2018 Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS-Toyama),1-4 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

Nearly 3275 sq.km of area spread over the Ratnapura District, seems to be highly prone to landslides and mass wastage of 2178 sq.km. Landslides occur in many regions of Ratnapura district and nearly 90 deaths have been reported according to National Research Building Organization (NBRO) in 2017. Most landslides or potential failures could be predicted fairly accurately if proper investigations were performed in time. The primary objective of this study is landslide-hazard mapping and risk evaluation to determine the real extent, timing, and severity of landslide processes in Ratnapura district. Such knowledge will provide the most significant benefit to government officials, consulting engineering firms, and the general public in avoiding the landslide hazard or in mitigating the losses. Hybrid Machine Learning techniques can be used to develop prediction models using existing data. Ensemble approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes model were combined and implemented for the final prediction. This study possesses a strong capability to predict landslides by causative factors, slope, land use, elevation, geology, soil materials and triggering factor; rainfall was extracted and applied to the machine learning algorithms.

The problem appears in many engineering applications including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing systems where the governing equation for tension is nonlinear. Currently known methods for the nonlinear output regulation problem either require the solution of a constrained partial differential equation or the preview information of the signal to be tracked. In this paper, we consider the problem of regulating web tension while rejecting periodic disturbances and use a novel approach to synthesize feedforward control as the solution of a system of differential-algebraic equations, which is considerably less complex and suitable for practical implementation. We assume that the disturbance signal is the output of a known exogenous system with unknown initial conditions. A parameter identification scheme to estimate the unknown initial conditions is developed. The proposed technique is successfully applied to web tension regulation in a large R2R machine which contains real-time hardware and software that is used in industrial practice.

As in many other wireless power transfer systems, one of the main challenges to face is the proper detection of the magnetic coupling with the induction heating load in order to provide improved thermal performance and safe power electronic converter operation. This is specially challenging due to the high variability in the materials used in cookware as well as the random pot placement in flexible induction heating appliances.

The goal of image reconstruction based ECT is to locate the distribution of permittivity for the dielectric substances along the cross-section based on the collected capacitance data. In the ECT-based image reconstruction process: (1) the relationship between capacitance measurements and permittivity distribution is nonlinear, (2) the capacitance measurements collected during image reconstruction are inadequate due to the limited number of electrodes, and (3) the reconstruction process is subject to noise leading to an ill-posed problem. Thence, constructing an accurate algorithm for real images is critical to overcoming such restrictions. This paper presents novel image reconstruction methods using Deep Learning for solving the forward and inverse problems of the ECT system for generating high-quality images of conductive materials in the Lost Foam Casting (LFC) process.

10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1139,Extreme Compression and Modeling of Bidirectional Texture Function,IEEE,Journals,"The recent advanced representation for realistic real-world materials in virtual reality applications is the bidirectional texture function (BTF), which describes rough texture appearance for varying illumination and viewing conditions. Such a function can be represented by thousands of measurements (images) per material sample. The resulting BTF size excludes its direct rendering in graphical applications and some compression of these huge BTF data spaces is obviously inevitable. In this paper, we present a novel, fast probabilistic model-based algorithm for realistic BTF modeling allowing an extreme compression with the possibility of a fast hardware implementation. Its ultimate aim is to create a visual impression of the same material without a pixelwise correspondence to the original measurements. The analytical step of the algorithm starts with a BTF space segmentation and a range map estimation by photometric stereo of the BTF surface, followed by the spectral and spatial factorization of selected subspace color texture images. Single mono-spectral band-limited factors are independently modeled by their dedicated spatial probabilistic model. During rendering, the subspace images of arbitrary size are synthesized and both color (possibly multispectral) and range information is combined in a bump-mapping filter according to the view and illumination directions. The presented model offers a huge BTF compression ratio unattainable by any alternative sampling-based BTF synthesis method. Simultaneously, this model can be used to reconstruct missing parts of the BTF measurement space.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4293214/,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,Oct. 2007,ieeexplore

These new materials will require particular care when the machine operates, considering that they are much more vulnerable than the present combination of graphite and stainless steel. Early detection of hot spots, which are regions of the first wall where the temperature approaches dangerous levels, is considered one essential element in the safety strategy. In this paper, cellular nonlinear networks (CNNs) are applied to the task of detecting hot spots in the infrared images of JET wide-angle camera. The ability of the CNNs to process the pixels of the images in parallel makes this technology a very good candidate for this task. Various algorithms are presented, which can locate the hot regions in any part of the image with a temporal resolution on the order of 60 ms, which is considered adequate for safety purposes at JET. In addition to the frame-by-frame static identification of the hot spots, their evolution in time is also followed to determine if they approach dangerous parts of the vacuum vessel. The potential of the CNNs would therefore allow for the implementation of alternative protection strategies, such as following the increase and displacement of the hot spots inside the entire vacuum vessel and identifying particles dropping into the plasma.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4735616/,IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,Jan. 2009,ieeexplore
10.1109/TVCG.2019.2963015,Interactive Simulation of Scattering Effects in Participating Media Using a Neural Network Model,IEEE,Journals,"Rendering participating media is important to the creation of photorealistic images. Participating media has a translucent aspect that comes from light being scattered inside the material. For materials with a small mean-free-path (mfp), multiple scattering effects dominate. Simulating these effects is computationally intensive, as it requires tracking a large number of scattering events inside the material. Existing approaches precompute multiple scattering events inside the material and store the results in a table. During rendering time, this table is used to compute the scattering effects. While these methods are faster than explicit scattering computation, they incur higher storage costs. In this paper, we present a new representation for double and multiple scattering effects that uses a neural network model. The scattering response from all homogeneous participating media is encoded into a neural network in a preprocessing step. At run time, the neural network is then used to predict the double and multiple scattering effects. We demonstrate the effects combined with Virtual Ray Lights (VRL), although our approach can be integrated with other rendering algorithms. Our algorithm is implemented on GPU. Double and multiple scattering effects for the entire participating media space are encoded using only 23.6 KB of memory.

To alleviate this issue, we propose to exploit the symmetries present in robotic tasks. Intuitively, symmetries from observed trajectories define transformations that leave the space of feasible RL trajectories invariant and can be used to generate new feasible trajectories, which could be used for training. Based on this data augmentation idea, we formulate a general framework, called Invariant Transform Experience Replay that we present with two techniques: (i) Kaleidoscope Experience Replay exploits reflectional symmetries and (ii) Goal-augmented Experience Replay which takes advantage of lax goal definitions. In the Fetch tasks from OpenAI Gym, our experimental results show significant increases in learning rates and success rates. Particularly, we attain a 13, 3, and 5 times speedup in the pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place tasks respectively in the multi-goal setting. Performance gains are also observed in similar tasks with obstacles and we successfully deployed a trained policy on a real Baxter robot.

Indeed, standard methods, like X-rays, metal detectors and near-infrared imaging, cannot detect low-density materials. Microwave sensing is an alternative method that, combined with machine learning classifiers, can tackle these deficiencies. In this paper we present a design methodology applied to a case study in the food sector. Specifically, we offer a complete flow from microwave dataset acquisition to deployment of the classifiers on real-time hardware and we show the effectiveness of this method in terms of detection accuracy. In the case study, we apply the machine-learning based microwave sensing approach to the case of food jars flowing at high speed on a conveyor belt. First, we collected a dataset from hazelnut-cocoa spread jars which were uncontaminated or contaminated with various intrusions, including low-density plastics. Then, we performed a design space exploration to choose the best MLPs as binary classifiers, which resulted to be exceptionally accurate. Finally, we selected the two most light-weight models for implementation on both an ARM-based CPU and an FPGA SoC, to cover a wide range of possible latency requirements, from loose to strict, to detect contaminants in real-time.

Most spoof detectors are learning-based and rely on a set of training images. Consequently, the performance of any such spoof detector significantly degrades when encountering spoofs fabricated using novel materials not found in the training set. In real-world applications, the problem of fingerprint spoof detection must be treated as an open set recognition problem where incomplete knowledge of the fabrication materials used to generate spoofs is present at training time, and novel materials may be encountered during system deployment. To mitigate the security risk posed by novel spoofs, this paper introduces: 1) the use of the Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM), which is relatively robust for open set recognition, as a novel-material detector and a spoof detector and 2) a scheme for the automatic adaptation of the W-SVM-based spoof detector to new spoof materials that leverages interoperability across classifiers. Experiments conducted on new partitions of the LivDet 2011 database designed for open set evaluation suggest: 1) a 97% increase in the error rate of the existing spoof detectors when tested using new spoof materials and 2) up to 44% improvement in spoof detection performance across spoof materials when the proposed adaptive approach is used.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180344/,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,Nov. 2015,ieeexplore

The problem appears in many engineering applications including Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing systems. Currently known methods for this problem either require the solution of a constrained partial differential equation or the preview information of the signal to be tracked. The novelty of this paper lies in synthesizing feedforward control as the solution of a system of differential-algebraic equations, which is considerably less complex and suitable for practical implementation. In this paper, we consider the problem of regulating the output while rejecting the disturbances and apply it to R2R manufacturing systems. The problem of tracking reference signals can also be handled with the suggested technique. We assume that the disturbance signal is the output of a known exogenous system with unknown initial conditions. A parameter identification scheme to estimate the unknown initial conditions is developed. The proposed technique is successfully applied to control of web tension in a large R2R machine which mimics most of the features of industrial R2R machines and contains real-time hardware and software that is used in industrial practice.

For the second approach, a SMOS soil moisture product has been produced based on a Neural Network (NN) trained on ECMWF soil moisture. So, the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product captures the SMOS signal variability in time and space, while by design its climatology is consistent with that of the ECMWF soil moisture, which makes it suitable for data assimilation purpose. This approach, initially tested for 2012 in a global scale stand alone approach, shows that SMOS NN data assimilation slightly improves the two-metre air temperature forecast in the short range at regional scale. For NWP applications this approach has been further developed with a near real time production of the SMOS-ECMWF NN soil moisture product, with the implementation of the SMOS NN data assimilation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), and with high resolution (9km) global scale testing compatible with the current ECMWF NWP system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8519369/,IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium,22-27 July 2018,ieeexplore
