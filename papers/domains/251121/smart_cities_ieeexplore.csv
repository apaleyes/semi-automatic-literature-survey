The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space.

Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups. In addition, the paper discusses the deployment challenges of the implemented system, which include the lack and need thereof of a standardized protocol for IoMT data collection and analysis for cross interoperability across different healthcare providers and vendors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8907997/,2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart Cities: Improving Quality of Life Using ICT & IoT and AI (HONET-ICT),6-9 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated. The use cases are then evaluated based on the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The scope for future directions and conclusions are sketched towards the end, with an optimism that the current work will be an eye-opener and adaptable to other developing countries.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9183832/,"2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)",6-7 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547185/,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB),4-6 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

In this paper, we study two research problems to maximize the overall Quality-of-Service (QoS) level of all IoT analytics that run on both data center servers and gateways. The first problem is to select additional IoT analytics to deploy on a gateway to save upload bandwidth due to transmitting raw sensor data. The second problem is to allocate the residue upload bandwidth among all IoT analytics to maximize the overall QoS level. We propose several algorithms to solve these two research problems.

Many of these applications and services manage real-time data analytics with high volumes of data, thus requiring an efficient computing infrastructure. Edge computing helps to enable this scenario improving service latency and reducing network saturation. This computing paradigm consists on the deployment of numerous smaller data centers located near the data sources. The energy efficiency is a key challenge to implement this scenario, and the management of federated edge data centers would benefit from the use of microgrid energy sources parameterized by user's demands.

The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree. City power supply network and gas pipeline management scenarios are used to drive our prototype as case studies.

This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated.

To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

This type of learning process will provide education for all. The Indian educational satellite networks are compared with those of other nations to understand the methodologies to improve literacy. The value addition provided by educational technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Augmented Reality, Virtual Classroom, etc. in association with satellite networks, is also investigated. In the urban areas and Smart Cities, high tech education is best implemented by using high bandwidth satellite networks in conjunction with high speed terrestrial optical fiber links and modern EdTech. This paper examines the synergistic utilization of educational technologies with ubiquitous connectivity of satellites to provide education to tribal as well as remote hilly regions like the recently created Union Territory of Ladakh.

One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of what-if decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated.

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy.

This not only causes local traffic chaos but also interferes with the driving efficiency of the entire roads. This phenomenon is a common problem faced by modern metropolitan areas. To reduce the time spent in finding parking spaces, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to effectively improve overall driving efficiency, the systemization of urban roadside or off-street parking has become a key issue that needs attention and demonstration in so-called “smart” cities. In this paper, we have designed and applied an mm-Wave Radar to detect the presence or absence of available parking spaces, and the parking space data can be quickly uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, the status of the parking space can be updated in real-time. Based on this parking space status data, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to conduct deep learning. The input data of this model includes parking space location, parking space status, and parking time factors. Using mm-Wave radar experiment with the trained LSTM output provides parking space status prediction which enables drivers to obtain parking space status before they arrive at the destination.

Despite several research efforts, there is still a lack of consensus about the most effective way to predict traffic network-wide. Also, the majority of existing studies rely on either small data sets or limited portions of the transportation network. This paper presents the results of a forecasting study related to on-board units data of heavy-goods vehicles in the Brussels-Capital Region. The analysis, enabled by deployment of a big data infrastructure, concerns the short horizon (one hour ahead) forecasting of trucks flow (vehicles/hour) and mean speed (km/hour) over Brussels-Capital Region's network. Both parametric and non-parametric (notably machine learning) models are designed and assessed along with different strategies (simple and linear forecasts combination, individual model selection).

These advanced technologies bring about numerous benefits and has begun to play a major role in daily lives, particularly data mining applied in precision agriculture to discover knowledge. Also in agro-industrial production chain, the combination of wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries is outstanding. Mobile IoT such as narrow-band-IoT (NB-IoT) and the long-term evolution (LTE) for machines (LTE-M) are significant innovations of this accelerating development of IoT technologies. In the era of ubiquitous communication where everything is connected to the internet, NB-IoT systems are expected to offer better quality-of-services (QoS) to end users than the traditional IoT paradigm. However, offering better QoS satisfaction to end users will become a great challenge due to the bottleneck caused by the dual problem of increasing IoT use cases and the shortage of wireless spectrum resources. Whilst discussing the recent innovative solutions of NB-IoT resource allocation, significant challenges and open issues related to the real-time implementation of NBIoT are identified and discussed. Therefore, this paper gives a general overview of the resource allocation solutions in this NB-IoT innovation and further suggests and motivates for the intelligentization of future resource allocation solutions (i.e., the use of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9179427/,"2020 International Conference on Electrical, Communication, and Computer Engineering (ICECCE)",12-13 June 2020,ieeexplore

In particular, real-time object recognition has become an important technology in smart cities. To achieve this, low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are the key technologies. In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, it has not been considered to increase the batch size of arrival data at edge servers ensuring low-latency transmission. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via TWDM-PONe We also propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrival at the edge.

The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

Such a composite view allows for future improvements in quality of critical details using techniques as super resolution, while at the same time removing unnecessary private information.

Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted.

Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9127904/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9576739/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal. The proposed CNN-based system has been tested on both desktop computers and typical WASN devices (such as Raspberry Pi), achieving very fast calculation times that allow real-time operation and a continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096320/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2020",ieeexplore

Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion.

The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state. It is accurate and efficient and can easily be applied to other traffic datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8917560/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 June 2021,ieeexplore

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427992/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068215/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld.

Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area.

In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used to give an accurate estimate of the arrival time (ETA) to the commuter by means of an application. ETA to the next stop is communicated to the commuter using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, by the hardware mounted on the bus.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS).

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules.

In this paper, we consider the problem of how to allocate the calculation ability of the Fog node to handle the surveillance data to obtain low delay meanwhile maintain the video quality. To solve this challenge, we attempt to reduce the tremendous video data using deep learning models in the computational Fog node and optimize the transmission function for high efficiency. To reduce data, we extract video feature and keep salient zones with high resolution meanwhile leave the unavoidable distortion in less important areas. To obtain the least transmission delay under the dynamic bandwidth in Fog computing, we model the transmission delay function and solve it by Lagrangian dual decomposition.

10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223311,Blockchain framework for real-time streaming data generated in image sensor networks for smart monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"The smart city concept is attracting increasing attention from society. Smart monitoring, which enables the detection and prevention of road traffic accidents, is one promising application of the smart city concept. The deployment of three-dimensional (3D) image sensor networks formed by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices interconnected via a network is a key enabler for smart monitoring. Data collected by image sensor networks for smart monitoring are sensitive because the usage of the data is often related to public safety or law enforcement. Managing sensor data using the blockchain technology is one way to address these sensitivity concerns, as a blockchain network helps prevent data from being tampered with even by the administrators of the system. However, prior works have not considered how to handle streaming data such as image sensor data generated by LIDAR devices in real-time, which means there is a risk of overflow in the network if the data are handled frame by frame. In response to this issue, we propose a blockchain framework for real-time monitoring in a smart city using image sensor networks. Our key concept with this framework is to aggregate hash values converted from multiple frames of image sensor data into one hash value.

Due to this problem, many researchers proposed an automatic parking lot occupancy detection system using a camera with a deep learning method to provide useful information in the smart city system. Since object detection for the parking lot is performed in real-time by utilizing CPU and GPUs while parking detection is working 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, therefore power saving is important to reduce the electricity cost. However, the energy-aware is not considered in most related works. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving algorithm for parking lot availability detection using YOLO running on the TX2 machine. We experiment using small parking lot prototype and remote control cars.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot.

However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure.

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification.

10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917004,A neuro-dynamic programming approach for perimeter control of two urban regions with macroscopic fundamental diagrams,IEEE,Conferences,"Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model is widely used to describe urban traffic dynamic system. Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced. Firstly, the value function is approximated by a neural network. Then the parameters are optimized by the policy iteration method, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative error toward set-point. Furthermore, the optimal control law constrained by a saturated operator is implemented based on real-time observations recursively. The neuro-dynamic controller is tested for the two-regional MFD system. The results confirm that the neuro-dynamic controller can regulate the traffic states converge to the desired uncongested equilibrium.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8917004/,2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),27-30 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6987009/,2014 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST),13-16 Oct. 2014,ieeexplore

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city. In addition the networks have been implemented on an embedded GPU platform to investigate the real-time capability of the presented approach. The networks were configured and trained to predict five seconds into the future with a sample time of 0.2 s. The results of each network are presented and compared against each other. The results show that the implemented networks are capable of predicting a trajectory in short to mid-term (1 - 3 s) with good accuracy while having difficulties predicting turn maneuvers in long-term range (3 - 5 s) due to the lack of road layout information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564999/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854752,Compressed prediction of large-scale urban traffic,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic prediction lies at the core of many intelligent transport systems (ITS). Commonly deployed prediction methods such as support vector regression and neural networks achieve good performance by explicitly predicting the traffic variables (e.g., traffic speed or volume) at each road segment in the network. For large traffic networks, predicting traffic variable at each road segment may be unwieldy, especially in the setting of real-time prediction. To tackle this problem, we propose an alternative approach in this paper. We first generate low-dimensional representation of the network, leveraging on the column-based (CX) decomposition of matrices. The low-dimensional model represents the large network in terms of a small subset of road segments. The future state of the low-dimensional network is predicted by standard procedures, i.e., support vector regression. The future state of the entire network is then inferred by extrapolating the predictions of the subnetwork, using the CX decomposition.

Nevertheless, manually labeling semantic segmentation dataset with pixel-level annotation is extremely labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-level feature alignment framework for cross-domain semantic segmentation of urban scenes by exploiting generative adversarial networks. In the proposed multi-level feature alignment method, we first translate images from one domain to another one. Then the discriminative feature representations extracted by the deep neural network are concatenated, followed by domain adversarial learning to make the intermediate feature distribution of the target domain images close to those in the source domain. With these domain adaptation techniques, models trained with images in the source domain where the labels are easy to acquire can be deployed to the target domain where the labels are scarce.

Therefore, the prediction of the duration of traffic jams caused by traffic accidents can allocate traffic resources more reasonably and effectively, release induced traffic information, avoid secondary congestion, and quickly handle traffic accidents. It is of great significance to the rapid rescue of traffic accidents and to eliminate traffic safety hazards. In response to this hot issue, many scholars have done a lot of researches through numerous models, such as probability distribution and time series, and artificial neural networks. However, these models usually only consider temporal features or are based on shallow networks. Therefore, this work adopts a hybrid deep spatial-temporal residual neural network HD-SP-ResNet to predict the traffic volume and velocity, as well as the road congestion duration after traffic accident, so as to monitor and dispatch real-time traffic, response to the postaccidental congestion in time, in order to reduce the various losses incurred by congestion and improve people's satisfaction with traffic on the road.

Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

However, it is non-trivial to evaluate a new transit plan, such as a new bus route or a new subway line, of its future ridership prior to actual deployment, since the travel preferences of passengers along the planned routes may vary. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model passengers' preferences of making various transit choices using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Moreover, we develop a novel inverse preference learning algorithm to infer the passengers' preferences and predict the future human behavior changes, e.g., ridership, of a new urban transit plan before its deployment. We validate our proposed framework using a unique real-world dataset (from Shenzhen, China) with three subway lines opened during the data time span.

Both of them involve transmitters and receivers less than 10 m high inducing a more complex urban environment. This paper presents a framework of integrating composite urban furniture, e.g., traffic signs, traffic lights, etc., into ray-tracing tools. The framework starts with the theoretical modeling for radar cross section of furniture components and validation of full-wave analysis simulation in the far field. Then, in order to locally fulfill the far field condition in the small cells or D2D scenarios, the furniture is divided into small segments so that the models in the far field are still applicable. Finally, the decomposed furniture is implemented in a ray-tracing tool and validated by measurements in real scenarios. Under this framework, researchers can improve the ray-tracing tools with more essential elements of urban environment.

Therefore, UAS density prediction has become an emerging and challenging problem. In this paper, a machine learning-based UAS instantaneous density prediction model is presented. The model takes two types of data as input: 1) the historical density generated from the historical data, and 2) the future sUAS mission information. The architecture of our model contains four components: Historical Density Formulation module, UAS Mission Translation module, Mission Feature Extraction module, and Density Map Projection module. The training and testing data are generated by a python based simulator which is inspired by the multi-agent air traffic resource usage simulator (MATRUS) framework. The quality of prediction is measured by the correlation score and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) between the predicted value and simulated value. The experiment results demonstrate outstanding performance of the machine learning-based UAS density predictor. Compared to the baseline models, for simplified traffic scenario where no-fly zones and safe distance among sUASs are not considered, our model improves the prediction accuracy by up to 15.2% and its correlation score reaches 0.947. In a more realistic scenario, where the no-fly zone avoidance and the safe distance among sUASs are maintained using A* routing algorithm, our model can still achieve 0.822 correlation score. Meanwhile, the AUROC can reach 0.951 for the hot spot prediction. Finally, we extend our UAS instantaneous density prediction model to a continuous prediction framework. By applying the continuous prediction framework, the UAS density prediction time horizon can be significantly increased from 60 simulation cycles to 360 simulation cycles (1 hour), with highest 0.892 correlation score on average.

Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (GCC-MARL) framework, which helps FHVs make distributed routing decisions that cooperatively optimize the system-wide global objective. Specifically, GCC-MARL meticulously assigns credits to agents in the training process to effectively stimulate cooperation, represents agents' actions by a carefully chosen statistics to cope with the variable agent scales, and integrates graph convolution to capture useful spatial features from complex large-scale urban road networks.

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations.

One of the novel aspects of this work has been the development of an efficient signal modelling approach to form a context-aware, flexible system which proved to respond well in urban road scenarios, especially in situations where the driver is likely to have an accident due to impaired performance. Another contribution has been to clarify how HMMs can be used not just to recognize vehicle manoeuvres but also to distinguish an impaired driver from a normal one in complex driving contexts.

At present, most of the existing methods to measure the actual maximum depth of urban road waterlogging are difficult to ensure its accuracy. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper establishes a calculation model to determine the maximum depth of road waterlogging. When the depth cannot be detected by the pressure sensor due to its installation position deviation or its detection zero-point in high value, the model will calculate the maximum depth based on image processing. After the change of depth can be detected by the pressure sensor, these measure values are not only used to identify the model parameters and calculate the current water level, but also used to accomplish the future road waterlogging depth pre-alarming. Finally, a monitoring system for road waterlogging depth is established to realize the pre-alarming based on the smart lamp pole.

In such approaches, traffic light control parameters are not pre-defined, but intelligent agents controlling the junctions learn the suitable traffic signal settings. In order to consider applications of RL in commercial UTC products, they need to enable fine-grained optimization of multiple traffic objectives and be validated in realistic UTC simulations.

10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575140,Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS): A fully probabilistic 3D tracking approach based on 2D detections,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS) is a surveillance system based on a monocular and calibrated video camera that detects vehicles in an urban traffic scenario with dense traffic on multiple lanes and vehicles performing sharp turning maneuvers. UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation.

Moreover, the fuzzy rules are implemented by artificial neural networks to improve control system's robusticity. Splits are calculated based on historical and real-time traffic information. Offsets are calculated by the real-time average speeds. The control layer determines phase composition and adjusts splits at the end of each cycle. The target of this control strategy is to maximize the possibility for vehicles in each direction along the arterial road to pass the local intersection without stop while the utility efficiency of the green signal time is at relatively high level.

Second, aiming at the problem that the threshold range is difficult to determine in the traditional method, the pivot quantity is defined by using the median of the credible sample, and the confidence interval can be estimated to quantify the deviation degree of the sensor data.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively.

To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ &gt; 0.6 up to κ &gt; 0.8).

10.1109/JSEN.2016.2592359,Flash Flood Detection in Urban Cities Using Ultrasonic and Infrared Sensors,IEEE,Journals,"Floods are the most common type of natural disaster, often leading to loss of lives and properties in the thousands yearly. Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities. Since most flood casualties are caused by a lack of information on the impending flood (type, location, and severity), sensing these events is critical to generate accurate and detailed warnings and short term forecasts. However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data. Second, corresponding algorithms have been implemented on a low-power wireless sensor platform, and their performance in water level estimation in a six months test involving four different sensors is illustrated. The results demonstrate that urban water levels can be reliably estimated with error less than 2 cm, and that the preprocessing and machine learning schemes can run in real time on currently available wireless sensor platforms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7516634/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"Oct.1, 2016",ieeexplore

Advancing this notion to the present day, the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a unique opportunity to attempt the same in an increasingly digital landscape. The prevalence and pervasiveness of IoT data streams gives us this ability to represent a situation with clarity and nuance, leading to a refined awareness of the environment. However, there are several challenges in managing the scale, velocity, and magnitude of IoT data streams, as well as the cohesive representation of these varied sources in a single frame of reference. In this article, we present a new algorithm, the deep growing self-organizing map (deep GSOM) algorithm that addresses these challenges. Deep GSOM incrementally generates a latent representation of situational awareness from high entropy to low entropy IoT data streams. It utilizes an implementation of the fuzzy integral to define a metric that can be moved across spatial and temporal situations to profile the density of congestion. We have also expanded deep GSOM into an IoT platform that can collate, aggregate, and process an entire network of IoT data streams. We demonstrate the workings of deep GSOM on the real-life scenario of profiling vehicular and pedestrian movement using IoT data streams of two highly urbanized cities. The results of these experiments confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach for generating situational awareness from multiple IoT data streams.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8960359/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,May 2020,ieeexplore

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of BSS usage data to infer the functions each station has and then get the functions of regions where the station located. Based on the historical trip records dataset of users, a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, is adopted to learn the functions of bike stations.

However, reasonably choosing the signal stations' locations is still an open issue for enhancing people's life quality in the smart city. To this end, we propose the Super Resolution Deduction (SRD) model for solving the signal station selection problem. SRD first initializes the city map as a coarse-grained heat map representing the capacity of the signal stations. Then an image-based super-resolution deduction model is proposed to obtain a fine-grained signal station capacity for deploying.

The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics.

Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator.

Every day, vast no. of citizens are taking part in shaping the smart city using social network by expressing their thoughts, views, feelings &amp; experiences. Although physical sensors planted across the city help to keep eye on the city, it will only answer the question ""What happened"" but the question ""why"" remains unanswered sometimes. In this scenario ""Social Media"" proves to be the goldmine of the information.

10.1109/EIECS53707.2021.9588055,A Traffic Accident Risk Prediction Model Based on Spatial Gated Memory Network,IEEE,Conferences,"The prediction of traffic accidents is becoming more and more important in the field of public safety, especially in travel route planning and road safety deployment. Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction. If it is not solved, it will easily lead to zero-expansion problems, leading to inaccurate prediction results. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a space-gated memory network (SGMN) based on deep learning. The model combines real-time accident risk, real-time traffic flow, and real-time weather with multiple inputs to predict sub-regions with high accident risk. In order to verify the performance of the model, two real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the performance of SGMN is better than that of commonly used memory neural networks such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Convulsion and Hereto-ConvLSTM, which validates the model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9588055/,2021 International Conference on Electronic Information Engineering and Computer Science (EIECS),23-26 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

To address the latter issue, we consider MapReduce to design the back-end Cloud, where intelligent learning and classification algorithms are implemented to detect the stops and transportation modes and provide smartphones with an appropriate GPS sleeping interval based on the GPS statistics on the back-end Cloud. The unique feature of our system is to integrate participatory sensing and Cloud-enabled processing system closely which incorporates knowledge extracted from the Cloud (i.e., transportation modes) into sensing control of smartphones. In this way, sensing control could be optimized through the knowledge behind crowdsourced data.

Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced. Firstly, the value function is approximated by a neural network. Then the parameters are optimized by the policy iteration method, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative error toward set-point. Furthermore, the optimal control law constrained by a saturated operator is implemented based on real-time observations recursively. The neuro-dynamic controller is tested for the two-regional MFD system.

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP).

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals.

This not only causes local traffic chaos but also interferes with the driving efficiency of the entire roads. This phenomenon is a common problem faced by modern metropolitan areas. To reduce the time spent in finding parking spaces, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to effectively improve overall driving efficiency, the systemization of urban roadside or off-street parking has become a key issue that needs attention and demonstration in so-called “smart” cities. In this paper, we have designed and applied an mm-Wave Radar to detect the presence or absence of available parking spaces, and the parking space data can be quickly uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, the status of the parking space can be updated in real-time. Based on this parking space status data, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to conduct deep learning. The input data of this model includes parking space location, parking space status, and parking time factors. Using mm-Wave radar experiment with the trained LSTM output provides parking space status prediction which enables drivers to obtain parking space status before they arrive at the destination.

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This directly translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency.

In this paper, we present an approach for autonomous navigation of cars in indoor structures such as parking garages. Our approach utilizes multi-level surface maps of the corresponding environments to calculate the path of the vehicle and to localize it based on laser data in the absence of sufficiently accurate GPS information.

Simulations carried out using a realistic antenna array radiation pattern, as well as, data from a ray tracing channel model in a dense urban mmWave deployment show that the proposed multiuser scheduler has remarkably good performance, while its algorithmic complexity is kept low. We further quantify the improvements that our SVM-based beam management methods enable by comparison against the conventional exhaustive beam sweeping approach typically employed by 5G NR mmWave implementations.

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation.

EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning. With the accurate long-term prediction of each EV charging station availability, drivers could schedule the charging activities wisely and avoid range anxiety. Data driven models are commonly applied to deal with the similar questions. However, due to the complex charging station distribution with topological road network structure and time-variant charging station availability, many widely used algorithms, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), could only extract the pure time-series information during the model training. One direct effect is that the prediction accuracy decreases rapidly over time.

Therefore, the prediction of the duration of traffic jams caused by traffic accidents can allocate traffic resources more reasonably and effectively, release induced traffic information, avoid secondary congestion, and quickly handle traffic accidents. It is of great significance to the rapid rescue of traffic accidents and to eliminate traffic safety hazards. In response to this hot issue, many scholars have done a lot of researches through numerous models, such as probability distribution and time series, and artificial neural networks. However, these models usually only consider temporal features or are based on shallow networks.

This technology could be manipulated for malicious purposes such as deepfakes, impersonation, or spoofing attacks. We propose a system that has the capability of distinguishing between real and synthetic speech in group conversations.We built Deep Neural Network models and integrated them into a single solution using different datasets, including but not limited to Urban-Sound8K (5.6GB), Conversational (12.2GB), AMI-Corpus (5GB), and FakeOrReal (4GB). Our proposed approach consists of four main components. The speech-denoising component cleans and preprocesses the audio using Multilayer- Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network architectures, with 93% and 94% accuracies accordingly. The speaker diarization was implemented using two different approaches, Natural Language Processing for text conversion with 93% accuracy and Recurrent Neural Network model for speaker labeling with 80% accuracy and 0.52 Diarization-Error-Rate. The final component distinguishes between real and fake audio using a CNN architecture with 94 % accuracy.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82. We show that explicitly dealing with dynamic objects can improve the LiDAR SLAM odometry performance by 39.6% while yielding maps which better represent the environments.

Urban airspace will include many more Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps will also increase.

Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

Traditional water-level sensors for large-scale river can detect water-level rising, though they have limitations in detecting urban river dyke height to alert about flooding. This is a result of various riverside environmental limitations. Additionally, previous prediction methods are difficult to detect CWF flooding with high accuracy because water rising differ depends on a location's environment. Therefore, we propose a detection scheme for CWF by developing a water-level sensor system that works in various installation environments using infrared image processing with both low installation and operation cost. We implemented a CWF prediction system that produces accurate and early predictions using a Linear Regression (LR) of deep learning approach with data assimilation.

Accurate and real-time frontal object perception plays a key role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Vehicles (IV). However, perceiving complex traffic environments, which contain multiple classes of on-road objects with various visual appearances from different viewpoints and partial observations, is still a challenging task. In this paper, a perception system fusing a millimeter-wave (MMW) radar and a monocular camera is proposed. Firstly, the detections of MMW radar are converted to regions of interest (ROIs) on the image. Then, these ROIs are classified by four classifiers using Deformable Part Model (DPM). Finally, a mixer module is used to combine all the classification results and infer the final result for each ROI. The computation intensity of the DPM algorithm can be efficiently reduced through this mechanism. Meanwhile, high detection precision is achievable. Experiment results show that the proposed frontal object perception system can detect and classify on-road objects in complex urban traffic scenarios with 98.4% detection rate at nearly real-time performance (29Hz).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7553978/,2016 35th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),27-29 July 2016,ieeexplore

The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening. The second research activity focus on developing effective and efficient computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

Both of them involve transmitters and receivers less than 10 m high inducing a more complex urban environment. This paper presents a framework of integrating composite urban furniture, e.g., traffic signs, traffic lights, etc., into ray-tracing tools. The framework starts with the theoretical modeling for radar cross section of furniture components and validation of full-wave analysis simulation in the far field. Then, in order to locally fulfill the far field condition in the small cells or D2D scenarios, the furniture is divided into small segments so that the models in the far field are still applicable. Finally, the decomposed furniture is implemented in a ray-tracing tool and validated by measurements in real scenarios. Under this framework, researchers can improve the ray-tracing tools with more essential elements of urban environment. Last but not least, this paper provides a case study to demonstrate the implementation of the framework, and the results show that the traffic signs indeed influence the vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which is one of the most frequently occurring applications of outdoor D2D systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7481737/,2016 10th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP),10-15 April 2016,ieeexplore

To reflect a GNSS signal propagation environment, parameters of a state estimation filter need to be adjusted on-the-fly. A mixed H<sub>2</sub>/ H<sub>∞</sub> filter has been considered here to address the vulnerability of a minimum error variance estimator to measurement outliers. An emphasis between the H<sub>2</sub> filter and the H<sub>∞</sub> filter (minimizing the worst-case error) is continuously adjusted by a reinforcement learning (RL) model. Specifically, a continuous action actor-critic RL model with eligibility traces is implemented. The Cramér-Rao lower bound is considered for the filter performance evaluation allowing for the RL reward computation.

Currently, most autonomous vehicles rely on preconstructed lane maps as designing an algorithmic model is difficult. However, the generation and maintenance of such maps is costly and hinders large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. This paper presents the first self-supervised learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1) a learning-based decision-making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise.

Current research still cannot guarantee a perfect perception, and failure detections may cause collisions, leading to untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. This work proposes a trajectory planner to tolerate the detection failure of the LiDAR sensors. This method will plan the path relying on the detected objects as well as the raw sensor data. The overlapping and contradiction of both perception routes will be carefully addressed for safe and efficient driving. The object detector in this work uses a deep learning-based method, i.e., CNN-Segmentation neural network. The designed trajectory planner has multi-layers to handle the multi-resolution environment formed by different perception routes. The final system will dynamically adjust its attention to the detected objects or the point cloud to avoid collision due to detection failures. This method is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle to drive in an open urban area. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle fails to detect a surrounding object, e.g., vehicles or some undefined objects, the autonomous vehicles still can plan an efficient and safe trajectory. In the meantime, when the perception system works well, the A V will not be affected by the point clouds. This technology can make the autonomous vehicle trustworthy even with the black-box neural networks.

The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener. The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it already learned.

Hence, real time scheduling using optimization methods is not feasible in general. So, an energy management system based on artificial neural network looking one step ahead is presented to minimize the cost of hydrogen and battery degradation. The optimum results of dynamic programming are used to provide a data set used to train an artificial neural network offline which would help solve the problem of real-time implementation. The inputs of the artificial neural network are fuel cell power, the battery state of charge, and the demand forecast; whereas, the output is the fuel cell power. The results obtained by the artificial neural network are compared to those obtained by dynamic programming and found to be very close. The artificial neural network is trained using the standard Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and is able to provide charge sustaining and charge depletion operations. It is also tested on ten percent faster and ten percent slower variations of the same cycle, as well as on the Highway Fuel Economy Test Cycle and New European Driving cycle.

10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00036,Notable Site Recognition using Deep Learning on Mobile and Crowd-sourced Imagery,IEEE,Conferences,"Being able to automatically recognize notable sites in the physical world using artificial intelligence embedded in mobile devices can pave the way to new forms of urban exploration and open novel channels of interactivity between residents, travellers and cities. Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

These problems are caused by uncontrolled human activities and lead to environmental damage. To resolve this problem is by using computerized facilities that can monitor real environmental condition in the form of green open space. The provision of such facilities is enabled by free and accessible Google earth image. However, the information provided by Google earth only shows satellite photos that cannot be used for objects classification of green open space on the surface of the earth. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to classify objects of earth's surface, particularly in urban area, using free and available data from Google earth. The case study of this research includes several cities in Indonesia, while the method employed to classify image-based green open space was Naïve Bayes classifier (NBC). In this paper, training and testing are among two stages used in classifying green open space. Training process is to construct a new structure of NBC model which involves several NBC models.

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of PBEM on two real-life trajectory-based check-in datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006662/,2019 Twelfth International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Network (ICMU),4-6 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

This paper proposes a framework for partial 3D object retrieval and completeness evaluation in an urban street scene based on mobile laser scanning (MLS) point cloud data. The framework consists of three parts. A deep learning method is first used to detect objects from 3D point cloud data. Then, for each detected object, the most similar object in the reference dataset, which contains complete objects, is obtained by a partial 3D shape retrieval method. Last, a completeness evaluation of the detected object is conducted by calculating the completeness index that reflects the integrity of the detected object, and a missing part prediction is given to guide further completion. The proposed framework is validated on the public dataset KITTI and our own point cloud dataset. The experiment includes 3D detection, the partial 3D shape retrieval, and the completeness evaluation.

Whilst artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing to produce more concise and interesting crowd behaviours, the number or sophistication of the algorithms implemented within a system does not necessarily guarantee its perceptual realism. Human perception is highly subjective and does not always conform to the reality of the situation. Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic. Results from the experiment suggest that participants do consider crowd behaviour with social forces to be more realistic.

Current polyphonic SED systems fail to model the temporal structure of sound events explicitly and instead attempt to look at which sound events are present at each audio frame. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is much lower than the segment-wise detection performance. In this work, we propose a joint model approach to improve the temporal localization of sound events using a multi-task learning setup. The first task predicts which sound events are present at each time frame; we call this branch `Sound Event Detection (SED) model', while the second task predicts if a sound event is present or not at each frame; we call this branch `Sound Activity Detection (SAD) model'. We verify the proposed joint model by comparing it with a separate implementation of both tasks aggregated together from individual task predictions.

However, it is highly costly and time-consuming to obtain many travel time data. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm structure to calculate the travel time which utilize neural network to dynamically predict future speed and employ data fusion to integrate the speed data of different detectors in a urban expressway link. Based on the algorithm structure, two practical travel time prediction algorithms, called as Space Discretization Travel Time Calculation Algorithm (SDTCM) and Speed Integral Travel Time Calculation Method (SITCM), were developed by the discretization of the space and integral of the predicted speed. Vehicle plate recognition technology was used to collect the real travel time data in the test section on Beijing Third-Ring urban expressway to evaluate the algorithms. The obtained results show that the average prediction error of two algorithms are both less than 10% which can meet the requirement of the field applications and the algorithms are easy to be implemented as no travel time data collection are needed in advance. The two algorithms have some advantages and disadvantages over each other in accuracy and smoothness.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

Managing these signal control systems at their optimal performance has been an important research focus in traffic engineering. However, various optimization techniques and algorithms developed for adaptive signal control are less effective for real-time implementation in non-lane following heterogeneous road traffic due to the following possible reasons: erroneous demand estimation, time-expensive computations, or uncertainty of getting optimal solutions. Rather, these models work efficiently for homogeneous lane-following traffic where demand predictions are accurate. This work proposes an optimization model that minimizes the total average control delay and finds the optimal green times without any explicit demand prediction for heterogeneous non-lane following road traffic. The proposed solution approach finds the optimal green times and the cycle time in real-time, and the obtained solutions are adaptive to traffic fluctuations.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled.

The solution involves combination of different technologies such as Fuzzy Logic, Wireless Sensor Network, Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Internet of Things, Microcontrollers and high level computing environments. The proposed ideas are capable of adapting to the traffic demands based on real time situations on the road, resulting in efficient utilization of the available road infrastructure. In this paper, an attempt has been made to classify the traffic control signal system deployed at the intersections based on technology adopted and various research contribution for developing ITSS are also summarised.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9315970/,2020 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS),3-5 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Some prior research has looked at how to proactively avoid accidents with safe distancing and driver monitoring, but currently little research has explored strategies to recover afterwards from emergencies, from crime to natural disasters. The current short paper reports on our ongoing work using a speculative prototyping approach to explore this expansive design space, in the context of how a robot inside an AV could be deployed to support first aid. As a result, we present some proposals for how to detect emergencies, and examine and help victims, as well as lessons learned in prototyping. Thereby, our aim is to stimulate discussion and ideation that-by considering the prevalence of Murphy's law in our complex world, and the various technical, ethical, and practical concerns raised-could potentially lead to useful safety innovations.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483964/,2021 Swedish Artificial Intelligence Society Workshop (SAIS),14-15 June 2021,ieeexplore

Considering the ability of fuzzy clustering for data discretization, that of rough sets theory to reduction of decision system, and that of fuzzy neural networks to nonlinear mapping, a novel hybrid neuron-fuzzy inference method that synergies fuzzy c-means (FCM),rough sets theory, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for incident detection was proposed. Firstly, the continuous attributes from detector loop were discretized with FCM clustering. Then, attribute reduction were performed based on rough sets theory using generic algorithm, and the key conditions for incident were determined. Lastly, according to the chosen attribute data, the ANFIS(Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System) was designed for detection. The major advantage of this approach is to optimize the overall structure of ANFIS and avoid the ""dimensional disaster"" with rough sets theory to attribute reduction. The efficiency of the new method is also illustrated by means of applying to real traffic data, the result of the experiment demonstrated that the solution was very effective to increase the recognition rate and to reduce the number of false detections.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4667982/,2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation,18-20 Oct. 2008,ieeexplore
10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00052,SWIMS: the Smart Wastewater Intelligent Management System,IEEE,Conferences,"Wastewater treatment is a critical process in urban and industrial settlements aiming to clean and protect the water as well as the overall environment. Wastewater management systems are conceived explicitly for purifying wastewater, providing clean water efficiently, but this is a hard task due to frequent and quite unpredictable fluctuations of inlet wastewater flows, arising from (random) rain water or (periodical, e.g. day-night) sewage sources, sometimes also leading to failures and outages. To ensure the quality of the clean water out above a threshold and keep the overall system operating, this paper proposes the smart wastewater intelligent management system (SWIMS). It monitors and controls inlet and outlet flows as well as the water quality and parts of the plant as a cyber-physical system (CPS), starting from an Environmental Internet of Things (EIoT) platform. The data generated from the treatment plant is collected in an information system hosted by a server together with an intelligent system that processes this information in a real-time fashion and provides the feedback for optimizing the plant to maintain a good quality of water over time. Such an intelligent system exploits deep learning approaches to control the behaviour of the wastewater treatment system through anomaly detection, supporting decision making on it. SWIMS has been implemented in a real case study deployed in Briatico, Italy. The data and results collected from such a case study are presented, analyzed and discussed in this paper, demonstrating the feasibility and the effectiveness of the SWIMS solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556275/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),23-27 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

Stacked Gaussian process learning is efficient, capable of capturing shared common causes, and can be implemented with any kind of standard Gaussian process regression model such as sparse approximations and relational variants.

After the change of depth can be detected by the pressure sensor, these measure values are not only used to identify the model parameters and calculate the current water level, but also used to accomplish the future road waterlogging depth pre-alarming.

In a previous paper, we proposed a reservation-based system for alleviating traffic congestion, specifically at intersections. This paper extends our prototype implementation in several ways with the aim of making it more implementable in the real world. In particular, we 1) add the ability of vehicles to turn, 2) enable them to accelerate while in the intersection, 3) give a better sensor model and communication-efficient heuristic to our driver agent, and 4) augment their interaction capabilities with a detailed protocol such that the vehicles do not need to know anything about the intersection control policy. The use of this protocol limits the interaction of the driver agent and the intersection manager to the extent that it is a reasonable approximation of reliable wireless communication.

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575140,Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS): A fully probabilistic 3D tracking approach based on 2D detections,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS) is a surveillance system based on a monocular and calibrated video camera that detects vehicles in an urban traffic scenario with dense traffic on multiple lanes and vehicles performing sharp turning maneuvers. UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation. To the best of our knowledge, UTS is to date the only 3D vehicle tracking system in a surveillance scenario (static camera observing moving targets).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9575140/,2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),11-17 July 2021,ieeexplore

The whole control structure includes two layers - the coordination layer and the control layer. Public cycle time, splits, inbound offset and outbound offset are calculated in the coordination layer. Public cycle time is adjusted by fuzzy rules according to the traffic flow saturation degree of the key intersection. Moreover, the fuzzy rules are implemented by artificial neural networks to improve control system's robusticity. Splits are calculated based on historical and real-time traffic information. Offsets are calculated by the real-time average speeds. The control layer determines phase composition and adjusts splits at the end of each cycle. The target of this control strategy is to maximize the possibility for vehicles in each direction along the arterial road to pass the local intersection without stop while the utility efficiency of the green signal time is at relatively high level. The actual application results show the proposed method can decrease the average travel time and average number of stops, and increase the average travel speed for vehicles on the arterial road effectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5554643/,2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation,7-9 July 2010,ieeexplore

In this paper, we investigate and evaluate the performance of thirteen machine learning (ML) algorithms (including multi-target algorithms) employed in conjunction with fingerprint based MT localization for distributed massive multiple input multiple-output (DM-MIMO) wireless systems configurations. The fingerprints will rely solely on the received signal strengths (RSS) from the single-antenna MT collected at each of the receive antenna elements of the massive MIMO base station.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

The timely and accurate travel information of urban residents could assist users in planning their travel strategies and improve the operational efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Currently, the origin-destination (OD) flows of urban residents are formulated as an OD matrix, which is used to denote the travel patterns of urban residents.

We believe that our approach is able to fill the gap between the two kinds of traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches by providing both agent-level implementation and system-level convergence verification. The basic idea of this approach is that agents learn not only from local environmental feedback, i.e., their own experiences and rewards, but also from other agents' experiences.

Tracking an object of interest across the camera network in near real-time is a canonical problem. However, current tracking platforms have two key limitations: 1) They are monolithic, proprietary and lack the ability to rapidly incorporate sophisticated tracking models, and 2) They are less responsive to dynamism across wide-area computing resources that include edge, fog, and cloud abstractions. We address these gaps using Anveshak, a runtime platform for composing and coordinating distributed tracking applications. It provides a domain-specific dataflow programming model to intuitively compose a tracking application, supporting contemporary CV advances like query fusion and re-identification, and enabling dynamic scoping of the camera network's search space to avoid wasted computation. We also offer tunable batching and data-dropping strategies for dataflow blocks deployed on distributed resources to respond to network and compute variability. These balance the tracking accuracy, its real-time performance, and the active camera-set size. We illustrate the concise expressiveness of the programming model for four tracking applications.

Nevertheless, in several real applications, it may be easier to detect a given event from audio information, and the use of audio surveillance systems can greatly improve the robustness and reliability of event detection. In this paper, a novel system for the detection of polyphonic urban noise is proposed for on-campus audio surveillance. The system aggregates different acoustic features to improve the classification accuracy of urban noise. A combination model composed of a capsule neural network (CapsNet) and recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed as the classifier. CapsNet overcomes some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as the loss of position information after max-pooling, and the RNN mainly models the temporal dependency of context information. The combination of these networks further improves the accuracy and robustness of polyphonic sound events detection. Moreover, a monitoring platform is designed to visualize noise maps and acoustic event information.

With advances network infrastructure, smart sensors, and various monitoring technologies, a standardized energy metering infrastructure, called advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), has been introduced and deployed to urban households to allow them to develop efficient power generation plans. Compared to traditional stochastic approaches for time-series data analysis, deep-learning methods have shown superior accuracy on many prediction applications. Because smart meters and infrastructure monitors produce a series of measurements over time, a large amount of data is accumulated, creating a large data stream, which takes much time from data generation to deployment of deep-learning model training.

This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively.

This paper presents a novel object detection network [(context-aware detection network (CAD-Net)] that exploits attention-modulated features as well as global and local contexts to address the new challenges in detecting objects from remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net learns global and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the global scene (at scene level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at object level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware attention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions and features as well as more appropriate feature scales. Experiments over two publicly available object detection data sets for remote sensing images demonstrate that the proposed CAD-Net achieves superior detection performance. The implementation codes will be made publicly available for facilitating future works.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804364/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Among these applications, AMI is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential grids.

It consists of surface-way networks, freeway networks, and ramps with a mixed traffic flow of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Traffic congestions occur frequently, which affect daily life and pose all kinds of problems and challenges. Alleviation of traffic congestions not only improves travel safety and efficiencies but also reduces environmental pollution. Among all the solutions, traffic signal control (TSC) is commonly thought as the most important and effective method. TSC algorithms have evolved quickly, especially over the past several decades. As a result, several TSC systems have been widely implemented in the world, making TSC a major component of intelligent transportation system (ITS). In TSC and ITS, many new technologies can be adopted. Computational intelligence (CI), which mainly includes artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation algorithms, brings flexibility, autonomy, and robustness to overcome nonlinearity and randomness of traffic systems.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas. Finally, we optimise this context-aware proactive load balancing strategy by forecasting the best activation time.

Federated learning is a promising paradigm for distributed edge computing, which enables edge nodes to train models locally without transmitting their data to a server. However, the security and privacy concerns of federated learning hinder its wide deployment in urban applications such as vehicular networks. In this article, we propose a differentially private asynchronous federated learning scheme for resource sharing in vehicular networks. To build a secure and robust federated learning scheme, we incorporate local differential privacy into federated learning for protecting the privacy of updated local models. We further propose a random distributed update scheme to get rid of the security threats led by a centralized curator.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972481/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,July 2020,ieeexplore

Previous works mainly focus on estimating SEAs from peoples' cyberspace behaviors and relationships, such as the content of tweets or the social networks between online users. Besides cyberspace data, alternative data sources about users' physical behavior, like their home location, may offer new insights. More specifically, in this paper, we study how to predict a person's income level, family income level, occupation type, and education level from his/her home location. As a case study, we collect people's home locations and socioeconomic attributes through a survey involving 9 provinces and 85 cities in China.

Extensive experiment results show that: (1) Home location can clearly improve the estimation accuracy for all SEA prediction tasks (e.g., 80.2% improvement in terms of F1-score in estimating personal income level); (2) The proposed H2SEA model outperforms alternative models for SEA inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as Area Under Curve (AUC), F-measure, and specificity; (3) The performance of specific SEA prediction tasks (e.g., personal income) can be further improved if H2SEA only focuses on cities or villages due to urban-rural gap in China; (4) Compared with online crawled housing price data, the area-level average income and Points Of Interest (POI) are more important features for SEA inferences in China.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355035/,Journal of Social Computing,March 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2442584,Estimation of Seismic Vulnerability Levels of Urban Structures With Multisensor Remote Sensing,IEEE,Journals,"The ongoing global transformation of human habitats from rural villages to ever growing urban agglomerations induces unprecedented seismic risks in earthquake prone regions. To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ &gt; 0.6 up to κ &gt; 0.8).

However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data.

10.1109/TASE.2018.2865494,Shared Subway Shuttle Bus Route Planning Based on Transport Data Analytics,IEEE,Journals,"The development requirements of shared buses are extremely urgent to alleviate urban traffic congestions by improving road resource utilization and to provide a neotype transportation mode with good user experiences. The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the “last mile” scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene. Note to Practitioners-This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene, and it is also applicable to other scenes, including commuting scenes, urban transportation hub scenes, and destination scenes of the tourist market. Shared bus operation routes at such scenes are usually aimed at trips with fixed destinations. Existing approaches to planning routes are generally designed for traditional transportation, such as traditional buses and taxis. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic route planning approach (SubBus) based on the operation characteristics of shared subway shuttle buses. We perform a resident travel behavior analysis to improve the accuracy of travel requirement prediction. After that, we combine the prediction results and station properties to gain shared bus optimal routes. We then display how to apply SubBus to optimize shared bus operation status based on crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data generated by Panda Bus Company. We keep a continuous collaboration with the company to optimize the approach details and experimental effects, which demonstrate that our approach can generate effective routes for shared subway shuttle buses to optimize operation status on the “last mile” issue.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457286/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

Based on the conventional features that affect external rail transit passenger flows, we propose an innovative method of statistical features construction to make accurate prediction of frequently fluctuating passenger flow under the framework of machine learning. Firstly, by classifying the statistical features in time-series, we improve the previous long-short-term memory(LSTM) network model and establish a novel long-short-term memory(LSTM) network model that can deal with long-term dependent time-series data so as to accurately fit real-time passenger flow. Secondly, by introducing the lightweight implementation algorithm LightGBM based on the gradient decision boosting tree(GBDT), we build a short-term prediction model, which can reduce operation cost and improve accuracy so that accurate fitting of passenger flow peaks can be achieved. Thirdly, based on K-nearest neighbor algorithm, we select DRS as the dynamic regression device that can find a local optimal fusion method, and establish a LGB-LSTM-DRS local optimal fusion prediction model. Taking the AFC passenger flow data of Chengdudong Station as an example, we predict the short-term passenger flow. Compare with other commonly used models such as LR, RF, and GBDT, it's proved that the LGB-LSTM-DRS model has the smallest error (MAPE and RMSE) and the best prediction performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9195435/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,July 2021,ieeexplore

After being adopted and deployed in more and more cities, the BSSs accumulate increasingly huge usage data (i.e., trip records) which closely relates to the social and economic activities of users in the city. Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of BSS usage data to infer the functions each station has and then get the functions of regions where the station located. Based on the historical trip records dataset of users, a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, is adopted to learn the functions of bike stations. Furthermore, k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster these stations based on their functional profiles. We implement our method using the real-world dataset generated by more than 330 bike stations during three months in capital bikeshare system. The proposed station function discovery method is validated by the analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics on traffic patterns for station clusters and evaluated by the comparison of clustering results with the data of point of interests and station names.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8516903/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an “open” scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets.

The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics. Two flood events from areas with differing degrees of urbanization were considered: Hurricane Harvey flood (2017) in Houston, Texas, and Hurricane Florence flood (2018) in Lumberton, North Carolina.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845339,Using Social Media for Attendees Density Estimation in City-Scale Events,IEEE,Journals,"City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374412/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2822547,Wireless Vehicular Check-in Protocol at Urban Road Intersection,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent organization of the traffic flow at an urban intersection is fundamentally important in intelligent transportation systems. Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator. Its usage brings about 10% improvement in both check-in ratio and packet reception ratio in comparison with the IEEE 802.11p.

The large spectral variability of man-made structures, as well as the mixed pixel phenomenon, imposes the use of computational demanding techniques, which are not always effective for real case applications. Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, which are mainly used for classification and regression analysis. Specifically, a support vector classifier (SVC) constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which separates the training data into different classes. These are then used to classify a whole image, or series of images. The current standard SVM algorithm for classification used by the most popular mapping software (e.g., ENVI, EnMAP) is the C-SVC. The parameterization of a C-SVC strongly affects the final classification result. Yet, there is no rule of thumb to choose the optimal parameters when classifying satellite imagery. Optimal parameterization totally depends on the training data, and to determine it for a specific case, a time-consuming trial-and-error process is inevitable. In this work, advancements for the C-SVC algorithm are proposed to enhance its performance when used to classify remote sensing data, eliminating the need for a part of manual parametrization, while ensuring increasing its performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9180087/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,May 2021,ieeexplore

The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition.

In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions.

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

Traffic flow data from induction loop sensors are essentially a time series, which is also spatially related to traffic in different road segments. The spatio-temporal traffic data can be converted into an image where the traffic data are expressed in a 3D space with respect to space and time axes. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been showing surprising performance in understanding images, they have a major drawback. In the max pooling operation, CNNs are losing important information by locally taking the highest activation values. The inter-relationship in traffic data measured by sparsely located sensors in different time intervals should not be neglected in order to obtain accurate predictions. Thus, we propose a neural network with capsules that replaces max pooling by dynamic routing. This is the first approach that employs the capsule network on a time series forecasting problem, to our best knowledge.

To solve this challenge, we attempt to reduce the tremendous video data using deep learning models in the computational Fog node and optimize the transmission function for high efficiency. To reduce data, we extract video feature and keep salient zones with high resolution meanwhile leave the unavoidable distortion in less important areas.

10.1109/ICITE50838.2020.9231486,A Genetic Algorithm-based AutoML Approach for Large-scale Traffic Speed Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"With the continuous innovation of computer science as well as the big data acquisition technology, machine learning (ML), developed as a state-of-art framework, now has been comprehensively applied in speed prediction tasks. However, ML methods usually require intensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders the practical deployment of ML models. In view of this, this paper proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework for speed prediction, which enables the prediction work to be accomplished in a much more timesaving and convenient way as well as in high prediction accuracy. The proposed framework utilizes the Genetic Algorithm (GA) following its four major procedures: Genome coding, Crossover, Mutation and Selection to automatically search for the optimal neural network architectures and hyperparameters. The proposed framework is examined on a real-world large-scale dataset in the city of Berlin, Germany. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other benchmarking methods by a significant margin. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to show the robustness of the proposed method. This study demonstrates the great penitential of using AutoML in traffic speed prediction and other related transportation applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9231486/,2020 IEEE 5th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Engineering (ICITE),11-13 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICIMIA48430.2020.9074933,A Hybrid Framework for Expediting Emergency Vehicle Movement on Indian Roads,IEEE,Conferences,"Unhindered and smooth movement of emergency vehicles within a city is a crucial aspect of any intelligent transport system. It is common to observe emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire engines obstructed by traffic snarls on Indian roads, especially in the proximity of busy intersections. Existing literature primarily advocates the deployment of RFID technology to terminate the round-robin sequence of the signal system and switch the signal to green in the required direction. However, this technology has proven to be susceptible to electromagnetic interferences and also the economic feasibility is questionable. This paper proposes a model that employs real time image processing and object detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SSD Mobilenet. Unlike a few other architectures, SSD Mobilenet requires very limited computation, hence enabling swift detection. Furthermore, an acoustic signal (sound) processing (pitch detection) algorithm is employed to detect the sirens of emergency vehicles to nullify the potential false positives (e.g. an ambulance in a non-emergency scenario) that creep into object detection using image processing. Both algorithms work in unison, bolstering the accuracy of detection. Upon detection, the signal instantly switches to green, facilitating the expedited movement of emergency vehicles, even in high traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9074933/,2020 2nd International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA),5-7 March 2020,ieeexplore

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects.

Given a service providing information such as location of these stores, they can reduce their time and effort spent by wandering around them because they can go straight to these stores. And they can obtain new purchase opportunities because they can know what kinds of related stores are around them. Thus, they can do efficient purchasing activities. In this paper, we discuss service providing information of related stores efficiently in order to support users' efficient purchasing activities. And we propose an ambient service model that consists of three layers: structured (purchase-related) information space, real-life space, and ambient information space. In this model, a lot of store information collected from the web is grouped and structured automatically by relation in terms of purchasing. And users search information of related stores by using an ambient query that is automatically created by their context in real-life space.

Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution.

For example, it is difficult to figure out which models provide state-of-the-art performance, as recently proposed models have often been evaluated with different datasets and experiment environments. It is also difficult to determine which models would work when traffic conditions change abruptly (e.g., rush hour). In this work, we conduct two experiments to answer the two questions. In the first experiment, we conduct an experiment with the state-of-the-art models and the identical public datasets to compare model performance under a consistent experiment environment. We then extract a set of temporal regions in the datasets, whose speeds change abruptly and use these regions to explore model performance with difficult intervals.

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city.

10.1109/RCAR.2018.8621725,An Image Recognition Approach for Coal and Gangue Used in Pick-Up Robot,IEEE,Conferences,"Picking gangue from raw coal is a crucial step of coal production. Due to the potential for replacing manual workers, the study of pick-up robot is attracting much interest. Pick-up robots usually work in fixed working areas where the types of coals and gangues are unitary. Based on this fact, this paper proposes a simple, fast, and easily implemented approach for coal and gangue classification which is LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) based using gray scale and texture as features. We firstly sampled the image dataset from Han City, Shaanxi province and Jizhong, Hebei province which are two main mining areas in China. The data of Han City consists of the images of lean coal and shale, and the data of Jizhong is coking coal and sandstone. By analyzing the gray scale and the texture of the sampled data, we discover that coal and gangue vary in the parameters including the mean and peak of gray scale, contrast ratio, and entropy. Therefore, these four parameters are chosen as features. We utilize LS-SVM as the machine learning model, and the model is trained with three groups of parameters separately. The first are the mean and peak of gray scale, the second are the contrast ratio and entropy which represents texture features, and the third are the peak of gray scale and the contrast ratio which integrates gray scale and texture features. After evaluation by using our sampled dataset, the model trained by the third group outperforms others. The classification results were 98.7% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Han city, and 98.6% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Jizhong.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621725/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR),1-5 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

Therefore, testing and refining new ATSC systems on actual hardware and under representative traffic conditions prior to field implementation is essential to bridge this gap.

Smart monitoring, which enables the detection and prevention of road traffic accidents, is one promising application of the smart city concept. The deployment of three-dimensional (3D) image sensor networks formed by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices interconnected via a network is a key enabler for smart monitoring. Data collected by image sensor networks for smart monitoring are sensitive because the usage of the data is often related to public safety or law enforcement. Managing sensor data using the blockchain technology is one way to address these sensitivity concerns, as a blockchain network helps prevent data from being tampered with even by the administrators of the system. However, prior works have not considered how to handle streaming data such as image sensor data generated by LIDAR devices in real-time, which means there is a risk of overflow in the network if the data are handled frame by frame. In response to this issue, we propose a blockchain framework for real-time monitoring in a smart city using image sensor networks. Our key concept with this framework is to aggregate hash values converted from multiple frames of image sensor data into one hash value. The proposed framework reduces the number of data `writes' on a blockchain network, thus preventing any overflow. Our framework also enables the estimation of the optimal number of aggregated hash values that minimizes delay while avoiding overflow.

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

The most difficulty in CPGS development is the lack of parking lots data. Without these data, the traditional well-designed parking guidance algorithms will fail. Meanwhile, the real-time location information of automobiles is increasing and can be accessed easily thanks to the popularity of smartphone and smart vehicular devices.

Then we build a spatial-temporal classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with long-short term memory (LSTM) to learn the parking experience from the automobiles uploading the parking locations. Finally, we use the classifier to recommend the proper parking lots nearby to vehicles, considering the related driving context. The experiment shows the proposed method can guide automobiles to the target parking lots accurately even if we do not know the real-time data of the target parking lots. Moreover, the classifier shows the obvious spatial characteristics and preference for the first time when guiding vehicles. This method is a kind of crowdsourcing and encourages automobiles to share their parking experience, to help park easier for themselves eventually.

The efficient learning algorithm and simpler parametric configuration of these alternative modeling approaches make them emerge as a competitive traffic forecasting method for real ITS applications deployed in devices and systems with stringently limited computational resources. An extensive comparison benchmark is designed with real traffic data captured over the city of Madrid (Spain), amounting to more than 130 Automatic Traffic Readers (ATRs) and several shallow learning, ensembles and Deep Learning models. Results from this comparison benchmark and the analysis of the statistical significance of the reported performance gaps are decisive: Deep Echo State Networks achieve more accurate traffic forecasts than the rest of considered modeling counterparts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9294200/,2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),20-23 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564633,Deep Learning Approach for Long- Term Prediction of Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Availability,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic prediction with high accuracy has significance towards traffic facilities scheduling, adaptive traffic control logic, even the urban economic development. EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning. With the accurate long-term prediction of each EV charging station availability, drivers could schedule the charging activities wisely and avoid range anxiety. Data driven models are commonly applied to deal with the similar questions. However, due to the complex charging station distribution with topological road network structure and time-variant charging station availability, many widely used algorithms, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), could only extract the pure time-series information during the model training. One direct effect is that the prediction accuracy decreases rapidly over time. The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) that consists the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) considering edge connectivity and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed to process both spatial and temporal dependence of relevant transportation data in this paper. Then, the spatial-temporal model is deployed on a real testing dataset in Dundee City and experiments show a better performance for EV charging station availability forecasting over a long-term period compared with other baselines and the possibility of real-time application.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564633/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This will result in much lesser traffic congestion due to street-side parking. Furthermore, it will also decrease the hassle drivers face when they have to leave their vehicles on the side of the road to do other activities. The method introduces a Deep Learning based system where parking spaces are detected using Data Capturing Units (DCU). These DCUs feed data into our database which can be accessed by the users from our mobile application. The users can book parking spaces accordingly. All these data are saved in real-time and can be accessed through the mobile application. A vehicle classification system has also been designed that achieves an accuracy of 77% from multiple vehicle classes. Furthermore, a number plate recognition system has been used for the identification and safety protocols of the vehicles in parking sites. The number plate identification system is very precise and achieves an accuracy of over 90% for each digit. To the best of our knowledge, no other system of this kind has been implemented for the city of Dhaka before this. On top of that, successful implementation in a hectic city like Dhaka implies that it can be applied anywhere in the world.

Therefore, LoRa plays a more and more important role in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), which easily extend many large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications in diverse scenarios (e.g., industry, agriculture, city). In lots of environments where various types of land-covers usually exist, it is challenging to precisely predict a LoRa link's path loss. As a result, how to deploy LoRa gateways to ensure reliable coverage and develop precise fingerprint-based localization becomes a difficult issue in practice. In this paper, we propose DeepLoRa, a deep learning-based approach to accurately estimate the path loss of long-distance links in complex environments. Specifically, DeepLoRa relies on remote sensing to automatically recognize land-cover types along a LoRa link. Then, DeepLoRa utilizes Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) to develop a land-cover aware path loss model. We implement DeepLoRa and use the data gathered from a real LoRaWAN deployment on campus to evaluate its performance extensively in terms of estimation accuracy and model transferability. The results show that DeepLoRa reduces the estimation error to less than 4 dB, which is 2× smaller than state-of-the-art models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9488784/,IEEE INFOCOM 2021 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,10-13 May 2021,ieeexplore

10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005655,Detecting Pedestrian Crossing Events in Large Video Data from Traffic Monitoring Cameras,IEEE,Conferences,"Pedestrian safety on the road is a priority for transportation system managers and operators. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these are most needed remains a challenge. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are typically harder to monitor. Current practice often requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is often time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. As a result, target locations are often selected reactively, after serious traffic incidents reveal an underlying safety issue. We propose an approach to use data collected by existing traffic monitoring cameras to automatically identify pedestrian activities on the road. We propose an algorithm to detect pedestrian crossing events based on the detection of individuals on individual video frames using a deep neural network model. Resulting pedestrian locations and movement trajectories can be visualized on a background image, which is automatically extracted at the analyzed location from the video. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with a real-world use case. The case study considered in this work uses cameras owned by the City of Austin, Texas to study pedestrian road use before and after the deployment of a pedestrian-hybrid beacon. We explore qualitative and quantitative metrics to describe pedestrian activity and corresponding changes, which may be used to prioritize the deployment of pedestrian safety solutions, or evaluate their performance. We compared the number of crossing events detected per hour with manually reviewed results from a selected day. The result shows 67 percent overall accuracy, although we observe significant variability across times-of-day. Despite observed limitations, our work illustrates how the value of existing traffic camera networks can be augmented beyond everyday traffic monitoring, and used to collect valuable information on road usage by pedestrians.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005655/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Making an appropriate layoff plan is always quite difficult since a bad job cutting has a serious impact on not only the organization but also the business process executing efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of making an optimal layoff plan with the least influence on the executing of the business process. The key challenge is estimating the process throughput under a layoff plan. We overcome this challenge by two steps: regressing the activity throughput by the stuff number and inferring process throughput by the maximum flow or minimum cut algorithm on the Directed Acyclic Graph of process. In the regressing step, a kernel autoregressive hybrid model is proposed, whose MSE is 30% lower than SVM. After that, an augmenting path based algorithm is introduced to make an optimal layoff plan.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

10.1109/SASO.2014.22,Estimating p-Values for Deviation Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Deviation detection is important for self-monitoring systems. To perform deviation detection well requires methods that, given only ""normal"" data from a distribution of unknown parametric form, can produce a reliable statistic for rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e. evidence for devating data. One measure of the strength of this evidence based on the data is the p-value, but few deviation detection methods utilize p-value estimation. We compare three methods that can be used to produce p-values: one class support vector machine (OCSVM), conformal anomaly detection (CAD), and a simple ""most central pattern"" (MCP) algorithm. The SVM and the CAD method should be able to handle a distribution of any shape. The methods are evaluated on synthetic data sets to test and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, and on data from a real life self-monitoring scenario with a city bus fleet in normal traffic. The OCSVM has a Gaussian kernel for the synthetic data and a Hellinger kernel for the empirical data. The MCP method uses the Mahalanobis metric for the synthetic data and the Hellinger metric for the empirical data. The CAD uses the same metrics as the MCP method and has a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) non-conformity measure for both sets. The conclusion is that all three methods give reasonable, and quite similar, results on the real life data set but that they have clear strengths and weaknesses on the synthetic data sets. The MCP algorithm is quick and accurate when the ""normal"" data distribution is unimodal and symmetric (with the chosen metric) but not otherwise. The OCSVM is a bit cumbersome to use to create (quantized) p-values but is accurate and reliable when the data distribution is multimodal and asymmetric. The CAD is also accurate for multimodal and asymmetric distributions. The experiment on the vehicle data illustrate how algorithms like these can be used in a self-monitoring system that uses a fleet of vehicles to conduct deviation detection without supervision and without prior knowledge about what is being monitored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7001005/,2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems,8-12 Sept. 2014,ieeexplore

10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00009,Flow-Level Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in SDN-Enabled Edge Cloud using Heuristic Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Edge Cloud (EC) is poised to brace massive machine type communication (mMTC) for 5G and IoT by providing compute and network resources at the edge. Yet, the EC being regionally domestic with a smaller scale, faces the challenges of bandwidth and computational throughput. Resource management techniques are considered necessary to achieve efficient resource allocation objectives. Software Defined Network (SDN) enabled EC architecture is emerging as a potential solution that enables dynamic bandwidth allocation and task scheduling for latency sensitive and diverse mobile applications in the EC environment. This study proposes a novel Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based flow-level dynamic bandwidth allocation framework and validates it through end-to-end implementation using OpenFlow meter feature. OpenFlow meter provides granular control and allows demand-based flow management to meet the diverse QoS requirements germane to IoT traffics. The proposed framework is then evaluated by emulating an EC scenario based on real NSF COSMOS testbed topology at The City College of New York. A specific heuristic reinforcement learning with linear-annealing technique and a pruning principle are proposed and compared with the baseline approach. Our proposed strategy performs consistently in both Mininet and hardware OpenFlow switches based environments. The performance evaluation considers key metrics associated with real-time applications: throughput, end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and overall system cost for bandwidth allocation. Furthermore, our proposed linear annealing method achieves faster convergence rate and better reward in terms of system cost, and the proposed pruning principle remarkably reduces control traffic in the network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9590326/,2021 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud),23-25 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/BigData.2018.8622381,Guiding the Data Learning Process with Physical Model in Air Pollution Inference,IEEE,Conferences,"The surveillance of air pollution is becoming a highly concerned issue for city residents and urban administrators. Fixed air quality stations as well as mobile gas sensors have been deployed for air quality monitoring but with sparse observations over the entire temporal-spatial space. Therefore, an inference algorithm is essential for comprehensive fine-grained air pollution sensing. Conventional physically-based models can hardly be applied to all the scenarios, while pure data-driven methods suffer from sampling bias and overfitting problems. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm for air pollution inference by guiding the data learning process with physical model. The quantitative combination of knowledge from observed dataset and a discretized convective-diffusion model is performed within a multi-task learning scheme. Evaluations show that, benefited from physical guidance, our hybrid method obtains higher extrapolation ability and more robustness, achieving the same performance with 1/8 sample amount and obtaining 31.9% less error in noisy synthesized environment.

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

While systems have been developed to enable visibility into parking space vacancies for drivers, most rely on costly, dedicated sensor devices that require high installation costs. The proliferation of inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables the use of compute platforms with integrated cameras that could be used to monitor parking space occupancy. However, even with camera-captured images, manual specification of parking space locations is required before such devices can be used by drivers after device installation. In this paper, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop a method to dynamically identify parking space topologies based on parked vehicle positions. More specifically, we designed and evaluated an occupation detection model to identify vacant parking spaces. We built a prototype implementation of the whole system using a Raspberry Pi and evaluated it on a real-world urban street near the University of Washington campus. The results show that our clustering-based learning technique coupled with our occupation detection pipeline is able to correctly identify parking spaces and determine occupancy without manual specication of parking space locations with an accuracy of 91%.

However, when the road network of the city is very complicated and dense, which is usually the case, it will take too long for the algorithm to find the shortest path. Furthermore, in reality, things are not as simple as those stated in network theory. For instance, the cost of travel for the same part of the city at different times may not be the same. In this project, we have integrated Dijkstra's algorithm with a knowledge-based approach and case-based reasoning in solving the problem. With this integration, knowledge about the geographical information and past cases are used to help Dijkstra's algorithm in finding a solution.

The data was collected in a 2013 experiment involving various drivers traveling on public roads in Ann Arbor, MI. The trips were on suburban roads, city roads and divided highways over a two day period. The vehicular satellite global positioning system (GPS) data from movement over this period was gathered and post-processed to find vehicle paths within 10 meters of one another. The path traces of the two vehicles were combined to simulate what a V2V network would have provided to properly equipped vehicles if such a network and vehicles existed on real road networks demonstrating natural driving behavior. This research harnesses this data to determine the increased effectiveness of a neural network predicting the future path of surrounding vehicles and lane change safety when a V2V network is available. The most studied maneuver is overtaking. To a lesser extent, this paper also provides a view into how a neural network predicts remote vehicle behaviors using a host vehicle equipped with only perceptive hardware and no given information from the remote vehicle.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8628886/,2018 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),18-21 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services. Inspired by the human eye, PDSProxy++ is based on a central cone (foveal vision) and a surrounding smaller circle (peripheral vision), which determine the nearby IoT devices to be initialized. Using a city-wide, real-world smart street lamp dataset and emulations, we show the feasibility of PDSProxy++ and its efficiency: it outperforms the currently-practiced ad-hoc mode and other deployment baselines in different smart city scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9209747/,2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),3-6 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/InnoTek.2014.6877371,Preventing recreational boating fatalities and serious injuries with: The ANN (Assistant Naval Navigator) System Enterprise,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the significant increase in motor vehicle fatalities due to texting while driving, several US States are implementing or drafting laws that will outright ban the use of handheld devices (“I” and cell Phones, pads, business communicators, etc.) while operating a motor vehicle. At the same time, US recreational boaters already are burdened with high numbers of fatal and injurious accidents, and are being encouraged to navigate using Internet-based APPs that require texting. Our analyses of trends in recent US Coast Guard's (USCG's) Boating Statistics<sup>1</sup> seem to support that accidents due to inattention are on the rise. Specifically, owner/operator inattention is causing a higher number of collisions with other recreational boats and these are accompanied by a related rise in fatalities per collision. This observation is in-line with the US Dept. of Transportation findings that texting while driving leads to more violent accidents; therefore, more fatalities/accident. Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction. Also alarming, in 13% of the 4515 accidents the cause was owner/operator inattention. Add to this, in 1010 accidents of the 4,515, these involved a collision with another recreational boat! (That's over 22% of the total accidents). It's shocking to realize that the number of moms, dads, young men and women and children that are dying and seriously injured per year, while enjoying this recreational activity, was nearly equaled the yearly US troop losses and serious injuries during the Iraq war. Over 10 years ago we began our design effort by assembling a team of experts having experience with on-water Emergency Response, and marine-related technologies. By then, the author and his direct associate had accumulated more than 70 years of successful installation and start-up of computer-based control systems for very large and small processes. The applications included major metals, chemical, plastics, ore-processing, underground coal mining industries, as well as, a medical enterprise application. We envisioned how the vessel navigation process may be adapted to feedforward/feedback control system architecture in real time. Proceeding on this basis, our team met frequently with system integrators, boat and engine manufacturers, Boat Owners Association of the US (BoatUS) Execs, towing station owner/operators and US Coast Guard Certified “A” Captains and pilots. In these meetings, our goal continued to focus on a plan for applying advanced control theory to enhance marine vessel navigation. This plan is now in readiness for productization - a viable, developed and US Patented <sup>2</sup> system with primary missions of life-saving and/serious injury prevention. Think of it! Based on our in-depth studies, we project that implementation of our ANN System will reduce the annual average of 750 recreational boating fatalities by 30% (225 fatalities)!

To reduce the network latency, we place the detector module on edge-devices in the cameras.

10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.000-6,Real-Time Traffic Estimation of Unmonitored Roads,IEEE,Conferences,"Due to growing cities, the real-time knowledge about the state of traffic is a critical problem for urban mobility and the road-segments traffic densities estimation influences the efficiency of fundamental smart city services as smart routing, smart planning for evacuations, planning of civil works on the city, etc. Nevertheless, the traffic-related data from navigator Apps (e.g., TomTom, Google, Bing) are too expensive to be acquired. Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

10.1109/EDGE.2018.00028,Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,IEEE,Conferences,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00029,STAD: Spatio-Temporal Adjustment of Traffic-Oblivious Travel-Time Estimation,IEEE,Conferences,"Travel time estimation is an important component in modern transportation applications. The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed graph, then apply Dijkstra-like algorithms to find shortest paths. Travel time is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine, before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of the basic routing engine. Experiments on real trip datasets from Doha, New York City, and Porto show a reduction in median absolute errors of 14% in the first two cities and 29% in the latter.

However, centralized processing of massive video from thousands of cameras in a city is very costly and causes serious problems of privacy protection. Moreover, the labeling of numerous data for supervised training is also infeasible in this scenario. To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-optimizing Memory Network model, namely SoMem, which runs person Re-ID on edge devices in a totally unsupervised and distributed way. Specifically, SoMem adopts a random walk based collaborative training procedure to optimize the visual model on each camera based on locally collected images, and builds a distributed memory network to memorize and match the observed persons by using a distributed mutual ranking algorithm. Based on the cross-camera person matching results learned by the memory network, the visual models on edge devices are further optimized in a self-organized manner. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on several real person Re-ID datasets and deployed on edge devices to show the effectiveness and efficiency of this novel distributed Re-ID model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9288284/,2020 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI),9-11 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

The TSP solution with Hopfield networks is based on the uniqueness constraint. This is, each city must be visited once and only once while trying to minimize the travelling distance. But in real world applications, usually there are other equally important constraints needing to be considered. For example, an ordering constraint on how cities are to be visited. This paper proposes a modified Hopfield neural network architecture that can solve a new class of optimization problem, called ""the picking stone problem (PSP)"". The PSP requires not only the uniqueness but also the ordering constraints. The neural network implementation to solve PSP tends to turn on neurons which satisfy the ordering constraint and this constraint is essential in solving the stereo correspondence problem in binocular vision and can be applied to many other pattern recognition problems.

Vehicle counting, in particular, has become a key element of vision-based intelligent traffic systems deployed across metropolitan areas. Most methods solved the vehicle counting problem under the assumption of state-of-the-art computing systems.

The IoT paradigm, enhanced with intelligence and big data analytics, has found applications in a wide range of solutions such as smart home, smart city, industrial IoT etc. Even though IoT implies that cheap motes can conduct a specific task, thus a large number of them can be deployed, we aim to minimize the installed hardware while we still have a high level of quality of service. Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions. In this paper, we propose a concept of an IoT testbed which allows virtual IoT resources to be immersed and tested in real life conditions, which are met in everyday life.

A wireless sensor network-based approach to detect car positions,IEEE,Conferences,"The global trend of increased urbanization makes space rare in city environments in general and for parking in particular. In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not. In our work, we present a sensor deployment and a machine learning-based approach able to provide the mentioned more fine-granular detection level.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure.

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage).

The problem remains that such trust is notoriously difficult to guarantee in the presence of systematic faults, e.g., non-traceable errors caused by machine learning functions. One way to tackle this issue without making rather specific assumptions about the perception process is plausibility checking. Similar to the reasoning of human intuition, the final outcome of a complex black-box procedure is verified against given expectations of an object's behavior. In this article, we apply and evaluate collaborative, sensor-generic plausibility checking as a mean to detect empirical perception faults from their statistical fingerprints. Our real use case is next-generation automated driving that uses a roadside sensor infrastructure for perception augmentation, represented here by test scenarios at a German highway and a city intersection.

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

In risk analysis of comorbidity on cost, respiratory diseases with a cumulative proportion in the adjusted odds ratio of 36.38% (95%CI: 27.61%, 47.86%) and circulatory diseases with a cumulative proportion in the adjusted odds ratio of 23.83% (95%CI: 15.95%, 35.22%) are the dominant risks of asthmatic patients that affects the treatment cost. It is found that the comorbidity portfolio is robust, and provides a better prediction of the high-cost of treating asthmatic patients. The preliminary characterization of the joint risk of multiple comorbidities posed on cost are also reported. This study will be of great help in improving cost prediction and comorbidity management.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9241012/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,June 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980736,Design and Evaluation of a Reliable Low-Cost Atmospheric Pollution Station in Urban Environment,IEEE,Journals,"The pollution of the air constitutes an environmental risk to health, crops, animals, forests and water. There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in CO<sub>x</sub> sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins.

Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal. The proposed CNN-based system has been tested on both desktop computers and typical WASN devices (such as Raspberry Pi), achieving very fast calculation times that allow real-time operation and a continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096320/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2020",ieeexplore

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972481/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2442584,Estimation of Seismic Vulnerability Levels of Urban Structures With Multisensor Remote Sensing,IEEE,Journals,"The ongoing global transformation of human habitats from rural villages to ever growing urban agglomerations induces unprecedented seismic risks in earthquake prone regions. To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ &gt; 0.6 up to κ &gt; 0.8). Overall, analyzes provide very promising empirical evidence, which confirms the potential of remote sensing to support seismic vulnerability assessment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150321/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,May 2016,ieeexplore

Unfortunately, the hidden information is likely to be predicted by various powerful inference attacks with the rapid advances in machine learning. Then, what is the risk that a user's private information could be disclosed? What countermeasures can be taken to fight against the privacy violation for the user? To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon.

This trend has contributed to foster various location based services deployed on social media, the success of which heavily depends on the availability and accuracy of users' location information. However, only a very small fraction of tweets in Twitter are geo-tagged. Therefore, it is necessary to infer locations for tweets in order to attain the purpose of those location based services. In this paper, we tackle this problem by scrutinizing Twitter user timelines in a novel fashion. First of all, we split each user's tweet timeline temporally into a number of clusters, each tending to imply a distinct location. Subsequently, we adapt two machine learning models to our setting and design classifiers that classify each tweet cluster into one of the pre-defined location classes at the city level. The Bayes based model focuses on the information gain of words with location implications in the user-generated contents. The convolutional LSTM model treats user-generated contents and their associated locations as sequences and employs bidirectional LSTM and convolution operation to make location inferences.

There is no effective solution from a perspective of the fundamental cause to solve the parking problem. At present, it is generally believed that parking guidance systems can effectively alleviate parking problems and provide drivers and traffic managers with real-time and accurate parking information. As one of the prerequisites of the parking guidance system, the accuracy of the short-term parking demand prediction method determines whether the implementation of the parking guidance scheme can effectively solve the parking problem in a certain area. Based on this, we have studied a short-term parking demand prediction in this paper. First, focusing on the distribution of typical parking arrivals and departures regular pattern, a parking demand prediction model was constructed utilizing the Markov birth and death process, and model parameters were calibrated utilizing curve fitting method and undetermined coefficients method. The simulation environment was set up utilizing the Markov process to verify the accuracy of the availability of parameter estimation method.

In this article, we present the methodologies to minimize the efforts of implementing new smart city solutions and maximizing the sharing of components. The final target is to have a live technical community of smart city application developers. The results of this activity come from the implementation of 35 city services in 27 cities between Europe and South Korea. To share efforts, we encourage developers to devise applications using a modular approach. Single-function components that are reusable by other city services are packaged and published as standalone components, named atomic services. We identify 15 atomic services addressing smart city challenges in data analytics, data evaluation, data integration, data validation, and visualization. Thirty-eight instances of the atomic services are already operational in several smart city services. We detail in this article, as atomic service examples, some data predictor components. Furthermore, we describe real-world atomic services usage in the scenarios of Santander and three Danish cities.

After being adopted and deployed in more and more cities, the BSSs accumulate increasingly huge usage data (i.e., trip records) which closely relates to the social and economic activities of users in the city. Therefore, it is possible to take advantage of BSS usage data to infer the functions each station has and then get the functions of regions where the station located. Based on the historical trip records dataset of users, a machine learning algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation, is adopted to learn the functions of bike stations. Furthermore, k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster these stations based on their functional profiles. We implement our method using the real-world dataset generated by more than 330 bike stations during three months in capital bikeshare system.

These multi-modal data are usually transmitted and received by signal stations deployed in the city. However, reasonably choosing the signal stations' locations is still an open issue for enhancing people's life quality in the smart city. To this end, we propose the Super Resolution Deduction (SRD) model for solving the signal station selection problem. SRD first initializes the city map as a coarse-grained heat map representing the capacity of the signal stations. Then an image-based super-resolution deduction model is proposed to obtain a fine-grained signal station capacity for deploying. To be specific, we employ Dense Block to capture the spatio-temporal correlations, C-Attention to selectively enhance useful feature maps, and S-Distribution to impose structural constraints. By sharing the GPS data load with the new deployment of signal stations, we ensure the smart city's efficiency and effectiveness.

Our work is motivated by the observed limitations of utilizing traditional data sources (e.g., social media data and survey data) that commonly suffer from the limited coverage of tourist population and unpredictable information delay. TourSense demonstrates how the transport data can overcome these limitations and provide better insights for different stakeholders, typically including tour agencies, transport operators, and tourists themselves. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based iterative propagation learning algorithm to recognize tourists from public commuters. Taking advantage of the trace data from the identified tourists, we then design a tourist preference analytics model to learn and predict their next tour, where an interactive user interface is implemented to ease the information access and gain the insights from the analytics results. Experiments with real-world datasets (from over 5.1 million commuters and their 462 million trips) show the promise and effectiveness of the proposed framework: the Macro and Micro F1 scores of the tourist identification system achieve 0.8549 and 0.7154, respectively, whereas the tourist preference analytics system improves the baselines by at least 23.53 and 11.44 percent in terms of precision and recall.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8620274/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP).

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy.

Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential dynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head items) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We scrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the current sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding layer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed sequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn suitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this expectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning high-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely recommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES, which aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an embedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the recommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for the head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without an additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves recommendation performance for both tail and head items.

Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities. Since most flood casualties are caused by a lack of information on the impending flood (type, location, and severity), sensing these events is critical to generate accurate and detailed warnings and short term forecasts. However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data. Second, corresponding algorithms have been implemented on a low-power wireless sensor platform, and their performance in water level estimation in a six months test involving four different sensors is illustrated.

To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles.

The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection.

But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people's faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials.As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4].

Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT).

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4). Our investigation and observations indicate major improvements to predict unusual traffic accident event even after model compression and deployment. We have managed to reduce the model size and inference time by ≈ 6x, and ≈ 70 % respectively with insignificant drop in performance. Furthermore, to better understand the importance of each individual type of variables used in our analysis, we have showcased a comprehensive ablation study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556252/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),23-27 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications.

An iterative greedy algorithm is proposed to solve it, which reduces the cost and increases the estimation accuracy at the same time. The experiment shows that the linear correlation coefficient between the estimated value and real value is 0.9488. Our model can also classify PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels with a high accuracy.

This not only causes local traffic chaos but also interferes with the driving efficiency of the entire roads. This phenomenon is a common problem faced by modern metropolitan areas. To reduce the time spent in finding parking spaces, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, and to effectively improve overall driving efficiency, the systemization of urban roadside or off-street parking has become a key issue that needs attention and demonstration in so-called “smart” cities. In this paper, we have designed and applied an mm-Wave Radar to detect the presence or absence of available parking spaces, and the parking space data can be quickly uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, the status of the parking space can be updated in real-time. Based on this parking space status data, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to conduct deep learning. The input data of this model includes parking space location, parking space status, and parking time factors.

Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential dynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head items) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We scrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the current sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding layer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed sequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn suitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this expectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning high-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely recommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES, which aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an embedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the recommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for the head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without an additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves recommendation performance for both tail and head items.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

People usually have tendency to stand outside the bus stop on the road. This blocks the way for the bus to stop in front of the bus stop and so it has to stop in the middle of the road, blocking the traffic. Presented research work is focused to inform and aware people to stand inside the bus stop. For that three different methods are implemented. First one is by using image processing. This is working in real time. It detects the face of people standing on road and raise pre-recorded voice when observed for five second continuously. The second is by using ultrasonic sensors. This will send ultrasonic wave using transmitter and receive the wave from receiver. The time elapsed between the transmission of wave and receiving of wave is entered as an input.

The purpose of designing PRN is to provide as rich information as possible for each single layer. During the training phase, we propose to propagate gradient combinations rather than feature combinations. PRN can be easily applied in many existing network architectures, such as ResNet, feature pyramid network, etc., and can effectively improve their performance. Nowadays, more advanced DCNs are designed with the hierarchical semantic information of multiple layers, so the model will continue to deepen and expand. Due to the neat design of PRN, it can benefit all models, especially for lightweight models. In the MSCOCO object detection experiments, YOLO-v3-PRN maintains the same accuracy as YOLO-v3 with a 55% reduction of parameters and 35% reduction of computation, while increasing the speed of execution by twice. For lightweight models, YOLO-v3-tiny-PRN maintains the same accuracy under the condition of 37% less parameters and 38% less computation than YOLO-v3-tiny and increases the frame rate by up to 12 fps on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239014/,2020 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2),28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

Data reduction technology can reduce network congestion and the transmission power consumption of sensor nodes, and extend the life of WSNs. Inspired by fog computing, this paper proposes a data compression scheme based on fog computing architecture, which uses the synchronous prediction model to achieve data reduction. The fog node constructs a synchronous prediction model by using an auto-regressive analysis method and fits the characteristics of the sensor data so that the data stream can be reduced from the source node. Considering the complexity of the WSN deployment environment, an environment adaptive variable threshold optimization strategy is proposed to improve the availability and performance of the model.

In the IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe individual tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact with the integrated devices and diverse services. Furthermore, IoT is a promising technology to increase the comfort and quality of life and opens new ways of interaction between people and things. Real life applications in healthcare sectors, home automation, industry, smart cities, monitoring scenarios, etc. benefit from the low-cost wireless technology in IoT on one hand. On the contrary, IoT system has many challenging features: many devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory, are highly heterogeneous and their applications continuously transmit transient information. Furthermore, Requesting, delivering and updating the information in IoT are challenging because of the resource limitation. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the latest and the most important Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approaches which uses named data to deliver data in the network. Based on hierarchically structured names, NDN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and uses its communication concept to optimize the power supply and distribute the data efficiently in the network. This paper discusses the main concepts of NDN including naming, routing, forwarding and caching in IoT infrastructure. To achieve an efficient system in different applications scenario in future IoT, an IoT architecture is proposed via NDN called IoT-NDN. The objective of this research work is the design and development of IoT-NDN for different fields in IoT systems. The deployment of IoT-NDN is challenging and requires proper design choices.

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1) a learning-based decision-making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

With the increase of population and crowd density in public transportation hubs of big cities, rapid, automatic, and accurate detection of prohibited items in X-ray scanning images becomes increasingly significant. Therefore, a one-stage detection algorithm, namely an improved You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, is proposed. Firstly, the datasets are put to the the third version of YOLO(YOLOv3) network for iterative training by using a loss function named Distance Intersection over Union (DIoU).

The proposed method consists of three stages of neural networks connected in a modular fashion. The first stage is the detection of license plates (LP); after that, RILP proceeds to detect text regions and performs character segmentations. Finally, to get to the LP number, optical character recognition (OCR) is done via a neural network previously trained for recognition of Persian characters. A robust LPR platform is a vital tool in modern cities for a variety of applications such as autonomous terrific management, surveillance, gateway control and etc. In order to be deployed in real-world conditions, LPR platforms should be practical and adaptive; in other words, easily trainable. RILP has paid attention to this matter as it can be effortlessly trained for any national LP. Only the final module of this approach requires training, which can be done with a simple dataset of the characters used in the LP of the desired country. This gives RILP tremendous portability to be deployed in any country for a wide variety of applications. The proposed platform was designed specifically for complex conditions. Therefore, a very complex and challenging dataset of Iranian LPs was created for a comprehensive evaluation of RILP, consisting of over 350 images of challenging natural conditions.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

10.1109/EDGE.2018.00028,Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,IEEE,Conferences,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

With more globalization and technological advancement, The Internet of Things (IoT) has been matured into self sustaining and evolving technology that has the capacity to change the way how physical and cyber worlds interact. We can also say IoT is about anything that can connect everything. With Involvement of Global Corporations, new IoT-based systems are being proposed in almost every sector which humans have so far envisioned. The thoughts (or Science Fiction) which was once fictional and unbelievable are becoming reality, whatever we desire will be available at touch of our finger someday. Mankind is moving fast towards connected future, where not only autonomous vehicles but entire cities infrastructure will be completely internet connected to support rapid urbanization. To reap the full benefit of IoT, it is imperative that the infrastructure we depend upon is adequate to deliver the services envisioned and has the necessary resilience, robustness and security. IoT can be described as an large scale, heterogeneous, ultra-complex Ecosystem acting as bridge between cyber and physical worlds. Recently, the Distributed Ledger Technology (Blockchain and Block less-different implementation of Data Structures with cryptographic algorithmic functions) has gained much attention in IoT solutions from security perspective.

The availability of commodity sensors and the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) enable the deployment of a city-wide network of 1000's of low-cost real-time air quality monitors to help manage this challenge. This needs to be supported by an IoT cyber-infrastructure for reliable and scalable data acquisition from the edge to the Cloud. The low accuracy of such sensors also motivates the need for data-driven calibration models that can accurately predict the science variables from the raw sensor signals. Here, we offer our experiences with designing and deploying such an IoT software platform and calibration models, and validate it through a pilot field deployment at two mega-cities, Delhi and Mumbai. Our edge data service is able to even-out the differential bandwidths from the sensing devices and to the Cloud repository, and recover from transient failures.

10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00029,STAD: Spatio-Temporal Adjustment of Traffic-Oblivious Travel-Time Estimation,IEEE,Conferences,"Travel time estimation is an important component in modern transportation applications. The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed graph, then apply Dijkstra-like algorithms to find shortest paths. Travel time is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine, before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of the basic routing engine. Experiments on real trip datasets from Doha, New York City, and Porto show a reduction in median absolute errors of 14% in the first two cities and 29% in the latter. We also show that STAD performs better than different commercial and research baselines in all three cities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162240/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated.

10.1109/CSR51186.2021.9527947,Secure Communication in Smart Meters using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Digital Signature Algorithm,IEEE,Conferences,"With the advancement in the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT), its number of applications has also increased such as in healthcare, smart cities, vehicles, industries, household appliances, and Smart Grids (SG). One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

Also, it must be network synchronized, in order for each signalling time modification to be correlated with the other junctions in the network. The system must also be able to properly respond to special traffic events, meaning that all the vehicles “neglected” at some point must be considered with priority at a later moment, in order to avoid long queue formation, even on secondary roads. A model for traffic management system evaluation is useful both for didactic purpose and for existent systems' evaluation, by monitoring their responses to different scenarios and determining their efficiency. Obviously, for the big cities (and not only) congested traffic, may occur many situations that cannot be anticipated at system installation time. Therefore, the main purpose for a traffic management system evaluation model may be to determine the system's responses in special situations which, however small their probability is, can negatively affect the traffic on a large area of the network and hence the implemented system cannot counter-balance the perturbation incurred in a short time manner.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7861131/,"2016 8th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)",30 June-2 July 2016,ieeexplore

The TSP solution with Hopfield networks is based on the uniqueness constraint. This is, each city must be visited once and only once while trying to minimize the travelling distance. But in real world applications, usually there are other equally important constraints needing to be considered. For example, an ordering constraint on how cities are to be visited. This paper proposes a modified Hopfield neural network architecture that can solve a new class of optimization problem, called ""the picking stone problem (PSP)"". The PSP requires not only the uniqueness but also the ordering constraints. The neural network implementation to solve PSP tends to turn on neurons which satisfy the ordering constraint and this constraint is essential in solving the stereo correspondence problem in binocular vision and can be applied to many other pattern recognition problems.

This paper presents the design and implementation of an edge analytics application that uses RPI as an edge device. The Isolation Forest algorithm was first used to detect shading anomalies. A Siamese neural network was then trained to create a latent-space mapping. An anomaly detection model based on the latent space and a neural network and kNN was developed.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure.

The problems are the k-shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially processing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that the MRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than ~2% and 0.5% that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6709796/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Aug. 2014,ieeexplore

For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61 m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259458/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted.

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon.

To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism.

Recently, since intelligent surveillance was applied in all kind of smart city services, object tracking attracted more attention. However, two serious problems blocked the development of visual tracking in real applications. The first problem is its lower performance under intense illumination variation, while the second issue is its slow speed. This paper addressed these two problems by proposing a correlation filter-based tracker. Fog computing platform was deployed to accelerate the proposed tracking approach. The tracker was constructed by multiple positions' detections and alternate templates. The detection position was repositioned according to the estimated speed of target by an optical flow method, and the alternate template was stored with a template update mechanism, which is all computed at the edge. Experimental results on large-scale public benchmark data sets showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8357547/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from $2.52 to $0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106% to 14%, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068215/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld.

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

The successful application of edge computing in the IoT will make our algorithms faster, more convenient, lower overall costs, providing better business practices, and enhance sustainability. Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area. According to the detected facial feature points, we could calculate the values of AU, and then use classification algorithms for emotion recognition. In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production.

Under this light, positioning services that harvest location fingerprinting based on received signal strength indications (RSSIs) are widely popular due to the massive data generation that IoT settings provide. However, the labor-intensive and repetitive task of the radio map construction through offline RSSI fingerprint collection prevents such services from becoming standard equipment for future smart facilities. In this paper, we present a location-aware infrastructure that combines a broad sensing layer, edge computing, and centralized cloud federation support. Our setting gives rise to a sensing mechanism that enables in-facility crowdsourcing able to aid fingerprinting localization services.

This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios. This is shown through significant improvements in the cumulative regret as well as the instantaneous delay, compared to the case where all newly-appeared FNs are explored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8847117/,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),29 July-1 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

In order to advanced provision resources, we need to predict the mobility patterns of the consumers so that this can be done in an efficient fashion. To predict the mobility pattern of the user equipment's (UE's) one tends to fit a single ML/AI model and deploy it in the network. In real life, there can be more than one underlying pattern in the data and a single model need not be necessarily generalizable. Also, in some cases, the underlying mobility pattern may change with time which is known as concept drift. If the distribution change is beyond a threshold, it is better to retrain the model to generalize it for the new set of data and it is a costly exercise. However, in the case of multiple models, the problem is complex, and confusion arises on which model to retrain when the concept drift is detected. In this work, we propose a new method to handle concept drift in the multiple model scenario and further advise which model to retrain once the concept drift is detected. This mechanism can be used to generate accurate results without costly retraining on the model multiple times even when the underlying distribution changes rapidly.

However, coverage extension faces crucial challenges such as user mobility and determining the best coordinates for new base station deployment. In this paper, we address this problem based on the prediction of users' spatial distribution that allows Aerial base stations (ABS) to adjust their position accordingly. We first analyze the performance of two machine learning schemes (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based encoder-decoder and self-attention-based Transformer) for user mobility prediction based on a real DataSet. Then, we use these schemes to enhance the ABS deployment algorithm. Numerical results reveal significant gains when applying the proposed mobility prediction models over traditional deployment algorithms.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster. Collectively, the paper concludes that the proposed rebalancing approach is effective under various demand scenarios and will benefit both travelers and operators if implemented in shared mobility-on-demand systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8317908/,2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),16-19 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

In ZigBee networks, a tree topology is often used to construct a wireless sensor network for data delivery applications. However, delivery failures constantly occur in ZigBee wireless applications due to node movements and network topology changes. The conventional route reconstruction method is designed to mitigate the effects of topology changes, but it consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, we exploit the regularity in node mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and ensure that the transmission of data to mobile nodes is efficient. To increase the data delivery ratio and mitigate the effects of packet loss caused by the node mobility, we propose a ZigBee node deployment and tree construction framework. In particular, the framework considers the regularity in mobility patterns during the construction of the routing tree and deployment of nodes. It also includes an overhearing mechanism for mobile nodes to further improve the data delivery ratio. We present details of the proposed algorithms for node deployment and tree construction in the framework.

This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios. This is shown through significant improvements in the cumulative regret as well as the instantaneous delay, compared to the case where all newly-appeared FNs are explored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8847117/,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),29 July-1 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

However, the process of predicting link quality (LQ) is nontrivial due to the streaming and dynamic nature of radio wave propagation, which is complicated by robot mobility. Due to robot movement, the wireless propagation environment can change considerably in terms of distance, obstacles, noise, and interference. Therefore, LQ must be learned and regularly updated while the robot is online. However, the existing fuzzy-based models for assessing LQ are non-adaptable due to the absence of any learning mechanism. To address this issue, we introduce a fuzzy-based prediction model designed for the efficient online and incremental learning of LQ. The unique approach uses fuzzy logic to infer LQ based on the collective output from a series of offset classifiers and their posterior probabilities. In essence, the proposed model leverages machine learning for extracting the underlying functional relationship between the input and output variables, but deeper inferences are made from the output of the learning algorithms using fuzzy logic. Wireless link data from a real-world robot network was used to compare the model with the traditional linear regression approach. The results show statistically significant improvements in three out of the six real-world indoor and outdoor environments where the robot operated. Additionally, the novel approach offers a number of other benefits, including the flexibility to use fuzzy logic for model tuning, as well as the ability to make implementation efficiencies in terms of parallelization and the conservation of labeling resources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7849899/,2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),6-9 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore

One of the biggest challenges in the smart mobility domain is the use of data science as an enabler for the implementation of large scale transportation sharing solutions. In particular, the next generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) requires the combination of artificial intelligence and discrete simulations when exploring the effects of what-if decisions in complex scenarios with millions of users. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an innovative data modelling framework that can be used for ITS related problems. We demonstrate that the use of graphs and time series in multi-dimensional data models can satisfy the requirements of descriptive and predictive analytics in real-world case studies with massive amounts of continuously changing data. The features of the framework are explained in a case study of a complex collaborative mobility system that combines carpooling, carsharing and shared parking.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive deployment strategy for UAV-aided networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning, where a UAV can adjust its movement direction and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through hybrid deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism.

However, edge caching requires suitable strategies for determining what files to pre-fetch at which cell and at what time. Due to the heterogeneity of users' content preferences and mobility, caching based only on popularity has limitations. Considering that cells located in different places have different predictability, in this paper, we propose an adaptive edge caching algorithm based on content popularity as well as the individual's prediction results to provide an optimal caching strategy, aiming to maximize the cache hit rate with acceptable file replacement cost. A heuristic optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms is presented, along with a prediction model based on an improved Markov model for each user according to the historical data. In the model, similar users are clustered based on their behavior patterns. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulation dataset as well as a 3-week real-life dataset from China Mobile.

To address this, we propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas on the terrain with fine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution.

Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the “obstacles” on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency.

In order to advanced provision resources, we need to predict the mobility patterns of the consumers so that this can be done in an efficient fashion. To predict the mobility pattern of the user equipment's (UE's) one tends to fit a single ML/AI model and deploy it in the network. In real life, there can be more than one underlying pattern in the data and a single model need not be necessarily generalizable. Also, in some cases, the underlying mobility pattern may change with time which is known as concept drift. If the distribution change is beyond a threshold, it is better to retrain the model to generalize it for the new set of data and it is a costly exercise. However, in the case of multiple models, the problem is complex, and confusion arises on which model to retrain when the concept drift is detected. In this work, we propose a new method to handle concept drift in the multiple model scenario and further advise which model to retrain once the concept drift is detected.

10.1109/WAINA.2016.80,DASITS: Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System,IEEE,Conferences,"The growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, lead to increase in the number of road traffic accidents. These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment. In this paper we propose a Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System based on the speed of vehicles, for effective lane changing in the dynamic mobility model. In our approach we present the lane changing based system on speed and minimum gap between the vehicles. The paper focuses towards the development of an Intelligent Transportation System that provides timely, reliable information to the drivers and the concerned authorities. The test bed is created on the techniques used in the proposed system where the analysis takes place in the On Board Embedded System designed for Vehicle Navigation. The designed system was tested on a Four Lane road at Neemrana in India. Successful simulations have been conducted along with real time network parameters to maximize the QoS (quality of service) and performance using SUMO and NS-2.

Network-wide monitoring has increased importance in the current and future panorama due to the verge of adoption of smart mobility technologies, i.e. monitoring all links in a network is a general desired goal.

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw EMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our approach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with TensorFlow deep learning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics processing units of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate the ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw EMG signals. We anticipate our EMG-based control system to be a starting point to design more sophisticated prosthetic hands. For example, a pressure measurement unit can be added to transfer the perception of the environment to the user.

Service selection is a process to choose services that meet the functional and non-functional properties for each user. Some of the features of the IoT environment make this process more complicated. For example, user's mobility constantly changes the connected service collections. Because the dynamic nature of the environment leads to changes in the QoS (quality of service), judging a service that satisfies the needs of users in the future is difficult based on previous QoS static values. Moreover, an IoT service relies on its device, which is affected by CPU processing power and battery capacity. Hence, long-term and stable service cannot be provided to users. In order to solve the above problems, we need a service selection method that can consider the quality of the service and reflect the service context in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT service selection approach by using the linear reward inaction (LRI) algorithm to learn all subjective assessments from the latest user feedback and objective assessments of service. In addition, to reduce the effect of unreasonable feedback from users in different contexts, the similarity between users is considered in the LRI algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862134/,"2019 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)",28-31 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

However, MECs must cope with several challenges that do not arise in the context of conventional cloud platforms. These include the potentially highly distributed geographical deployment, heterogeneity, and limited resource capacity of Edge Data Centers (EDCs), and end-user mobility. In this paper, we present an elasticity controller to help MECs overcome these challenges by automatic proactive resource scaling. The controller utilizes information on the physical locations of EDCs and the correlation of workload changes in physically neighboring EDCs to predict request arrival rates at EDCs. These predictions are used as inputs for a queueing theory-driven performance model that estimates the number of resources that should be provisioned to EDCs in order to meet predefined Service Level Objectives (SLOs) while maximizing resource utilization. The controller also incorporates a group-level load balancer that is responsible for redirecting requests among EDCs during runtime so as to minimize the request rejection rate. We evaluate our approach by performing simulations with an emulated MEC deployed over a metropolitan area and a simulated application workload using a real-world user mobility trace. The results show that our proposed pro-active controller exhibits better scaling behavior than a state-of-the-art re-active controller and increases the efficiency of resource provisioning, thereby helping MECs to sustain resource utilization and rejection rates that satisfy predefined SLOs while maintaining system stability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355585/,2020 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC),12-14 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online.

Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise.

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties. The proposed system is evaluated in a comprehensive field evaluation campaign within an experimental live deployment on a German highway, where it is able to achieve a binary classification success ratio of more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 89.15% for a fine-grained classification task with nine different classes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8569391/,2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),4-7 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

However, the problem of assigning tasks over devices becomes challenging in the dynamic environments encountered in real-world settings, considering that the resource availability and channel conditions change over time in unpredictable ways due to mobility and other factors. In this paper, we formulate the task assignment problem as an online learning problem using an adversarial multi-armed bandit framework. We propose MABSTA, a novel algorithm that learns the performance of unknown devices and channel qualities continually through exploratory probing and makes task assignment decisions by exploiting the gained knowledge. The implementation of MABSTA, based on Gibbs Sampling approach, is computational-light and offers competitive performance in different scenarios on the trace-data obtained from a wireless IoT testbed. Furthermore, we prove that MABSTA is 1-competitive compared to the best offline assignment for any dynamic environment without stationarity assumptions, and demonstrate the polynomial-time algorithm for the exact implementation of the sampling process.

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models.

To understand the behavior of end users, our first contribution is the proposition of a data warehouse solution to store the large amount of data generated by sensors.

Previous approaches commonly assume that adequately long and fixed periods of candidate participants' historical mobility trajectories are available before the selection process. This enables the frameworks to accurately model mobility which enables the optimization of selection. However, this assumption may not be realistic for newly-released MCS applications or platforms because the candidates have just boarded without previous mobility profiles. The sparsity or even absence of mobility traces will incur inaccurate location prediction of the individual participant, thus imposing negative effects on the participant selection process and hindering the practical deployment of new MCS applications. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem called ""From-Scratch MCS"" (FS-MCS for short), in which we study how to intelligently select participants to minimize such ""cold-start"" effect. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning, which we name RL-Recruiter. With the gradual accumulation of mobility trajectories over time, RL-Recruiter can make a good sequence of participant selection decisions for each sensing slot by incrementally extracting and utilizing the collective mobility patterns of all candidate participants, thus avoiding the prediction of individual participant's location that is very inaccurate when the training data is sparse.

UASs have high mobility, are easily deployed, and capable of real-time monitoring of crowd behavior by utilizing multi-sensor-based detection and remote sensing of objects. These capabilities make UASs a very useful tool for Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT) applications, such as Law Enforcement (LE), capitalizing on Human Factors (HF). This study examines the concept of leveraging drone technology together with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to produce a UAS system that can assist LE in the monitoring and assessment of crowd behaviors during peaceful and non-peaceful events. LE agencies are increasingly being tasked with engaging in dynamic environments that exist at public events. Utilized as a force multiplier and autonomous tool, would benefit from an AI-UAS platform utilizing artificial intelligence assisting in identifying behavior of peaceful people as opposed to malevolent participants or instigators that may attempt to take control. AI-UASs of this type would allow LE to leverage existing resources within their organizational structures and provide increased situation awareness via a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) broadcast and monitoring of these dynamic environments. Information provided from these AI-UAS systems would provide real-time information to field forces as well as command and control operations that may be remotely located. AI-UAS Sensors can be dynamically allocated as needed for monitoring/documenting crowd behavior and police actions. Video recordings would provide evidence in court as well counter truth-bending recordings published by professional protestors and agenda driven main-stream media outlets.

10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.000-6,Real-Time Traffic Estimation of Unmonitored Roads,IEEE,Conferences,"Due to growing cities, the real-time knowledge about the state of traffic is a critical problem for urban mobility and the road-segments traffic densities estimation influences the efficiency of fundamental smart city services as smart routing, smart planning for evacuations, planning of civil works on the city, etc. Nevertheless, the traffic-related data from navigator Apps (e.g., TomTom, Google, Bing) are too expensive to be acquired. Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it. The proposed reconstruction model has been created by exploiting open and real-time data in the context of Sii-Mobility research project by using Km4City infrastructure in the area of Florence, Italy, for its corresponding Smart City solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8512000/,"2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)",12-15 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster. Collectively, the paper concludes that the proposed rebalancing approach is effective under various demand scenarios and will benefit both travelers and operators if implemented in shared mobility-on-demand systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8317908/,2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),16-19 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

Although some methods, such as extended speech act theory (ESAT), have been used to handle this issue, some problems still remain unsolved such as how to define and process the negotiation workflow, how to handle the complex interactions among distributed users, and how to define the reconciliation objects. The multi-agent system, which has special features in adaptivity, autonomy, collaborative behavior, mobility and so on, has the potential to help solve these problems in collaborative computing, shared knowledge and rules, and complex communication, negotiation and voting. In this paper, multi-agent method is used to solve reconciliation of inconsistent perspectives in a real-time collaborative 3D environment. First, an application-based ontology is created to define the system-wide status including user profiles, user behaviors, system functions and status, and data and data sources. These statuses will be understandable by all the parties in the system. The reconciliation objects are also derived from the ontology. Second, multiple users' negotiation process is simulated and is modeled based on the agent communication protocol from the foundation for intelligent physical agents (FIPA). Third, assistant agent and other agents are designed and developed to deploy the reconciliation process. A prototype system has been developed, which is structured into two layers: multi-agent system layer and shared 3D view layer.

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations.

This work performs the implementation of a counting system for mobility actors like cars, pedestrians, motorcycles, bicycles, buses, and trucks in the context of an Edge computing application using deep learning. However, the implementation of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection in low-capacity embedded devices make it difficult to perform tasks that require high processing or must be carried out in real time. To solve this problem this study presents the analysis and implementation of different techniques based on the use of an additional hardware element as is the case of a Vision Processing Unit (VPU) in combination with methods that affect the resolution, bit rate, and time of video processing. For this purpose we consider the Mobilenet-SSD model with two approaches: a pre-trained model with known data sets and a trained model with images from our specific scenarios. The use of SSD-Mobilenet's model generates different results in terms of accuracy and time of video processing in the system. Results show that the use of an embedded device in combination with a VPU and video processing techniques reach 18.62 Frames per Second (FPS).

In this proposed solution we have used many open source stacks and frameworks for video and AI processing. The processing of the video pipeline and algorithms take full advantage of the pipelining and parallelism using all the heterogenous cores of the Xilinx MPSoC. In addition, we have developed an extensible, scalable, adaptable and configurable AI backend framework, XTA, for acceleration purposes that is derived from a popular, open source AI backend framework, TVM-VTA. XTA uses all the MPSoC cores for its computation in a parallel and pipelined fashion. XTA also adapts to the compute and memory parameters of the system and can scale to achieve optimal performance for any given AI problem. The FSD system design is based on a distributed system architecture and uses open source components like Autoware for autonomous driving algorithms, ROS and Distributed Data Services as a messaging middleware between the functional nodes and a real-time kernel to coordinate the actions. The details of image capture, rendering and AI processing of the vision perception pipeline will be presented along with the performance measurements of the vision pipeline.In this proposed solution we will demonstrate some of the key use cases of vision perception unit like surround vision and object detection.

To accommodate these demands, 5G requires extreme densification of base station deployment, which will result in a network that requires overwhelming efforts to maintain and manage. User mobility prediction in wireless communications can be exploited to overcome these foregoing challenges. Knowledge of where users will go next enables cellular networks to improve handover management. In addition, it allows networks to engage in advanced resource allocation and reservation, cell load prediction and proactive energy saving. However, anticipating the movement of humans is, in itself, a challenge due to the lack of realistic mobility models and insufficiencies of cellular system models in capturing a real network dynamics.

The MR data is generated by mobile objects while connecting to data services and is stored in backend data centers. To geo-tag or localize such MR data is believed to have a profound effect on the analytics and optimizations of telco and traffic networks. However, MR records are of noisy and partial observations regarding to mobile objects' geo-locations and hence pose challenges to accurate telco data localization. There have been quite a few attempts. Single-point localization methods map a MR record to a location, but come out with limited accuracies due to the ignorance of spatiotemporal coherence of successive MR records. Recent efforts on sequential localization techniques alleviate this by mapping a sequence of MR records to a trajectory. However, existing solutions are often with assumptions on specific models, e.g., mobility and signal strength distributions, or priori knowledge on topology space, e.g., road networks, limiting the deployment in practice. To this end, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle the challenges in sequential telco localization. We solely use raw MR records and a public third-party GPS dataset for the learning of the correlations between mobile objects' locations and MR records, requiring no model assumptions and priori knowledge. To handle the data-intensive workloads during the learning process, we use materialized views for efficient online localization and light-weighted indexing techniques for periodical parameters tuning, in order to improve the efficiency and scalability. Results on real data show that our solution achieves 58.8 percent improvement in median localization errors compared with state-of-art sequential localization techniques that require hypothesis models and priori knowledge, making our solution superior in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and employability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939387/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

In ZigBee networks, a tree topology is often used to construct a wireless sensor network for data delivery applications. However, delivery failures constantly occur in ZigBee wireless applications due to node movements and network topology changes. The conventional route reconstruction method is designed to mitigate the effects of topology changes, but it consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, we exploit the regularity in node mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and ensure that the transmission of data to mobile nodes is efficient. To increase the data delivery ratio and mitigate the effects of packet loss caused by the node mobility, we propose a ZigBee node deployment and tree construction framework. In particular, the framework considers the regularity in mobility patterns during the construction of the routing tree and deployment of nodes. It also includes an overhearing mechanism for mobile nodes to further improve the data delivery ratio. We present details of the proposed algorithms for node deployment and tree construction in the framework.

In the considered model, the network can leverage human-centric information, such as users' visited locations, requested contents, gender, job, and device type to predict the content request distribution, and mobility pattern of each user. Then, given these behavior predictions, the proposed approach seeks to find the user-UAV associations, the optimal UAVs' locations, and the contents to cache at UAVs.

With mobile edge computing, microservices can be further deployed in edge clouds dynamically, launched quickly, and migrated across edge clouds easily, providing better services for users in proximity. However, the user mobility can result in frequent switch of nearby edge clouds, which increases the service delay when users move away from their serving edge clouds. To address this issue, this article investigates microservice coordination among edge clouds to enable seamless and real-time responses to service requests from mobile users. The objective of this work is to devise the optimal microservice coordination scheme which can reduce the overall service delay with low costs. To this end, we first propose a dynamic programming-based offline microservice coordination algorithm, that can achieve the globally optimal performance. However, the offline algorithm heavily relies on the availability of the prior information such as computation request arrivals, time-varying channel conditions and edge cloud's computation capabilities required, which is hard to be obtained. Therefore, we reformulate the microservice coordination problem using Markov decision process framework and then propose a reinforcement learning-based online microservice coordination algorithm to learn the optimal strategy. Theoretical analysis proves that the offline algorithm can find the optimal solution while the online algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, based on two real-world datasets, i.e., the Telecom's base station dataset and Taxi Track dataset from Shanghai, experiments are conducted.

We are going to optimize the UAV relay deployment, aiming to maximize the capacity of the relay network. Considering the channel model and exact positions of ground users are priori unknown, the problem of deployment optimization can't be solved directly because of lacking parameters.

The optimal relay deployment is acquired via online learning and iteration without the knowledge of channel model and exact positions of the users but with the real-time measurement of relay capacity, thus the proposed model-free deployment approaches can be adaptive to the practical communication environment compared to the model-based optimization.

CPSs are a modern generation of systems with synergic cooperation between computational and physical potentials that can interact with humans through several new mechanisms.

To compensate for the severe loss and attenuation, beamforming training is used to determine the optimal beam direction and thereby improve directional transmission power. However, the training overhead will be significantly increased with narrower beams, particularly under conventional exhaustive schemes. Therefore, we propose a learning-based adjustable beam number training (LABNT) scheme to intelligently and flexibly select beam training candidates considering different user mobility and hybrid line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. In LABNT, several deep learning networks are parallelly constructed and connected to a reinforcement learning network to determine training candidates dynamically based on performance rewards. A novel enhanced feature selection method, that is, uniformly distributed mutual information, is developed based on the correlation of historical results to select the beam inputs for each deep learning network. In simulations, the proposed LABNT outperforms other existing schemes in terms of beam alignment accuracy, training latency, and system throughput. Moreover, following the IEEE 802.11ad/ay protocols, we implement realistic mmWave beamforming training on a programmable hardware platform with integrated 60 GHz wireless-gigabit (WiGig) transceiver devices. The experimental results on the WiGig platform demonstrate that the proposed LABNT scheme can achieve real-time performance with approximately Gbps transmission throughput and millisecond-level training overhead.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9353271/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,March 2021,ieeexplore

Typically, UAVs are used as supplementary access points to existing ground infrastructure to extend network coverage and capacity. Therefore, finding the optimal position for each UAV is a crucial task that can be resolved by multiobjective optimization. In this paper, a self-organizing UAV swarm model is introduced as an evolutionary type of heuristic that can be adjusted in real time based on the network’s key performance indicators (KPIs). The exogenous dynamics of the wireless communication system are reflected by an end-user mobility model based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. To achieve versatility in the positioning of UAVs, a model of virtual forces is adopted to enable control of the movement of each UAV via a collection of persistent and mutable parameters of the system. Evolution is controlled by eleven strategic versions of parametric mutations, including a neutral benchmark process. The simulation results reveal that the suggested solution allows for a substantial increase in the KPI efficiency metrics relative to those of the nonmutated system. The results also addressed the presence of the Pareto front, where it is not possible to improve the selected KPIs without negatively affecting others.

Cloud computing has proven to be an incredible technology for provisioning quickly deployed and scalable information technology (IT) solutions at reduced infrastructure costs. Cloud computing is unable to meet the requirements of low latency, location awareness, and mobility support. To solve this problem, researchers have introduced a trusted and dependable solution through fog and mobile edge computing (FMEC) to put the services and resources of the cloud closer to users, which facilitates the leveraging of available services and resources in the edge networks. Organizations are beginning to look at FMEC as the answer to the cloud computing problem. FMEC consists of putting micro data centers or even small, purpose-built high-performance data analytics machines in remote offices and locations in order to gain real-time insights from the data collected, or to promote data thinning at the edge, by dramatically reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to a central data center. Without having to move unnecessary data to a central data center, analytics at the edge can simplify and drastically speed analysis while also cutting costs. FMEC pushes applications, data, and computing power (services) away from centralized points to the logical extremes of a network. FMEC replicates fragments of information across distributed networks of web servers, which may be vast.

Therefore, the intent of individuals should be identified and the device movement should adhere to it. Skeletal muscles contract synergistically to produce defined lower limb movements, so unique contraction patterns in lower extremity musculature may provide a means of device joint control. Ultrasound (US) imaging enables direct measurement of the local deformation of muscle segments. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower limb movements. Methods: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate US features of the rectus femoris muscle during a non-weight-bearing knee flexion/extension experiment by nine able-bodied subjects. Five US features of the skeletal muscle tissue were studied, namely thickness, angle between aponeuroses, pennation angle, fascicle length, and echogenicity. A multiscale ridge filter was utilized to extract the structures in the image and a random sample consensus (RANSAC) model was used to segment muscle aponeuroses and fascicles. A localization scheme further guided RANSAC to enable tracking in a US image sequence. Gaussian process regression models were trained using segmented features to estimate both knee joint angle and angular velocity. Results: The proposed segmentation-estimation approach could estimate knee joint angle and angular velocity with an average root mean square error value of 7.45° and 0.262 rad/s, respectively. The average processing rate was 3-6 frames/s that is promising toward real-time implementation. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower extremity motion. The ability of the algorithm to work in real time may enable the use of US as a neural interface for lower limb applications.

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility.

This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability.

Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain.

These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment. In this paper we propose a Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System based on the speed of vehicles, for effective lane changing in the dynamic mobility model.

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models.

Since the random delay of packet or cell switched networks makes synchronization among media more complicated after the transmission across the network, a model which considers the random transmission delay is hence required to specify the temporal relationship among media. Therefore, a real-time synchronization model is presented to satisfy this requirement in the paper. Based on the proposed synchronization model, a transport protocol, namely the multimedia synchronization transport protocol (MSTP), is designed and implemented.

Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as a key technology for next-generation networks because it contains advanced functions such as centralized control, software-based traffic analysis, and forwarding rules for dynamic updates. In this paper, an SDN with flexible architecture is considered and a transport component is proposed. The component based on mesh topology is an example of joint route prediction and forwarding. First, different from existing transport protocols, the component can adopt a software-defined stream access control strategy that includes an extended forwarding mechanism (retransmission) to improve the short-term response performance. Second, we evaluate the impact of route prediction on transport network performance by using offline training and prediction. The key challenge here is that a suitable model needs to be trained from a limited training sample dataset, which will dynamically update the forwarding rules based on current and historical facts (network data). By introducing a parallel neural network classifier, an intelligent route arrangement is implemented in this work.

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the “last mile” scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene. Note to Practitioners-This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene, and it is also applicable to other scenes, including commuting scenes, urban transportation hub scenes, and destination scenes of the tourist market. Shared bus operation routes at such scenes are usually aimed at trips with fixed destinations. Existing approaches to planning routes are generally designed for traditional transportation, such as traditional buses and taxis. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic route planning approach (SubBus) based on the operation characteristics of shared subway shuttle buses. We perform a resident travel behavior analysis to improve the accuracy of travel requirement prediction. After that, we combine the prediction results and station properties to gain shared bus optimal routes. We then display how to apply SubBus to optimize shared bus operation status based on crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data generated by Panda Bus Company. We keep a continuous collaboration with the company to optimize the approach details and experimental effects, which demonstrate that our approach can generate effective routes for shared subway shuttle buses to optimize operation status on the “last mile” issue.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457286/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

Unlike a few other architectures, SSD Mobilenet requires very limited computation, hence enabling swift detection. Furthermore, an acoustic signal (sound) processing (pitch detection) algorithm is employed to detect the sirens of emergency vehicles to nullify the potential false positives (e.g. an ambulance in a non-emergency scenario) that creep into object detection using image processing. Both algorithms work in unison, bolstering the accuracy of detection.

How to improve the ability of fuel consumption estimation and abnormality detection of fuel system becomes an important topic of airlines. To enhance the ability of fuel consumption estimation and abnormality detection, this paper analyzes the flight data of fuel system and establishes a model of fuel consumption estimation and abnormality detection, which can upgrade the precision of flight plan's fuel estimation and abnormality detection of fuel system to reduce the fuel consumption cost and find faults or faults once them occur in the fuel system. The fuel estimation and abnormality detection model is closely related to airplane performance, engine performance, flight track and meteorology. Most traditional fuel consumption models are based on energy balance principle, which need to inquire performance graphs. However, it is difficult to obtain the performance data from performance graphs. To deal with this problem, this paper builds an airplane fuel estimation model by training a BP neural network based on the airplane flight data. What's more, using the abnormal data when faults or faults occur in the fuel system, the model can detect the abnormal condition of fuel system and warn the pilots. Because it is not enough accurate to estimate fuel consumption of the entire flight course once, based on flight data, the flight course is divided automatically into five routes by the model in this paper, which is takeoff, climb, cruise and decline. Models of different routes are trained in different BP neural networks to estimate the fuel consumption of each route. Adding all the fuel consumption of different routes, the fuel consumption of entire flight course will be calculated. Considering the factors of meteorology, the speed and acceleration of airplane, including (but not limited to), wind direction, wind speed, tilt, longitudinal acceleration and transverse acceleration, and so on, are taken as inputs when the model is established. These factors make the fuel consumption estimation much closer to the real flight fuel consumption data and abnormal condition be easily detected.

Q-learning is used for predicting the most efficient path by learning from its own experiences of rewards and penalties and so we don’t need to train the model which therefore increases the efficiency. This work can be implemented at a place where industrial waste is generated and can be very helpful in managing the same. This could be implemented as a service and handed over to the probable customers or government organizations which provide waste management services to the industries. This submission is a step towards automation of the Industrial Waste Management and helps in planning of waste management in real-time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555893/,2019 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Remote Sensing (ICICRS),19-20 July 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441582,A Real-Time Deep Transfer Learning Model for Facial Mask Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rise of COVID-19, wearing masks in public areas has become paramount to preventing the transmission of the coronavirus, Furthermore, many public service providers may require customers to properly wear masks in order to be served. But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people's faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials.As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4]. Masks have since been required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, transportation hubs such as airports and stations [5].However, Machine Learning and Deep Learning can help to combat Covid-19 in many ways. Enabling researchers and clinicians to evaluate a vast amount of data to make various predictions. In particular, face mask detection may prove to be useful as a guide for government surveillance on people in public areas susceptible to transmission, to ensure that face mask regulations are upheld. To achieve this, deep learning binary classification facial mask model based on VGG19 and one-shot object detection methods will be trained.We contribute a dual face-and-mask detection system that can provide immediate feedback in live surveillance systems. The method introduced is fast and accurate and can work for live mask-checking in busy public areas, alleviating some of the human effort and error typically subject to the mask mandating task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9441582/,2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS),19-23 April 2021,ieeexplore

The fluctuating market necessities, the distribution of production facilities, the influence of the emerging economies and the environmental compromise force transport logistics services to be as dynamic as possible, answering to real-time events while improving their reliability, efficiency and accuracy. But the transport logistics chain is made up of actors using their own information systems (IS) for the daily management. Although several standards from the logistics world are used for message exchange, there is still a need of agreement on using the same language while preserving the internal way of operation at each company. The solution to this need opens a new horizon in providing access to information in a common language (taking advantage of existing standards). This common language would allow deploying real-time cooperative planning algorithms to find the best route attending to criteria such as the most green, quick, economic and/or safe route as well as algorithms able to react to real-time events (e.g. delays, accidents, breakdowns). In this paper, it is explained how a common language, the Common Framework for ICT (CF) in transport and logistics, was developed; how this language is implemented by ontology means and the development of ontology-based ICT tools. Tools allowing the creation of an environment where transport logistics chain's actors remain using their own IS while they are real-time situational-aware; and,additionally, proving a low entry-cost interoperability solution thanks to the avoidance of a costly shared and centralized ICT infrastructure usage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7136595/,2015 4th International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT),20-22 May 2015,ieeexplore

In such a system, the essential requirement is collecting and processing big data which will raise two critical issues, energy-conservation and scalability. To address the former issue, the GPS sleeping interval of a smart-phone is controlled by the back-end servers adaptively based on the real-time moving speed and transportation modes. To address the latter issue, we consider MapReduce to design the back-end Cloud, where intelligent learning and classification algorithms are implemented to detect the stops and transportation modes and provide smartphones with an appropriate GPS sleeping interval based on the GPS statistics on the back-end Cloud. The unique feature of our system is to integrate participatory sensing and Cloud-enabled processing system closely which incorporates knowledge extracted from the Cloud (i.e., transportation modes) into sensing control of smartphones. In this way, sensing control could be optimized through the knowledge behind crowdsourced data.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors.

The software system maps current processes to agents as system components and improves the efficiency by intelligent objects. To handle the high complexity and dynamics of logistics autonomous intelligent agents plan and control the way of represented objects through the logistic network by themselves and induce a flexible and reactive system behavior.

This can be achieved through seamless integration along existing networking devices and systems, while taking account the data-driven nature and security constraints imposed upon such low power, efficient embedded networked platforms. We argue that only through a combined security and communication approach can the relevant goals be achieved, by considering security issues as an integral part of high level layers of the protocol stack. This paper presents an analysis of security and communication constraints of IPv6-based wireless sensor networks at the network and transport layer. Leveraging the Contiki operating system for resource constrained devices along with the ContikiSec security layer and RPL, IPv6 Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, helpful insight is achieved for evaluation and deployment.

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. We then evaluate each class of algorithms in terms of accuracy, sample complexity, and model explainability. Our experiments reveal that, in terms of these three requirements, the gradient boosting and neural network algorithms for SLA decomposition out-perform random forest algorithms, given emulated data sets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9165317/,2020 6th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft),29 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

Unlike the ubiquitous von Neumann computer architectures with complex processor cores and sequential computation, biological neurons and synapses operate by storing and processing information simultaneously with the capacity of flexible adaptation resulting in massive computational capability with much less power consumption. The search for a synaptic material which can closely imitate bio-synapse has led to an alamethicin-doped, synthetic biomembrane which can emulate key synaptic functions due to generic memristive property enabling learning and computation. This two-terminal, biomolecular memristor, in contrast to its solid-state counterparts, features similar structure, switching mechanism, and ionic transport modality as biological synapses while consuming considerably lower power. In this paper, we outline a methodology for using this biomolecular synapse to build neural networks capable of solving real-world problems. The physical mechanism underlying its volatile memristance is explored followed by the development of a model of this device for circuit simulation. We outline a circuit design technique to integrate this synapse with solid-state neuron circuit for hardware implementation. Based on these results, we develop a high level simulation framework and use a training scheme called Evolutionary Optimization for Neuromorphic System (EONS) to generate networks for solving two problems, namely iris dataset classification and EEG classification task.

For these applications, the decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) [1]. The experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip [2].

Dense packing of containers can significantly decrease supply chain costs, since transport fees are related to the the number of used containers and not the content. This practical problem is generally modeled using the vector bin packing problem (VBPP) and its variations. In the recent years, the heterogeneous VBPP with two sets of constraints has proven to be a good representation of container packing related problems. In this work we extend this model to a more realistic setting, by allowing multiple containers of the same type. To solve this problem, an integer program is designed. To be able to find feasible solutions for large scale problem instances, a greedy constructive algorithm is developed. With the intention of improving the solutions generated in this way, a local search is developed and used to extend the greedy algorithm to the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic. To evaluate the potential of using GRASP on this problem, several variations are designed and implemented. In our computational experiments, we have generated test instances based on real-world data. Experimental results show that the designed metaheuristic approaches provide high quality solutions compared to solutions obtained by the CPLEX solver. Further, one of the proposed GRASP variants has been adapted for the homogeneous VBPP and tested on standard benchmark instances in order to evaluate its performance against existing metaheuristic. The final conclusion is that the GRASP presents a promising approach for more challenging instances for which CPLEX cannot find feasible solution within a reasonable time limit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8632779/,2019 China-Qatar International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Applications to Intelligent Manufacturing (AIAIM),1-4 Jan. 2019,ieeexplore

Commonly deployed prediction methods such as support vector regression and neural networks achieve good performance by explicitly predicting the traffic variables (e.g., traffic speed or volume) at each road segment in the network. For large traffic networks, predicting traffic variable at each road segment may be unwieldy, especially in the setting of real-time prediction. To tackle this problem, we propose an alternative approach in this paper. We first generate low-dimensional representation of the network, leveraging on the column-based (CX) decomposition of matrices. The low-dimensional model represents the large network in terms of a small subset of road segments. The future state of the low-dimensional network is predicted by standard procedures, i.e., support vector regression. The future state of the entire network is then inferred by extrapolating the predictions of the subnetwork, using the CX decomposition.

In order to solve the VDP/CD/MD, A hierarchical multiplex structure (HIMS/sup ++/) calculation model is proposed. The HIMS/sup ++/ model take advantage of object-oriented modeling, heuristic method, and fuzzy inference in (atomic, molecular, individual) 3 layers, so it can find a utility decision (vehicles plan) close to expert dispatcher. Furthermore, since the vital input parameters are few and the computational engine is packaged into a software component, the HIMS/sup ++/ model is a convenient tool for the VDP/CD/MD. The HIMS/sup ++/ model and its optimization algorithm are implemented as a software component using object-oriented paradigm, and through meta-programming.

Advanced multi-robot systems show a rich set of complex behaviors. Thus, these systems are difficult to test manually. Moreover, the space of potential environments and tasks for such systems is enormous. Therefore, methods that are able to explore this space in a structured way are needed. One way to address these issues is through model-based testing. In this paper we present an approach for testing the navigation system of a fleet of industrial transport robots.

Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain. A thorough analysis of different terrain descriptors within the context of incremental learning is presented to select the best performing approach.

In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment.

The certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations is vital and may become the ""weak link"" in the whole network ecosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of certificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive certificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing. Although the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the cost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose DRLGENCERT, the first framework of applying deep reinforcement learning to the automated testing of certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations. DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary certificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could trigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement learning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best next action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of simple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new techniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method for X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth. Also, we implemented a prototype of DRLGENCERT and carried out a series of real-world experiments. The results show DRLGENCERT is quite efficient, and we obtained 84,661 discrepancy-triggering certificates from 181,900 certificate seeds, say around 46.5% effectiveness.

Manual programming of cooperating robots is difficult, but with large numbers of different sized and shaped cut-pieces, it is almost impossible. This paper presents an automated production system consisting of a camera for the precise detection of the position of each cut-piece and a collision-free path planner which can dynamically react to different positions for the transfer motions. The path is planned for multiple robots adhering to motion constrains, such as the requirement that the textile cut-piece must form a catenary which can change during transport. Additionally a technique based on machine learning has been implemented which correctly resolves redundancy for a linear axis during planning. Finally, all components are tested on a real robot system in industrial scale.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8256157/,2017 13th IEEE Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),20-23 Aug. 2017,ieeexplore

Our problem definition was derived from a real-life context within our campus wherein golf carts are used to transport people. Given that the complexity of the pickup and delivery problem is NP-hard, our prime strategy to address this complexity is the design a decentralized architecture to distribute decision-making over components of the system and to develop a set of heuristics to find optimal solutions without an exhaustive search. The decentralized model is implemented as a set cooperating autonomous components, each of which has computing power and decisionmaking autonomy, while contributing cooperatively to derive an optimal solution. The game simulation is used to generate descriptive data that capture pickup and delivery scenarios.

It is observed that most motorcyclists avoid wearing helmets despite it being an indispensable safety equipment, whose use can significantly reduce the risk of severe head and brain injuries during accidents. Due to violations of most of the traffic and safety rules, motorcycle accidents have been skyrocketing in the recent years. Hence, it’s the need of the hour to build an effective and scalable system capable of automatic helmet detection by analyzing the surveillance camera’s traffic videos. Although several theoretical deep learning-based models have been proposed to detect helmets for the traffic surveillance aspect, an optimal solution for the industry application is less discussed. This paper demonstrates a novel implementation of the Faster R-CNN and SSD framework for accurate helmet detection in real-time low-quality surveillance videos. The experimental results claim that there is a trade-off between accuracy and execution speed.

Such is the case with processes related to gases extraction or transport phenomena. The present research is focused on the development of a control algorithm (automatic control strategy), based on artificial neural networks, to identify an industrial process by using process historical records, as well as knowledge from the operation itself. The output of the identification stage feeds a classic PID controller to perform control actions (hybrid controller). Here, an actuator or final control element is modeled, estimating its space-state dynamic equation. With the estimated model, a local control loop is conformed controlling the main process or manipulated variable. For this, the process of gases transport in a copper smelter plant was chosen, where the necessary data and scenarios for the proposed control algorithm testing was obtained.

Discovering the hidden causal relationships among urban operational factors is a key research issue in city planning. Traditional approaches that concentrate on one aspect (e.g. transport) may have limitation when the city planning needs holistic analysis and an interoperable view of the city system. We introduce a systematic factor analysis approach for urban information by using Bayesian Network (BN) framework. We build a BN structure to present the causal relationships among city information factors based on integrated data sets. In addition, our approach is a dynamic modeling method because the learned BN structure will change in different time periods depends on the different service that the city provides. With structural leaning and real time monitoring, we perform Bayesian inference on the BN structure and the transformation of BN structure.

Using public transport, although is cheaper and efficient, entails that only fixed places of boarding/exiting may be used which, in turn, implies walking to (from) a particular location from (to) a given station. Given the impact of the weather on the mood and activities, preferences for a certain type of services may need to be dynamically adjusted based on the current weather or the near-future forecast, modulo travel-routes to preferred locations. In this work, we develop a model to predict a user's preferred mode of transport (car, or public transit) from their old check-ins and incorporate the weather context into the recommendation process.

This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9148208/,2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC),15-19 June 2020,ieeexplore

Integration of IEEE 1451 services based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) enables simple implementation, interoperability, scalability of distributed system components, accessible in the form of network services. Addressing the transport latency and packet loss in distributed systems, we propose the concept of algorithms' and processes' implementation in the form of dislocated network services. Introducing the signal data paths, time-stamped data and time synchronization mechanism, we provide the support for real-time system characteristics. Each component on the data path is able to analyze the packets of time-stamped information, extract an adequate sample set, and apply this set to the input of the implemented real-time algorithm or actuator. Proper management of the time-stamped information along data path enables real-time actions despite the network propagation delay or other systems' latencies. In this paper, the presented architecture is used for integration of the signal prediction service in smart transducers network based on SOA. Purpose of the service is to predict the values of arbitrary signals in order to compensate network delay and packet loss.

Data collection and implementation of such systems is often costly, and few countries have support for such systems in their transportation budgets. In places where maintaining currency and accuracy of information is difficult, many problems arise. For instance, in Chennai, India, real time bus transit data is not maintained, there is no proper communication about the bus schedules, bus stops are not regularly updated and inconsistent information about bus stops is observed in the transport authority's website. We are interested in developing models for identifying bus stops from trajectories for situations where accurate and current information is not available and traffic conditions are challenging, such as Chennai, India. We develop a simple yet easily accessible Android mobile application (App) to collect GPS traces of bus routes. We use our App to collect GPS trajectory data from Baltimore, Maryland, a place where there are facilities to access up-to-date information about bus stops. We also collect GPS trajectories from Chennai, India. We then develop a model using machine learning techniques to identify bus stops from the collected trajectories. We experimentally evaluate our model by training it on the Baltimore dataset and testing it on the Chennai dataset, achieving testing accuracy between 85 -- 90%. This is comparable to the accuracy of 95% achieved by both training and testing on the Chennai dataset.

Many intelligent decisions can benefit from the discovery of the most central nodes, including the planning of airline hub, transport hub and regional logistics hub.

These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role.

How is this possible? And how can we replicate this? A crucial clue comes from neuroscience: the brain is a complex physical system and the network topology of its neural circuitry is a determinant of its emergent collective properties. Indeed, as the brain's neural network is already entrained in its physical hardware, it clearly does not require an ANN software add-on to learn from natural data. Self-assembled nanowire networks with memristive junctions represent arguably the closest hardware architecture to real biological neural networks and are thus uniquely placed to demonstrate genuinely neuromorphic information processing. Here, we present preliminary results on polymer-coated silver nanowire networks.

The potential for associative learning is demonstrated in a test protocol in which a nanowire network is stimulated by multiple electrodes mapped to different spatial patterns. The capacity to process information in the temporal domain is demonstrated via simulations of a reservoir computing implementation in which nanowire networks are shown to perform tasks such as time series prediction and handwritten digit recognition.

Of particular importance for monitoring system users is that the use of the system should be as easy as possible with regard to storing, observing and interpreting the monitoring data. These features are enabled by introducing ontologies into the operation of the monitoring system. In addition to the conventional monitoring activities, using ontologies makes it possible to automate the process of reasoning on performance flaws and to easily change the focus of monitoring. In the paper we will focus on the concept and some implementation details of our monitoring system, assuming that an infrastructure to support the transport and storage of performance data on the usage of resources in MUSCLE-based applications should be transparent and lightweight.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6130739/,2011 IEEE Seventh International Conference on e-Science Workshops,5-8 Dec. 2011,ieeexplore

For their successful deployment, the content providers are increasingly becoming interested in evaluating the performance of such traffic from the final users' perspective, that is, their Quality of Experience (QoE). For this purpose, subjective quality assessment methods are costly and can not be used in real time. Therefore, automatic estimation of QoE is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a no-reference QoE monitoring module for adaptive HTTP streaming using TCP and the H.264 video codec. HTTP streaming using TCP is the popular choice of many web based and IPTV applications due to the intrinsic advantages of the protocol. Moreover, these applications do not suffer from video data loss due to the reliable nature of the transport layer. However, there can be playout interruptions and if adaptive bitrate video streaming is used then the quality of video can vary due to lossy compression.

Even though traffic flow information is better than no traffic information, drivers still face dangerous congested traffic flow. Several approaches have addressed short-term traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed agents and for managing traffic congestion. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles handle their own positions. Our foresight-route-providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations. In our simulations, we demonstrate that our assignment route strategies have the potential for significant efficiency and stability for traffic flow in decentralized processing environments that can collect dynamic traffic conditions from the previous few minutes and estimate the vehicle positions after a few minutes in only limited links. In this paper, we evaluate the differences between centralized and decentralized processing environments and investigate how the ratio of probe vehicles that are equipped with such devices as navigation systems is related to efficient and stable traffic flow.

The presented method uses a deep neural network to teach cars to steer themselves without any additional software. We created a labeled dataset for the ACTor (Autonomous Campus TranspORt) electric vehicle by pairing real world images taken during a drive with the associated steering wheel angle. We trained a model end to end using modern deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to automatically detect relevant features in the input and provide a predicted output. This means that no traditional hand engineered algorithm features were required for this implementation. We currently use an pretrained inception network on the ImageNet dataset to leverage the high level features learned from ImageNet to the steering problem through transfer learning. We removed the top portion of the network and replaced it with a linear regression node to provide the output. The model is trained end to end using backpropagation. The trained model is integrated with vehicle software on ROS (Robot Operating System) to read image data and provide a corresponding steering angle in real time.

People want to plan their city commutes and do not like waiting for long hours, nor take a long route to reach their destination. The proposed hardware solution in this paper computes the shortest path to reach the destination in real time and gives that information to the bus driver. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is used to give an accurate estimate of the arrival time (ETA) to the commuter by means of an application. ETA to the next stop is communicated to the commuter using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, by the hardware mounted on the bus. The proposed solution also adds a fleet management console to the administrators, making them manage and monitor the fleet of buses in real time.

To release humans from the repetitive and laborious job, we develop an autonomous trolley deployment robot to detect, transport and collect the scattered idle trolleys to recycling points. This paper will firstly illustrate the entire collection pipeline of the deployment robot system and then address the key challenge: partial to full point set registration. With the perception framework, the robot can detect the idle trolleys and acquire the pose of the trolleys on the ground, and then capture the trolley from behind, along the same direction for subsequent grasping and manipulation. With RGB-D camera and a segmentation Convolutional Neural Network, the robot can generate a partial surface point cloud of the detected trolley. The resulting point cloud, data and a pre-scanned full trolley point cloud, model, are matched by an implicit pose. To tackle the low accuracy and long computation time issues, a novel searching space-constrained point set registration algorithm is proposed to register the two overlapping point sets. Based on Branch-and-Bound (BnB) mechanism, the error between data and model is iteratively optimized. The constraint of searching space speeds up the global searching of the optimal pose, by pruning the candidate spaces which is impossible to contain the optimal result. To evaluate the performance, an airport trolley segmentation dataset and a point cloud dataset for registration are constructed. Experimental results on the datasets and synthetic dataset show that our method achieves higher accuracy and success rate than the previous methods.

To address the increasing energy consumption and throughput requirements of HPC, scientific computing and AI applications, libraries and hardware implementations now provide new floating-point formats, allowing mathematical function evaluations with different performance and accuracy trade-offs. In this article we present a methodology and its associated proof-of-concept tool to evaluate the benefits of custom accuracy of mathematical library calls in HPC and scientific computations. First, our tool collects for each call-site of a mathematical function the input- and output-data profile. Then, using a heuristic exploration algorithm, we estimate the minimal required accuracy by rounding the result to lower precisions. The data profile and accuracy measurement per call-site is used to speculatively select the mathematical function implementation with the most appropriate accuracy for a given scenario.

Since the random delay of packet or cell switched networks makes synchronization among media more complicated after the transmission across the network, a model which considers the random transmission delay is hence required to specify the temporal relationship among media. Therefore, a real-time synchronization model is presented to satisfy this requirement in the paper.

10.1109/49.310965,A novel neural network traffic enforcement mechanism for ATM networks,IEEE,Journals,"ATM has been recommended by the CCITT as the transport vehicle for the future B-ISDN networks. In ATM-based networks, a set of user declared parameters that describes the traffic characteristics, is required for the connection acceptance control (CAC) and traffic enforcement (policing) mechanisms. At the call set-up phase, the CAC algorithm uses those parameters to make a call acceptance decision. During the call progress, the policing mechanism uses the same parameters to control the user's traffic within its declared values in order to protect the network's resources and avoid possible congestion problems. A novel policing mechanism using neural networks (NNs) is presented. This is based upon an accurate estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of the traffic via its count process and implemented using NNs. The pdf-based policing is made possible only by NNs because pdf policing requires complex calculations, in real-time, at very high speeds. The architecture of the policing mechanism is composed of two interconnected NNs. The first one is trained to learn the pdf of ""ideal nonviolating"" traffic, whereas the second is trained to capture the ""actual"" characteristics of the ""actual"" offered traffic during the progress of the call. The output of both NNs is compared. Consequently, an error signal is generated whenever the pdf of the offered traffic violates its ""ideal"" one. The error signal is then used to shape the traffic back to its original values.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/310965/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,Aug. 1994,ieeexplore

Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved.

Data collected from these sensors is used to achieve energy efficiency, for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate six different machine learning algorithms for human activity detection task, on a data set collected in our laboratory. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up to 99.95% classification accuracy. We also implemented energy-efficiency measures, leading to up to 30% energy efficiency improvement on top of our initial design. This ambient environment, along with data analytics and improved energy efficiency, provides information regarding the occupancy and behavior of people within its range. Spaces such as conference rooms, common areas such as libraries, classrooms, and even public spaces such as public transport can benefit from our design. Our system avoids privacy issues by using no audio/visual devices. This system thus provides an insight into smart spaces, their current trends, and what future direction research such as ours would lead them to.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8357433/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Dec. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026540,Challenges on the Way of Implementing TCP Over 5G Networks,IEEE,Journals,"5G cellular communication, especially with its hugely available bandwidth provided by millimeter-wave, is a promising technology to fulfill the coming high demand for vast data rates. These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks. It provides the analysis of the effects of TCP in 5G mmWave networks, the discussion of TCP mechanisms and parameters involved in the performance over 5G networks, and a survey of current challenges, solutions, and proposals. Finally, a feasibility analysis proposal of machine learning-based approaches to improve reliable end-to-end communications in 5G networks is presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9205403/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944675,Hybrid Chain-Hypergraph P Systems for Multiobjective Ensemble Clustering,IEEE,Journals,"Clustering is a classic combined optimization problem that is widely used in pattern recognition, image processing, market analysis and so on. However, the efficiency of clustering algorithms decreases as the amount of data increases. In addition, most of the existing methods optimize only one objective and therefore may be suitable only for datasets with certain features. To address these limitations, in this paper, we develop a new hybrid chain-hypergraph P system (named HCHPS), which makes full use of the parallelism of P systems as well as the advantages of chain and hypergraph topology structures for accurate and efficient clustering. Our new P system comprises three types of subsystems, i.e., reaction chain membrane subsystems, local communication membrane subsystems and global ensemble membrane subsystems. Each type of subsystems is implemented end-to-end in HCHPS with new rules and membrane structures in parallel. In particular, to obtain efficient clustering center objects and make the algorithm robust to data with various features, the reaction chain membrane subsystems perform three different multiobjective strategies simultaneously by new chain evolution rules. To increase the population diversity of cluster centers, the local communication membrane subsystems utilize transport rules between membranes for coevolution of nondominated objects. The global ensemble membrane subsystems conduct a new dense representation multisize ensemble strategy to further improve the accuracy of the final results. Evaluations on two artificial data sets and 17 real-life data sets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in correctly clustering data sets with different dimensions and shapes. Our experimental results outperform those of both baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, benefiting from the parallelism, HCHPS is less time consuming than other methods, featuring an average completion time of 28.07 seconds on the 17 real-life data sets. Moreover, an ablation study shows that our proposed components are critical for effective cluster analysis.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8853276/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/TVT.2020.2984038,Improving the Congestion Control Performance for Mobile Networks in High-Speed Railway via Deep Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Due to the poor Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance in high-speed mobile scenarios, passengers have bad network experiences on High-Speed Railway (HSR). As a result, improving network performance for HSR scenarios has become urgent and widespread concerns. Some previous works quantitatively analyzed the TCP performance on HSR and proposed relevant solutions. Other works focused on the handover problem (the leading cause of poor network performance on HSR), and proposed a series of handover algorithms for HSR scenarios. However, the existing works are either limited to only measurement studies without algorithm implementation or lack of integration with real-world scenarios. In this paper, with a large amount of field measurement data in real HSR networks, we study the main reasons why traditional TCP performs poorly in HSR scenarios. To improve the TCP performance, we propose Hd-TCP, a customized Congestion Control (CC) algorithm designed to deal with frequent handover on HSR from the transport layer perspective. For the transmission characteristic on HSR, Hd-TCP can accurately evaluate the link condition and apply a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make a fine control.

Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as a key technology for next-generation networks because it contains advanced functions such as centralized control, software-based traffic analysis, and forwarding rules for dynamic updates. In this paper, an SDN with flexible architecture is considered and a transport component is proposed. The component based on mesh topology is an example of joint route prediction and forwarding. First, different from existing transport protocols, the component can adopt a software-defined stream access control strategy that includes an extended forwarding mechanism (retransmission) to improve the short-term response performance. Second, we evaluate the impact of route prediction on transport network performance by using offline training and prediction. The key challenge here is that a suitable model needs to be trained from a limited training sample dataset, which will dynamically update the forwarding rules based on current and historical facts (network data). By introducing a parallel neural network classifier, an intelligent route arrangement is implemented in this work. Experimental results over different traffic patterns verify the advantages of the design.

In terms of emergency issues like catastrophic natural disasters or serious accidents, safe and timely transportation for medical vehicles is particularly important. For assistance to medical vehicles on the road, models with position prediction can provide accurate position information of ambient vehicles in the next seconds. However, with the increasing number of vehicles on the road and the changing road environment, it is an important challenge to predict the location of vehicles in the road correctly. Current location prediction models for vehicles usually use the previous trajectory of vehicles, lacking the consideration of vehicle's state and real-time traffic information, which leads to relatively low accuracy and safety. Based on the deep belief nets (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), this paper presents a location prediction model for assistance to medical vehicles (LPMVs), which fully considers vehicle's attributes, road information and driving environment as well as the relationship between the factors that influence vehicle driving behaviors and vehicle positions.

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

Such a system fits naturally with the development of an external vision system proposed by NASA for use in high-speed civil transport aircraft with limited cockpit visibility. The detection techniques should provide high detection probability for obstacles that can vary from subpixels to a few pixels in size, while maintaining a low false alarm probability in the presence of noise and severe background clutter. Furthermore, the detection algorithms must be able to report such obstacles in a timely fashion, imposing severe constraints on their execution time. For this purpose, we have implemented a number of algorithms to detect airborne obstacles using image sequences obtained from a camera mounted on an aircraft. This paper describes the methodology used for characterizing the performance of the dynamic programming obstacle detection algorithm and its special cases. The experimental results were obtained using several types of image sequences, with simulated and real backgrounds.

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

The real-time monitoring and data recording function of vehicle-mounted equipment provides data support for vehicle status assessment and fault warning. In this paper, the real-time data collected by CAN-BUS system of Beijing Bus Group are preprocessed and discretized. On the basis of the traditional rough set theory, a new coding method is set up, and the dependency between conditional attributes and decision attributes is set as an adaptive function, which is reduced by genetic algorithm and cellular genetic algorithm respectively. The calculation results show that the key fault information of public transport vehicles is instrumental speed, oil pressure, percentage of torque, timing engine speed, and coolant temperature. By comparing the results of reduction, it is found that the cellular genetic algorithm has higher applicability than the genetic algorithm in terms of algorithm efficiency, stability, and convergence quality. Although the genetic algorithm attribute reduction is slightly better than the cellular genetic algorithm attribute reduction in the rule matching, the cellular genetic algorithm has a better ability to excavate information within the acceptable compatibility range. Finally, the selected key factors will be deployed on the Beijing Bus Group's big data platform and displayed in real time.

Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking.

Finding the Pareto-optimal set of paths ideal for all requiring features is time-consuming and unclear to obtain the subset of optimal paths efficiently for multiple origin states in the planning space. Meanwhile, due to the rise of deep learning, hybrid systems of computational intelligence thrive in recent years. When facing non-monotonic data or heuristics derived from pre-trained neural networks, most of the existing methods for the one-to-all path problem fail to find an ideal solution.

But this task is very difficult and challenging due to the dynamic condition of roads. Many solutions have been given by the researchers to overcome these challenges. Some of them are giving good performance but computationally highly expensive and fail in some circumstances. In the proposed method, a feature based cost effective detection and classification method is proposed that is suitable for real time applications, provide satisfactory accuracy and computationally cheap. The proposed method uses haar-like features of the images and AdaBoost classifier for detection which provides a very fast detection rate with high accuracy. To reduce inconsiderable false positive rate generated by this method, we propose to use two virtual detection lines (VDL) that reduces the false positive rate. In order to predict the class of a vehicle, a feature based method is proposed. HOG, SIFT, SURF all are well represented feature for image classification. The existing feature based vehicle classification methods lack accuracy because of using those features inefficiently. In order to reduce those lacking, we propose to use bag of visual words (BOVW) model for classification. BOVW model also needs a lower computation time and resources. As the proposed method aims to be implemented in real time, we propose to use SURF feature for BOVW which is faster to compute and well described for recognizing an object. The BOVW then used for identifying the vehicle's class by multi class SVM classifier. Error correcting output code (ECOC) framework is used to achieve multi class prediction with SVM. Extensive experiments have been carried out on different traffic data of varying environments to evaluate the detection and classification performance of the proposed method.

These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment.

While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these are most needed remains a challenge. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are typically harder to monitor. Current practice often requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is often time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. As a result, target locations are often selected reactively, after serious traffic incidents reveal an underlying safety issue. We propose an approach to use data collected by existing traffic monitoring cameras to automatically identify pedestrian activities on the road. We propose an algorithm to detect pedestrian crossing events based on the detection of individuals on individual video frames using a deep neural network model. Resulting pedestrian locations and movement trajectories can be visualized on a background image, which is automatically extracted at the analyzed location from the video. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with a real-world use case. The case study considered in this work uses cameras owned by the City of Austin, Texas to study pedestrian road use before and after the deployment of a pedestrian-hybrid beacon. We explore qualitative and quantitative metrics to describe pedestrian activity and corresponding changes, which may be used to prioritize the deployment of pedestrian safety solutions, or evaluate their performance. We compared the number of crossing events detected per hour with manually reviewed results from a selected day. The result shows 67 percent overall accuracy, although we observe significant variability across times-of-day.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

Based on our previous research on deep learning approach for traffic data prediction, we further evaluates the performance of the SAE model for traffic flow prediction at daytime and nighttime. Through 250 experimental tasks training a SAE model and evaluating its performance at daytime and nighttime with 3 different criteria, we obtain the best combination of hyper parameters for each criterion at different times on weekday and non-weekday, respectively. Experimental results show that the MAE and RMSE at daytime are larger than that at nighttime, while the MRE at daytime are smaller than that at nighttime. For different criteria, the hyper parameters of the SAE model should vary accordingly.

Accurate modelling of a large and complex system requires large datasets to train a deep neural network that causes a challenge of scale as training the network and serving the model are computationally and memory intensive. One example of a complex system that produces a large number of spatial time-series is a large road sensor infrastructure deployed for traffic monitoring. The goal of this work is twofold: 1) To model large amount of spatial time-series from road sensors; 2) To address the scalability problem in a real-life task of large-scale road traffic prediction which is an important part of an Intelligent Transportation System.We propose a partitioning technique to tackle the scalability problem that enables parallelism in both training and prediction: 1) We represent the sensor system as a directed weighted graph based on the road structure, which reflects dependencies between sensor readings, and weighted by sensor readings and inter-sensor distances; 2) We propose an algorithm to automatically partition the graph taking into account dependencies between spatial time-series from sensors; 3) We use the generated sensor graph partitions to train a prediction model per partition. Our experimental results on traffic density prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks show that the partitioning-based models take 2x, if run sequentially, and 12x, if run in parallel, less training time, and 20x less prediction time compared to the unpartitioned model of the entire road infrastructure. The partitioning-based models take 100x less total sequential training time compared to single sensor models, i.e., one model per sensor.

To combine the spatiotemporal correlations with semantic correlations in the traffic network, this paper proposed an end-to-end framework called DeepTDP. First, we defined five kinds of spatial and semantic correlations, which are modeled into multi location graphs and fused by multi-graph convolutional network. Second, LSTM in encoder-decoder network is utilized to capture temporal correlation between future taxi demand values. Besides, a cross-entropy loss function based on error correction is designed to generate taxi demand predictions.

The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment.

However, incomplete traffic time-series data during the data analysis are nearly inevitable due to the constraints of data collection or packet loss in the communication process. Existing tensor-based completion methods fail to perform well in consecutively missing (CM) cases where a sub-series of the traffic time series is completely missing. Moreover, their high computational complexity prevents the road network-level implementation. Therefore, to tackle these problems, a batch-oriented traffic data completion method for large-scale road networks is proposed in this paper. In order to preserve multi-way natures of traffic data, we first model the traffic data by tensors so that traffic data completion becomes a tensor completion problem. Several types of tensor structures are adopted in order to analyze their impacts on traffic data completion. Thereafter, a Content-Aware traffic data completion method is further developed based on the Generative Adversarial Net (CA-GAN). More specifically, the formulated traffic tensors are interpreted as samples from a high-dimensional traffic distribution and a GAN is then proposed to learn this distribution. By considering effects of traffic data from different days and links, a weighted loss function is employed to search for the raw traffic tensor in the obtained traffic distribution. Afterwards, the estimated raw traffic tensor is used to complete the missing data. Visualization results demonstrate that our GANs can produce verisimilar traffic patterns with different time spans.
