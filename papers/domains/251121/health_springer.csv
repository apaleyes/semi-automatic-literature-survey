Faulty sensors may compromise the reliability of SHM systems, causing data corruption, data loss, and erroneous judgment of structural conditions. Fault diagnosis (FD) of SHM systems encompasses the detection, isolation, identification, and accommodation of sensor faults, aiming to ensure the reliability of SHM systems. Typically, FD is based on “analytical redundancy,” utilizing correlated sensor data inherent to the SHM system. However, most analytical redundancy FD approaches neglect the fault identification step and are tailored to specific types of sensor data. In this chapter, an analytical redundancy FD approach for SHM systems is presented, coupling methods for processing any type of sensor data and two machine learning (ML) techniques, (i) an ML regression algorithm used for fault detection, fault isolation, and fault accommodation, and (ii) an ML classification algorithm used for fault identification. The FD approach is validated using an artificial neural network as ML regression algorithm and a convolutional neural network as ML classification algorithm. Validation is performed through a real-world SHM system in operation at a railway bridge. The results demonstrate the suitability of the FD approach for ensuring reliable SHM systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-81716-9_7,springer

With the advancement of digital transformation in health technologies as cognitive computing and DL resulting in this new computational paradigm, pondering over disruptive tools giving traction to the changes transforming the way management acts and helping with medical assistance. Specifically, in the clinical area, it is more assertive diagnoses and treatments, or it can even point out the probability of a patient developing a disease, and besides, solutions based on cognitive computing have properties to suggest the treatment of diseases based on clinical protocols and best practices that have come to be effective, providing the physician with elements to deciding on what is the best care to be taken with the patient. In this context, this manuscript has the motivation and objective to develop a cognitive approach oriented towards DL, employing Python and Jupyter notebook, achieving accuracy at 84.19%, employed at a dataset of medical digital images of human blood smear fields of non-pathological leukocytes.

To achieve this goal a hybrid combination of wavelets, PCA, and cluster analysis is implemented. Damage-sensitive features from train-induced dynamic responses are extracted and allow taking advantage not only of the repeatability of the loading, but also, of its large magnitude, thus enhancing sensitivity to small-magnitude structural changes. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated in a long-span bowstring-arch railway bridge with a permanent structural monitoring system installed. A digital twin of the bridge was used, along with experimental values of temperature, noise, trains loadings, and speeds, to realistically simulate baseline and damage scenarios. The methodology proved highly sensitive in detecting early damage, even in case of small stiffness reductions that do not impair structural safety, as well as highly robust to false detections. The ability to identify early damage, imperceptible in the original signals, while avoiding observable changes induced by environmental and operational variations, is achieved by carefully defining the modelling and fusion sequence of the information. A damage detection strategy capable of characterizing multi-sensor data while being sensitive to identify local changes is proposed as a tool for real-time structural assessment of bridges without interfering with the normal service condition.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-81716-9_6,springer

TB is a contagious infection that usually presents on lungs and is identified through the initial level symptoms by conducting tests using Chest Radiographs (CXRs) and microscopic images. Powerful Diagnosis of Tuberculosis depends on rigorous analysis of radiological patterns realized in CXR. However, due to high number of patients burden and lack of resources in underdeveloped country is high chance of human error in analyzing the CXRs and hence, the diagnosis of TB becomes difficult. Our aim is to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for TB disease classification, which can help in early diagnosis of the disease. Nowadays, deep learning based automatic feature extractors are used, when large dataset is concerned for accurate classification instead of using hand crafted features. Our work deals with above mentioned methods to have a justified explanation when working with small- and large-scale data learning problems. This work proposes two approaches for classification of TB disease using X-Ray dataset. In first approach, we have utilized handcrafted features in simple neural network with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the disease as TB images and normal images. We have designed ANN system for 13 input neurons, 10 hidden neurons and 2 output neurons to train features, which are fed as input to SVM for classification purpose. Experiments are conducted on MATLAB 2014b. ANN-SVM based classification gives accuracy of 94.6% when all features are fed to it. This method is thereby awarding increase in efficiency and reduced diagnosis time. In second, we implemented Deep learning technique, which is capable of training high level features from dataset compared to handcrafted feature method to classify the TB disease. In which we have developed binary classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Google collab notebooks are used to model DCNN with GPU based Keras library and Tensor flow as back end. Experiments are conducted on Tuberculosis Chest X-ray dataset obtained from Kaggle community and showed output classification accuracy of 99.24%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76732-7_4,springer

A tumor is of two types that are malignant or benign. A brain tumor can be differentiated between primary as well as secondary.

IoT helps in making treatment hassle-free for the patient as well as provides better communication for both. A lot of IoT-based devices help in self-assessment. A better solution compared to the manual approach is that of the Machine learning-based approach in terms of quality and labor. Various Machine learning processes for detection could be used. Segmentation, and classification through deep learning seems a better approach than machine learning. Comparison of different methods of feature extraction, segmentation method, and classification method using Machine learning and then by deep learning is done separately in the tables. An optimized algorithm is really important for the best result. So here an optimized way is used which includes the use of IoT along with CWOA and ANN for a precise result. CWOA is explained which is derived from WOA along with pseudocode. Post getting the scans a sensor is used to convert images into electrical signals and store them in the server after that in Pre-processing, a median filter can be used to reduce noise. For image segmentation, Otus’s method is used for thresholding. Various features are extracted using texture, statistics and for feature selection, CWOA has been used and for classification, ANN is used with CWOA.

The technical response to this challenge falls within the framework of structural health monitoring (SHM), which pursues the automated diagnosis and prognosis of structures from continuously acquired sensor data. In the last years, particular attention has been devoted in the literature to ambient vibration-based SHM owing to its minimal intrusiveness and global damage identification capabilities. Nevertheless, the sheer variety of failure mechanisms that large-scale civil engineering structures may experience, some of which may be of local nature, compels the use of integrated SHM systems and data fusion for comprehensive damage identification. As a result, such systems must deal with extensive databases of heterogeneous monitoring data, being the selection of critical features a key step to link signals to decisions. This chapter presents an overview of some of the most recent statistical pattern recognition, data fusion, feature extraction and damage detection techniques for integrated SHM systems.

Also, several problems occur with missing sensors and abnormal conditions of equipment in various forms. In this paper, a realistic industrial problem is dealt with an anomaly detection approach based on prediction of multi-sensor data collected under normal conditions. We propose a multiple feature extraction model to discriminate at least four different anomaly types, and a prediction model based on normal state to diagnose abnormalities according to the difference between the predicted and the actual values. The proposed method uses a hierarchical model that predicts missing sensor information and predicts global sensor information. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed model improves robustness and detection accuracy. Our model generates missing sensor data with about 90% accuracy and detects anomalies with about 85% accuracy, even if part of the sensor is missing or the device has been changed.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-87869-6_57,springer

Methods We reviewed patients undergoing pyeloplasty from 2008 to 2020 at our institution, including all children and adolescents younger than 18 years. We developed a two-stage machine learning model from 34 clinical fields, which included patient characteristics, ultrasound findings, and anatomical variation. We fit and trained with a logistic lasso model for binary cure model and subsequent survival model. Feature importance on the model was determined with post-selection inference. Performance metrics included area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC), concordance, and leave-one-out cross validation. Results A total of 543 patients were identified, with a median preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior diameter of 23 and 10 mm, respectively. 39 of 232 patients included in the survival model required re-intervention. The cure and survival models performed well with a leave-one-out cross validation AUROC and concordance of 0.86 and 0.78, respectively.

But it’s hard due to the special data structure and the interpretability requirement of methods. The structure of EHR is hierarchical: each patient has a sequence of admissions, and each admission has some co-occurrence diagnoses. However, the existing methods only partially model these characteristics and lack the interpretation for non-specialists. Methods This work proposes a time-aware and co-occurrence-aware deep learning network (TCoN), which is not only suitable for EHR data structure but also interpretable: the co-occurrence-aware self-attention (CS-attention) mechanism and time-aware gated recurrent unit (T-GRU) can model multilevel relations; the interpretation path and the diagnosis graph can make the result interpretable. Results The method is tested on a real-world dataset for mortality prediction, readmission prediction, disease prediction, and next diagnoses prediction. Experimental results show that TCoN is better than baselines with 2.01% higher accuracy. Meanwhile, the method can give the interpretation of causal relationships and the diagnosis graph of each patient. Conclusions This work proposes a novel model—TCoN. It is an interpretable and effective deep learning method, that can model the hierarchical medical structure and predict medical events.

Methods This study proposes a method of data-based grouping, designed and updated by machine learning algorithms, which could be trained by real cases, or even simulated cases. It inherits the decision-making rules from the expert-oriented grouping and improves performance by incorporating continuous updates at low cost. Five typical classification algorithms were assessed and some suggestions were made for algorithm choice. The kappa coefficients were reported to evaluate the performance of grouping.

There is a need to develop reliable assessment frameworks for the clinical validation of AI. We present here an approach for assessing AI for predicting treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), using real-world data and molecular -omics data from clinical data warehouses and biobanks. Methods The European “ITFoC (Information Technology for the Future Of Cancer)” consortium designed a framework for the clinical validation of AI technologies for predicting treatment response in oncology. Results This framework is based on seven key steps specifying: (1) the intended use of AI, (2) the target population, (3) the timing of AI evaluation, (4) the datasets used for evaluation, (5) the procedures used for ensuring data safety (including data quality, privacy and security), (6) the metrics used for measuring performance, and (7) the procedures used to ensure that the AI is explainable. This framework forms the basis of a validation platform that we are building for the “ITFoC Challenge”. This community-wide competition will make it possible to assess and compare AI algorithms for predicting the response to TNBC treatments with external real-world datasets.

Desperate times have called for desperate measures to detect the disease at an early stage via various medically proven methods like chest computed tomography (CT) scan, chest X-Ray, etc., in order to prevent the virus from spreading across the community. Developing deep learning models for analysing these kinds of radiological images is a well-known methodology in the domain of computer based medical image analysis. However, doing the same by mimicking the biological models and leveraging the newly developed neuromorphic computing chips might be more economical. These chips have been shown to be more powerful and are more efficient than conventional central and graphics processing units. Additionally, these chips facilitate the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in real-world scenarios. To this end, in this work, we have tried to simulate the SNNs using various deep learning libraries. We have applied them for the classification of chest CT scan images into COVID and non-COVID classes. Our approach has achieved very high F1 score of 0.99 for the potential-based model and outperforms many state-of-the-art models.

The need for an ethical framework in AI to address this has long been recognized, but to date most efforts have delivered only high-level principles and value statements. Herein, we explain the need for an ethical framework in healthcare AI, the different moral theories that may serve as its basis, the rationale for why we believe this should be built around virtue ethics, and explore this in the context of five key ethical concerns for the introduction of AI in healthcare. Some existing work has suggested that AI may replace clinicians. We argue to the contrary, that the clinician will not be replaced, nor their role attenuated. Rather, they will be integral to the responsible design, deployment, and regulation of AI in healthcare, acting as the moral exemplar for the virtuous machine. We collate relevant points from the literature and formulate our own to present a coherent argument for the central role of clinicians in ethical AI and propose ideas to help advance efforts to employ ML-based solutions within healthcare. Finally, we highlight the responsibility of not only clinicians, but also data scientists, tech companies, ethicists, and regulators to act virtuously in realising the vision of ethical and accountable AI in healthcare.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s43681-021-00089-6,springer

This work aims to contribute to the PD diagnosis process by using a convolutional neural network, a type of deep neural network architecture, to differentiate between healthy controls and PD patients. Our approach focuses on discovering deviations in patient’s movements with the use of drawing tasks. In addition, this work explores which of two drawing tasks, wire cube or spiral pentagon, are more effective in the discrimination process. With $$93.5\%$$ 93.5 % accuracy, our convolutional classifier, trained with images of the pentagon drawing task and augmentation techniques, can be used as an objective method to discriminate PD from healthy controls.

To date, multiple eNoses have been developed and evaluated in clinical studies across a wide spectrum of lung diseases, mainly for diagnostic purposes. Heterogeneity in study design, analysis techniques, and differences between eNose devices currently hamper generalization and comparison of study results. Moreover, many pilot studies have been performed, while validation and implementation studies are scarce. These studies are needed before implementation in clinical practice can be realised.

Conventional practice involves neurosurgeon’s visual evaluation and intraoperative histological examination of dissected tissues using frozen section, which is time-consuming and complex. The aim of this study was to develop fluorescent imaging coupled with artificial intelligence technique to quickly and accurately determine glioma in real-time during surgery. Methods Glioma patients ( N  = 23) were enrolled and injected with indocyanine green for fluorescence image–guided surgery. Tissue samples ( N  = 1874) were harvested from surgery of these patients, and the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) fluorescence images were obtained. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with NIR-II fluorescence imaging (named as FL-CNN) were explored to automatically provide pathological diagnosis of glioma in situ in real-time during patient surgery. The pathological examination results were used as the gold standard. Results The developed FL-CNN achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945. Comparing to neurosurgeons’ judgment, with the same level of specificity >80%, FL-CNN achieved a much higher sensitivity (93.8% versus 82.0%, P  < 0.001) with zero time overhead. Further experiments demonstrated that FL-CNN corrected >70% of the errors made by neurosurgeons. FL-CNN was also able to rapidly predict grade and Ki-67 level (AUC 0.810 and 0.625) of tumor specimens intraoperatively. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that deep CNNs are better at capturing important information from fluorescence images than surgeons’ evaluation during patient surgery. FL-CNN is highly promising to provide pathological diagnosis intraoperatively and assist neurosurgeons to obtain maximum resection safely. Trial registration ChiCTR ChiCTR2000029402.

Health telemonitoring is an innovative solution allowing wellbeing and increasing autonomy of patients. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are a viable method used in recent studies for analyzing, predicting, and classifying health data while improving the health conditions of telemonitoring and telediagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely. The first layer of the proposed architecture performs BP measurement, classification, and transmission to the second layer using a wearable sensor. The learning of classifiers is established with Cross-Validation to avoid over-fitting and to improve the performance while comparing the Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier. An experimental trial is carried out and the timing of 49 seconds is reached between BP measurement and the display of data on the IoT platform. Besides, the system was tested in real-time trials and produced an accurate classification of each measured BP. The obtained results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of BP measurement, analysis, transmission, and supervision in real-time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12652-020-02660-1,springer

Due to the rising demands of IoT, a massive quantity of sensing data gets generated from diverse sensing devices. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are vital for providing a scalable and precise analysis of data in real time. But the design and development of a useful big data analysis technique face a few challenges, like centralized architecture, security, and privacy, resource constraints, and the lack of adequate training data. On the other hand, the rising blockchain technology offers a decentralized architecture. It enables secure sharing of data and resources to the different nodes of the IoT network and is promoted for removing centralized control and resolving the problems of AI. This study develops an optimal deep-learning-based secure blockchain (ODLSB) enabled intelligent IoT and healthcare diagnosis model. The proposed model involves three major processes: secure transaction, hash value encryption, and medical diagnosis. The ODLSB technique comprises the orthogonal particle swarm optimization (OPSO) algorithm for the secret sharing of medical images. In addition, the hash value encryption process takes place using neighborhood indexing sequence (NIS) algorithm. At last, the optimal deep neural network (ODNN) is applied as a classification model to diagnose the diseases. The utilization of OPSO algorithm for secret sharing and optimal parameter tuning process shows the novelty of the work. We carried out detailed experiments to validate the outcome of the proposed method, and several aspects of the results are considered. At the time of the diagnosis process, the OPSO-DNN model has yielded superior results, with the highest sensitivity (92.75%), specificity (91.42%), and accuracy (93.68%).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11227-021-03637-3,springer

A new type of online health estimator that uses a fuzzy brain emotional learning neural network (FBELNN) is proposed. This neural network is different to a conventional brain emotional learning neural network where the fuzzy inference system and a new reward signal are used. The effect capacity fading on the output of energy storage components is also determined. The proposed method uses a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features from the response signal for the impulse load. The DWT-PCA can reduce the workload for feature extraction. The parameter adaptation laws and convergence analysis for the FBELNN are derived and the internal parameters for the FBELNN are optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). A neural network estimates the capacity of a supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery in real-time to better ensure the safety of HESS. The sample set is collected from the voltage response signal in the HESS simulation platform and practical experimental platform.

The study consisted of two components: (1) DR screening of patients using an AI-assisted system and (2) in-depth interviews with health professionals involved in implementing screening. Participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus attending two endocrinology outpatient and three Aboriginal Medical Services clinics between March 2018 and May 2019 were invited to a prospective observational study. A single 45-degree (macula centred), non-stereoscopic, colour retinal image was taken of each eye from participants and were instantly screened for referable DR using a custom offline automated AI system. A total of 236 participants, including 174 from endocrinology and 62 from Aboriginal Medical Services clinics, provided informed consent and 203 (86.0%) were included in the analysis.

Dermatologists perform the manual inspection through visual analysis of pigmented skin lesions for melanoma identification at the early stage. However, manual inspection for melanoma detection is limited due to variable accuracy and lesser availability of dermatologists. Therefore, there exists an urgent need to develop automated melanoma detection methods that can effectively localize and classify skin lesions. Accurate localization and classification of the melanoma lesions is a challenging task due to the presence of low contrast information between the moles and skin part, the massive color similarity between the infected and non-infected skin portions, presence of noise, hairs, and tiny blood vessels, variations in color, texture, illumination, contrast, blurring, and melanoma size. To address these afore-mentioned challenges, we propose an effective and efficient melanoma detection method. The proposed method consists of three steps: i) image preprocessing, ii) employing Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) for melanoma localization, and iii) application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of localized melanoma region into benign and malignant classes. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the benchmark ISIC-2016 dataset launched by ISBI challenge-2016 that is diverse in terms of variations in illumination, color, texture, and size of melanoma, and presence of blurring, noise, hairs, and tiny blood vessels, etc. Moreover, we have also performed a cross-dataset validation over the ISIC-2017 dataset to show the efficacy of our method in real-world scenarios.

We developed Niffler, an open-source Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) framework that enables ML and processing pipelines in research clusters by efficiently retrieving images from the hospitals’ PACS and extracting the metadata from the images. We deployed Niffler at our institution (Emory Healthcare, the largest healthcare network in the state of Georgia) and retrieved data from 715 scanners spanning 12 sites, up to 350 GB/day continuously in real-time as a DICOM data stream over the past 2 years. We also used Niffler to retrieve images bulk on-demand based on user-provided filters to facilitate several research projects. This paper presents the architecture and three such use cases of Niffler. First, we executed an IVC filter detection and segmentation pipeline on abdominal radiographs in real-time, which was able to classify 989 test images with an accuracy of 96.0%. Second, we applied the Niffler Metadata Extractor to understand the operational efficiency of individual MRI systems based on calculated metrics. We benchmarked the accuracy of the calculated exam time windows by comparing Niffler against the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW). Niffler accurately identified the scanners’ examination timeframes and idling times, whereas CDW falsely depicted several exam overlaps due to human errors. Third, with metadata extracted from the images by Niffler, we identified scanners with misconfigured time and reconfigured five scanners. Our evaluations highlight how Niffler enables real-time ML and processing pipelines in a research cluster.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10278-021-00491-w,springer

However, it is tedious and error-prone for physicians to inspect the huge number of captured images. Artificial Intelligence supports computer-aided diagnostic tools to tackle this challenge. Unlike previous research focusing on the application of large deep neural network (DNN) models for processing images that have been saved on the computer, we propose a light-weight DNN model that has the potential of running locally in the WCE. Thus, only images with diseases are transmitted, saving energy on data transmission. Several aspects of the design are presented in detail, including the DNN’s architecture, the loss function, the criterion of true positive, and data augmentation. We explore design parameters of the DNN architecture in several experiments. These experiments use a training dataset of 1222 images and a test dataset with 153 images. The results of our study indicate that our designed DNN has an Average Precision of AP $$_{25} = 91.7\%$$ 25 = 91.7 % on our test dataset while the parameter storage size is only $$29.1\,\mathrm {KB}$$ 29.1 KB , which is small enough to run locally on a WCE.

Researchers have suggested hybrid solutions to resolve these problems, which have been found to be more effective than conventional methods because these systems integrate their merits while reducing their drawbacks. In the current research article, hybrid model has been presented by coupling feature optimization with prediction approach. The proposed hybrid model has two stages: the first involves implementing the ReliefF Algorithm for optimum feature selection in erythemato-squamous diseases, and the second involves implementing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) for prediction of those selected optimum features. The experimentation was carried out on bench mark dataset for erythemato-squamous diseases.

Real-time cardiovascular disease monitoring based on wearable medical devices may effectively reduce COVID-19 mortality rates. However, due to technical limitations, there are three main issues. First, the traditional wireless communication technology for wearable medical devices is difficult to satisfy the real-time requirements fully. Second, current monitoring platforms lack efficient streaming data processing mechanisms to cope with the large amount of cardiovascular data generated in real time. Third, the diagnosis of the monitoring platform is usually manual, which is challenging to ensure that enough doctors online to provide a timely, efficient, and accurate diagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 5G-enabled real-time cardiovascular monitoring system for COVID-19 patients using deep learning.

Focusing on diagnosis process and target disease, this study theoretically proposed an integrated model to optimize traditional medical expense system, and ultimately helps medical staff and patients make more reliable decisions. From the new perspective of total expense estimation and detailed expense analysis, the proposed model innovatively consists of two intelligent modules, with theoretical contribution. The two modules are SVM-based module and SOM-based module. According to the rigorous comparative analysis with two classic AI techniques, back propagation neural networks and random forests, it is demonstrated that the SVM-based module achieved better capability of total expense estimation. Meanwhile, by designing a two-stage clustering process, SOM-based module effectively generated decision clusters and corresponding cluster centers were obtained, that clarified the complex relationship between detailed expense and patient information. To achieve practical contribution, the proposed model was applied to the diagnosis process of coronary heart disease. The real data from a hospital in Shanghai was collected, and the validity and accuracy of the proposed model were verified with rigorous experiments.

The first idea from this research utilizes the discrete model from a perspective that is different from the finite element method (FEM) of previous works. As the method in this paper only models the mechanical properties of structures with finite degrees of freedom instead of dividing them into smaller elements, it reduces error in evaluation and produces more realistic results compared to the FEM model. Another advantage is how it allows the research to survey both parameters that affect the mechanical properties of structures—the overall stiffness ( K ) and the damping coefficient ( c )—during vibration, while previous researches focus only on one of these two parameters. The second idea is to use FFT analysis to increase the sensitivity of the signal received during vibration. FFT analysis simplifies calculations, thereby reducing the effect of noise or errors. The sensitivity achieved in FFT analysis increases by 25% compared to traditional Fourier Transform (FT) analysis; moreover, the error in FFT analysis compared to experimental results is quite small, less than 2%. This shows that FFT is a suitable method to identify sensitive characteristics in evaluating changes in the mechanical properties. When FFT is combined with the discrete model, results are much better than those of several existing approaches. For the last idea, the manuscript applies deep learning (FFT-deep learning) in the noise reduction process for the original data. This makes the results much more accurate than in previous studies. The results of this research are shown through the monitoring of spans of the Saigon Bridge—the biggest and most important bridge in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam—during the past 11 years. The correspondence between the theoretically obtained result and the experimental one at the Saigon Bridge suggests a new area for development in evaluating and forecasting structural changes in the future.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s42417-021-00343-5,springer

Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task (subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets.

Automatic glaucoma detection based on fundus images has been widely studied in recent years. However, existing methods mainly depend on a considerable amount of labeled data to train the model, which is a serious constraint for real-world glaucoma detection. Methods In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning technique that leverages the fundus feature learned from similar ophthalmic data to facilitate diagnosing glaucoma. Specifically, a Transfer Induced Attention Network (TIA-Net) for automatic glaucoma detection is proposed, which extracts the discriminative features that fully characterize the glaucoma-related deep patterns under limited supervision. By integrating the channel-wise attention and maximum mean discrepancy, our proposed method can achieve a smooth transition between general and specific features, thus enhancing the feature transferability. Results To delimit the boundary between general and specific features precisely, we first investigate how many layers should be transferred during training with the source dataset network. Next, we compare our proposed model to previously mentioned methods and analyze their performance. Finally, with the advantages of the model design, we provide a transparent and interpretable transferring visualization by highlighting the key specific features in each fundus image. We evaluate the effectiveness of TIA-Net on two real clinical datasets and achieve an accuracy of 85.7%/76.6%, sensitivity of 84.9%/75.3%, specificity of 86.9%/77.2%, and AUC of 0.929 and 0.835, far better than other state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion Different from previous studies applied classic CNN models to transfer features from the non-medical dataset, we leverage knowledge from the similar ophthalmic dataset and propose an attention-based deep transfer learning model for the glaucoma diagnosis task. Extensive experiments on two real clinical datasets show that our TIA-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and meanwhile, it has certain medical value and significance for the early diagnosis of other medical tasks.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12938-021-00877-5,springer

The purpose of this publication is to analyse risks and threats relating to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) considerations in the context of scientific and technological development. The article attempts the analysis of whether current legislation of the European Union enables good protection of workers’ health in the performance of their duties using robots, artificial intelligence (AI). A feature of robotisation and AI may be new challenges in OHS protection. The analysis performed aims to determine whether threats posted by working with Artificial Intelligence are serious enough for the EU Legislator to focus on implementation of new OHS regulations. Methods The analysis was carried out on the basis of current legal regulations related to the protection of employee’s health in the European Union. The study used literature related to robotisation with artificial intelligence and health and safety at work in the working environment. Results Given the new psychological and physical threats related to the use of AI robots, it is necessary to expand the EU legislation with general guidelines for the use of intelligent robots in the work environment. Indeed, such robots must be defined in the applicable legal framework. Employers should also define, as part of their internal regulations, the procedures for employee communication with artificial intelligence, and relevantly update their training in the OHS area. Conclusions The developments in AI-assisted robots come with inherent risks and threats to the working environment. New challenges create the need for adapting EU laws to changing reality. In order to structure European Union legislation on health and safety at work, these changes could be defined in a single piece of legislation covering robotics and AI after detailed analysis, dialogue, and debate.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12995-021-00301-7,springer

Lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous in applications ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Irrespective of the application, reliable real-time estimation of battery state of health (SOH) by on-board computers is crucial to the safe operation of the battery, ultimately safeguarding asset integrity.

We propose a novel machine-learning algorithm for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, which plays an essential role in medical data transmission. In this regard, high-speed pre-emptive decision-based multi-layer extreme learning machines are implemented for co-operative spectrums sensing in CR health care networks. For a radio channel, different vectors such as energy levels, distance, Channel ID, sensor values are determined at CR devices and are considered as a feature vector and thus used to feed into the proposed classifier for the determination of the availability of the channel. The classifier further categorizes the parameters such as user identification i.e., primary and secondary users, availability of channels, and the most crucial predictive decision of the available channels.

Deep learning implementations in the health care industry are mostly related to traditional examples of the technology of medical tests for detecting diseases through image processing or computer viewing techniques. Another source of information that is often ignored, if not more important than medical scanning, is the electronic health record (EHR), which can change the way to access valuable features and data from patients' medical records. The electronic health record (EHR) model's comprehensive adoption allows large-scale collection of health data from real clinical settings. In this paper, the Adaptive Hybridized Deep Neural Network has been proposed for electronic health records. Deep Neural Network has been utilized for the effective clinical record system.

Inspired by the real scenario of pathologists reading pathological images for diagnosis, we integrate pathological images and structured data extracted from clinical electronic medical record (EMR) to further improve the accuracy of breast cancer classification. Methods In this paper, we propose a new richer fusion network for the classification of benign and malignant breast cancer based on multimodal data. To make pathological image can be integrated more sufficient with structured EMR data, we proposed a method to extract richer multilevel feature representation of the pathological image from multiple convolutional layers. Meanwhile, to minimize the information loss for each modality before data fusion, we use the denoising autoencoder as a way to increase the low-dimensional structured EMR data to high-dimensional, instead of reducing the high-dimensional image data to low-dimensional before data fusion. In addition, denoising autoencoder naturally generalizes our method to make the accurate prediction with partially missing structured EMR data. Results The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the most advanced method in terms of the average classification accuracy (92.9%). In addition, we have released a dataset containing structured data from 185 patients that were extracted from EMR and 3764 paired pathological images of breast cancer, which can be publicly downloaded from http://ear.ict.ac.cn/?page_id=1663 . Conclusions We utilized a new richer fusion network to integrate highly heterogeneous data to leverage the structured EMR data to improve the accuracy of pathological image classification. Therefore, the application of automatic breast cancer classification algorithms in clinical practice becomes possible. Due to the generality of the proposed fusion method, it can be straightforwardly extended to the fusion of other structured data and unstructured data.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12911-020-01340-6,springer

Therefore, many scholars have proposed a medical image segmentation method based on deep learning, which has achieved good results in the field of medical image segmentation. However, this type of method has the following problems in the application process: (1) Medical image segmentation target boundary positioning problem. Constrained by factors such as medical image contrast, heterogeneity, and boundary resolution, existing convolution models still cannot accurately locate boundaries. (2) Deep adaptability of deep learning network structure to medical images. Because medical images have more distinct and different feature information than natural images, the current deep learning-based medical segmentation methods have not fully considered this feature. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-level boundary-aware RUNet segmentation model. The network structure consists of a U-Net-based segmentation network and a multi-level boundary detection network. It can solve the problem of boundary positioning. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of poor adaptability of deep learning network structures to medical images, this paper proposes to introduce a new interactive self-attention module into deep learning models. It can make the feature map get global information, and realize the effective extraction of medical image feature information. It solves the problem of weak matching between the deep learning network structure and medical images. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes an image segmentation algorithm based on a multi-layer boundary perception-self-attention mechanism deep learning model.

Moreover, while heart rate data are both ubiquitous and noninvasive, there has been little research specifically for anomaly detection of this type of data. Considering that heart rate data are indicative of both potential health complications and an individual’s physical activity, this is a rich source of largely overlooked data.

The objective of this study was to construct models by implementing machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict BMI classifications (≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2) in administrative healthcare claims databases, and then internally and externally validate them. Methods Five advanced ML algorithms were implemented for each BMI classification on a random sampling of BMI readings from the Optum PanTher Electronic Health Record database (2%) and the Optum Clinformatics Date of Death (20%) database, while incorporating baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Sensitivity analyses with oversampling ratios were conducted. Model performance was validated internally and externally. Results Models trained on the Super Learner ML algorithm (SLA) yielded the best BMI classification predictive performance. SLA model 1 utilized sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including baseline BMI values; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was approximately 88% for the prediction of BMI classifications of ≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2 (internal validation), while accuracy ranged from 87.9% to 92.8% and specificity ranged from 91.8% to 94.7%. SLA model 2 utilized sociodemographic information and clinical characteristics, excluding baseline BMI values; ROC AUC was approximately 73% for the prediction of BMI classifications of ≥ 30, ≥ 35, and ≥ 40 kg/m^2 (internal validation), while accuracy ranged from 73.6% to 80.0% and specificity ranged from 71.6% to 85.9%. The external validation on the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database yielded relatively consistent results with slightly diminished performance. Conclusion This study demonstrated the feasibility and validity of using ML algorithms to predict BMI classifications in administrative healthcare claims data to expand the utility for RWE generation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12325-020-01605-6,springer

However, most existing methods for the task treat herbs with different surface forms orthogonally and determine efficacy-specific herbal groups based on the raw frequencies an herbal group occur in a collection of prescriptions. Such methods entirely overlook the fact that prescriptions in TCM are formed empirically by different people at different historical stages, and thus full of herbs with different surface forms expressing the same material, or even noisy and redundant herbs. Methods We propose a two-stage approach for efficacy-specific herbal group detection from prescriptions in TCM. For the first stage we devise a hierarchical attentive neural network model to capture essential herbs in a prescription for its efficacy, where herbs are encoded with dense real-valued vectors learned automatically to identify their differences on the semantical level. For the second stage, frequent patterns are mined to discover essential herbal groups for an efficacy from distilled prescriptions obtained in the first stage. Results We verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach from two aspects, the first one is the ability of the hierarchical attentive neural network model to distill a prescription, and the second one is the accuracy in discovering efficacy-specific herbal groups. Conclusion The experimental results demonstrate that the hierarchical attentive neural network model is capable to capture herbs in a prescription essential to its efficacy, and the distilled prescriptions significantly could improve the performance of efficacy-specific herbal group detection.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12911-021-01411-2,springer

To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative model of conditional-deep convolutional generative adversarial network (C-DCGAN) and provide a study in detail. Deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), based on traditional generative adversarial networks (GAN), introduces convolutional neural network into the training for unsupervised learning to improve the effect of generative networks. Conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is a conditional model obtained through introducing conditional extension into GAN. C-DCGAN is a combination of DCGAN and CGAN. In C-DCGAN, based on the feature extraction ability of convolutional networks, through the structural optimization, conditional auxiliary generative samples are used as augmented data and applied in machine fault diagnosis. Two datasets (Bearing dataset and Planetary gear box dataset) are carried out to validate. The simulation experiments showed that the improved performance is mainly due to the generated signals from C-DCGAN to balance the dataset. The proposed method can deal with imbalanced fault classification problem much more effectively. This model could improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and the generalization ability of the classifier in the case of small samples and display better fault diagnosis performance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-020-01579-w,springer

Automatic image processing and feature extraction from multimodal sources such as visual fields, optical coherence tomography and fundus photos can be combined with patient demographic, environmental and genetic data to achieve identification and grading of ophthalmic diseases and produce progression, and treatment predictions. In the below chapter, encouraging evidence of these emerging methods is described in the realms of surgical, corneal, retinal, and neuro-ophthalmic topics. While researchers have shown theoretical utility of AI systems, the validation of the proposed techniques on real-world external clinical data, a prerequisite to translating the techniques to patient care, is often times lacking or unsuccessful. Despite this, the potential of AI as a diagnostic and screening tool to improve patient care highlights the continued need for experimental approaches to be applied to tasks which have the potential to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment, improve diagnostic accuracy, predict progression of disease for better monitoring and earlier intervention, detect imaging features which may not be noticeable to manual imaging graders, and provide expert-level diagnosis and treatment recommendations to underserved areas.

OM’s motto is the reality of the world and the human body, a subtle understanding of the mind, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs in our lives. According to Indian philosophy, OM is a spiritual symbol called Atman Brahman (Reality, World, Truth, God, Supreme Spirit, Cosmic Principles, and Knowledge). This research has the symbol of global OM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Gayatri Mantra recitation and Om recitation on human health. Gayatri mantra is a highly potential mantra, which is mentioned in Rig Veda. The study/Yagyopathy Experiment was performed on some patients (Male = 4) and (Females = 7) with an age range of 44–70 years. All patients were trained for reciting Gayatri mantra for 3 days. The baseline data were used. The participants participated in Gayatri mantra and Om recitation about 15 min for two consecutive days. The sequence of the session was assigned randomly to the participants. This preliminary study shows that both Gayatri mantras and sitting comfort have led to increased attention, as measured by the stroop task. However, Gayatri’s mantra effect was significantly greater than Om’s recitation. During the meeting on yagyopathy chaired by Shraddhey Dr. Sahab at Shantikunj on 23 Nov 18, Prof. Rohit Rastogi volunteered to experiment its effects on himself. I consulted Dr. Vandana Srivastava and was advised following treatment: yagyopathy twice a day, at sunrise and sunset, with havan samagri for asthma and normal samagri in 3:1 ratio, recitation of Surya Gayatri mantra 24 times and nadi-shodhan pranayama for 30 min. Kwath of mixed hawan samagri twice a day. In order to measure the efficacy of Yagyopathy, I undertook Lung Function Test (LFT) on 18 Dec 18 and started yagyopathy as above instructions (once a day) since 24 Dec 18. Following, three important parameters are measured during LFT: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): a measure of lung capacity/volume of air can open after Deep inhalation. Forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV1): Breath measurement. FEV1/FVC: The ratio of lung size (FVC) that expires in seconds. The results obtained after undertaking yagyopathy treatment once a day for approximately 2 1/2 months indicated considerable improvement in lung function parameters.

Healthcare systems are challenged with incorporating new and unfamiliar technology into existing systems of practice. As diagnostic tools such as artificial intelligence have entered the realm of clinical practice, new opportunities have arisen to optimize healthcare delivery. Overreliance on AI may lead to the dehumanization of medicine. However, with appropriate implementation, AI can free up time and resources to allow healthcare providers to focus on aspects of care that are unique humanistic. Effective medical practice requires availability of data, application of information, and appropriate clinical judgement. A large portion of modern patient care takes place without the presence of the patient. AI has shown the potential to synthesize and summarize vast amounts of data from medical records, clinical trials, and best-practice guidelines. By tailoring all available data to each case, AI can serve as an asset in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and increasing the efficiency of healthcare delivery. However, clinical decisions made between patients and their physicians cannot be reduced to a set of parameters, code, or logic trees. Clinical judgment and the implementation of available information remains necessarily human tasks.

We propose to train simultaneously two neural networks for image selection and a target task using reinforcement learning. A controller network learns an image selection policy by maximising an accumulated reward based on the target task performance on the controller-selected validation set, whilst the target task predictor is optimised using the training set. The trained controller is therefore able to reject images that lead to poor accuracy in the target task. In this work, we show that controller-predicted IQA can be significantly different from task-specific quality labels manually defined by humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn effective IQA without a “clean” validation set, thereby avoiding the requirement for human labels of task amenability. Using 6712, labelled and segmented, clinical ultrasound images from 259 patients, experimental results on holdout data show that the proposed IQA achieved a mean classification accuracy of $$0.94\pm 0.01$$ 0.94 ± 0.01 and a mean segmentation Dice of $$0.89\pm 0.02$$ 0.89 ± 0.02 , by discarding $$5\%$$ 5 % and $$15\%$$ 15 % of the acquired images, respectively.

To achieve this goal, new approaches and strategies along with novel technologies, informatics, and identification of practical clinical paradigms need to be implemented. The great amount of data coming from clinical trials; routine care; databases; registries, including clinical, cognitive, and advanced neuroimaging data; omics (genomics/transcriptomics/proteomics/metabolomics); and clot composition analysis should be shared across centers, collected using standardized methods and a high-quality big data approach, and made available as a fertile ground for future studies.

The testing and training data can be possibly from different sensor locations. Consequently, different data distributions exist, which remarkably deteriorates the data-driven model performance in different scenarios.

It uses an anisotropic convex polytope, which, models the shape of the neuron neighborhood, and employs a novel kind of edge, called bridge, which carries information on the extent of the distribution time change. In order to take into account the high dimensionality of data, a novel neural network, named GCCA, which embeds G-EXIN as the basic quantization tool, allows a real-time non-linear dimensionality reduction based on the Curvilinear Component Analysis. If, instead, a hierarchical tree is requested for the interpretation of data clustering, the new network GH-EXIN can be used. It uses G-EXIN for the clustering of each tree node dataset. This chapter illustrates the basic ideas of this family of neural networks and shows their performance by means of synthetic and real experiments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-51870-7_7,springer

In recent years, the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has provided a comprehensive data source for intelligent clinical applications including the TEP investigated in this study. Method We examined the problem of using a large volume of heterogeneous EHR data to predict treatment effects and developed an adversarial deep treatment effect prediction model to address the problem. Our model employed two auto-encoders for learning the representative and discriminative features of both patient characteristics and treatments from EHR data. The discriminative power of the learned features was further enhanced by decoding the correlational information between the patient characteristics and subsequent treatments by means of a generated adversarial learning strategy. Thereafter, a logistic regression layer was appended on the top of the resulting feature representation layer for TEP. Result The proposed model was evaluated on two real clinical datasets collected from the cardiology department of a Chinese hospital. In particular, on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dataset, the proposed adversarial deep treatment effect prediction (ADTEP) (0.662) exhibited 1.4, 2.2, and 6.3% performance gains in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) over deep treatment effect prediction (DTEP) (0.653), logistic regression (LR) (0.648), and support vector machine (SVM) (0.621), respectively. As for heart failure (HF) case study, the proposed ADTEP also outperformed all benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model achieved competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in tackling the TEP problem. Conclusion In this work, we propose a novel model to address the TEP problem by utilizing a large volume of observational data from EHR. With adversarial learning strategy, our proposed model can further explore the correlational information between patient statuses and treatments to extract more robust and discriminative representation of patient samples from their EHR data. Such representation finally benefits the model on TEP. The experimental results of two case studies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12911-020-01151-9,springer

The feature determination strategy provides us with a way to reduce calculation time, improve prediction execution, and have a better understanding of data in machine learning, as well as a way to recognize applications. As pointed out by related works that have been reviewed, in general, existing works only focus on amplifying classification accuracy.

Evidence acquisition A detailed search of original articles was performed using the PubMed-MEDLINE database to identify recent English literature relevant to ML, DL and CNN applications in cystoscopic image recognition. Evidence synthesis In total, two articles and one conference abstract were identified addressing the application of AI methods in cystoscopic image recognition. These investigations showed accuracies exceeding 90% for tumor detection; however, future work is necessary to incorporate these methods into AI-aided cystoscopy and compared to other tumor visualization tools.

Recently, there is a great growth of data requests and FC which lead to enhance data accessibility and adaptability. However, FC has been exposed to many challenges as load balancing (LB) and adaptation to failure. Many LB strategies have been proposed in cloud computing, but they are still not applied effectively in fog. LB is an important issue to achieve high resource utilization, avoid bottlenecks, avoid overload and low load, and reduce response time. In this paper, a LB and optimization strategy (LBOS) using dynamic resource allocation method based on Reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm is proposed. LBOS monitors the traffic in the network continuously, collects the information about each server load, handles the incoming requests, and distributes them between the available servers equally using dynamic resource allocation method. Hence, it enhances the performance even when it’s the peak time. Accordingly, LBOS is simple and efficient in real-time systems in fog computing such as in the case of healthcare system. LBOS is concerned with designing an IoT-Fog based healthcare system. The proposed IoT-Fog system consists of three layers, namely: (1) IoT layer, (2) fog layer, and (3) cloud layer. Finally, the experiments are carried out and the results show that the proposed solution improves the quality-of-service in the cloud/fog computing environment in terms of the allocation cost and reduce the response time. Comparing the LBOS with the state-of-the-art algorithms, it achieved the best load balancing Level (85.71%).

However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: −7.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean ± 1.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic.

It has been demonstrated that this system can provide reliable physiological monitoring for patients in general wards and has the potential to generate more personalized pathophysiological information related to disease diagnosis and treatment from the continuously monitored physiological data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10916-020-01653-z,springer

There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems. Methods A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions. Results Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1–88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0–31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days.

We plan to apply a digital integrated healthcare platform using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dietary management solution and a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to overcome those limitations. Furthermore, medical staff will be performing monitoring and intervention to encourage continuous use of the program. The aim of this trial is to examine the efficacy of the program in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have HbA1c 53–69 mmol/mol (7.0–8.5%) and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23 mg/m^2. Methods This is a 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial consisting of patients with type 2 diabetes. The patients will be randomly assigned to three groups: control group A will receive routine diabetes care; experimental group B will use the digital integrated healthcare platform by themselves without feedback; and experimental group C will use the digital integrated healthcare platform with continuous glucose monitoring and feedback from medical staff. There are five follow-up measures: baseline and post-intervention at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. The primary end point is change in HbA1c from baseline to six months after the intervention.

Timely fault identification and location of the ATRU is significant in terms of system reliability. A two-level fault diagnosis method for the ATRU using multi-source features (MSF) is proposed in this paper. Based on the topology of the ATRU, three key electrical signals are selected and analyzed to extract appropriate features for fault diagnosis. Mathematic expressions and simulation results of the feature signals under different fault modes are presented in the paper. Therefore, a unique MSF system is developed and a two-level fault diagnosis method based on radial basis function network groups is proposed. On the first level, the overall fault set is classified into three subsets and then on the second level, three radial basis function neural networks are constructed and trained to realize accurate fault localization. To verify the diagnosis performance of the proposed method, several comparative tests are implemented on a 12-pulse ATRU system, which shows that this method has a lower computational cost, better diagnostic accuracy and increased stability when compared with alternative methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s43236-020-00057-z,springer

Two augmentation methods are investigated including sample-based and dataset-based methods, and five augmentation techniques are considered in general, i.e. additional Gaussian noise, masking noise, signal translation, amplitude shifting and time stretching.

The work presented in this manuscript introduces an SHM methodology based on a Semi-supervised damage detection algorithm that uses preliminary findings to reinforce the selection of features used to identify damage. The methodology proposes a novel technique for feature extraction by sorting the acceleration values in each vibration response. Then, an adaptive feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most sensitive characteristics of the feature for damage detection. This technique enhances the correlation between measurements of the same blade status and therefore the performance of the proposed SHM methodology.

Subsequently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for pathology imaging has been largely facilitated by DCNN approaches. However, because DCNNs require massive amounts of labeled data, the lack of availability of such pathology image data as well as the high cost of labeling new data is currently a major problem. To avoid expensive data labeling efforts, transfer learning is a concept intended to overcome training data shortages by passing knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. However, weak relevance between the source and target domains generally leads to less effective transfers. Therefore, following the natural step-by-step process by which humans learn and make inferences, a stepwise fine-tuning scheme is proposed by introducing intermediate domains to bridge the source and target domains. The DCNNs are expected to acquire general object classification knowledge from a source domain dataset such as ImageNet and pathology-related knowledge from intermediate domain data, which serve as fundamental and specific knowledge, respectively, for the final benign/malignant classification task. To realize this, we introduce several ways to provide pathology-related knowledge by generating an intermediate dataset classified into various corresponding pathology features.

However, because some anatomy sites have similar appearances and anatomical landmarks are lacking, gastric-anatomy image annotations are less than accurate. The annotations by doctors with various experience levels vary widely. Deep learning–based systems trained on these noisy annotations have poor recognition performance. In this work, we propose a novel data refinement approach to alleviate the problem of noisy annotations and improve the upper gastrointestinal anatomy recognition performance. In essence, we introduce a new uncertainty inference module for deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and leverage Bayesian uncertainty estimates to select possibly noisy data. In addition, we employ an ensemble of semi-supervised learning to rectify noisy labels and produce refined training data. We validate the proposed approach via controlled experiments on CIFAR-10, in which the noise rate is adjusted and noisy data are made known. It shows much improvement on classification accuracy using the refined dataset, and outperforms state-of-the-art robust training methods, e.g., MentorNet and Co-teaching. An evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal anatomy recognition task proves that our proposed method effectively improves the recognition accuracy for real, noisy clinical data.

But the procedure involved is costly and invasive in nature. So, the commonly used procedure is to obtain computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain, which provides static greyscale images. The biggest drawback of a CT scan is that the images are in greyscale; therefore, it is difficult for the naked eye to distinguish the subtle changes in the brain tissues. A wrong prognosis, in this case, could lead to the death of a patient. In this paper, we propose an AI-assisted diagnosis method where a predictive model is deployed, which can discern even the subtlest of the differences in the brain tissues and can help determine any anomalies.

Three models have been used and evaluated as surrogates: random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and Kriging. Sample convolutional configurations are generated by Latin hypercube sampling and have attached computed accuracy outcomes from real CNN runs. For the hyperparameter estimation task, the fitness of an individual from the EA associated with a surrogate model is subsequently derived from the CNN accuracy estimation on those variable values.

The authors surveyed articles in the life sciences that included machine learning applications, and found that interdisciplinary collaborations increased the scientific validity of published research. Machine learning (ML) has become an essential asset for the life sciences and medicine. We selected 250 articles describing ML applications from 17 journals sampling 26 different fields between 2011 and 2016. Independent evaluation by two readers highlighted three results. First, only half of the articles shared software, 64% shared data and 81% applied any kind of evaluation. Although crucial for ensuring the validity of ML applications, these aspects were met more by publications in lower-ranked journals. Second, the authors’ scientific backgrounds highly influenced how technical aspects were addressed: reproducibility and computational evaluation methods were more prominent with computational co-authors; experimental proofs more with experimentalists. Third, 73% of the ML applications resulted from interdisciplinary collaborations comprising authors from at least two of the three disciplines: computational sciences, biology, and medicine. The results suggested collaborations between computational and experimental scientists to generate more scientifically sound and impactful work integrating knowledge from both domains. Although scientifically more valid solutions and collaborations involving diverse expertise did not correlate with impact factors, such collaborations provide opportunities to both sides: computational scientists are given access to novel and challenging real-world biological data, increasing the scientific impact of their research, and experimentalists benefit from more in-depth computational analyses improving the technical correctness of work.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0139-8,springer

Unlike the previous work which focus mainly on the numerical feature, in our framework, we combine both numerical and textual information to predict the acceptance of answers. The textual information is composed of questions posted by the patients and answers posted by the doctors. To extract the textual features from them, we first trained a sentence encoder to encode a pair of question and answer into a co-dependent representation on a held-out dataset. After that,we can use it to predict the acceptance of answers by doctors. Results Our experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that by applying our model additional features from text can be extracted and the prediction can be more accurate. That’s to say, the model which take both textual features and numerical features as input performs significantly better than model which takes numerical features only on all the four metrics (Accuracy, AUC, F1-score and Recall). Conclusions This work proposes a generic framework combining numerical features and textual features for acceptance prediction, where textual features are extracted from text based on deep learning methods firstly and can be used to achieve a better prediction results.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12859-019-3129-2,springer

However, bandwidth constraint has been the primary bottleneck for efficient telementoring systems. This study aims to establish an efficient surgical telementoring system, where the qualified surgeon (mentor) provides real-time guidance and technical assistance for surgical procedures to the on-spot physician (surgeon). High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265)–based video compression has shown promising results for telementoring applications. However, there is a trade-off between the bandwidth resources required for video transmission and quality of video received by the remote surgeon. In order to efficiently compress and transmit real-time surgical videos, a hybrid lossless-lossy approach is proposed where surgical incision region is coded in high quality whereas the background region is coded in low quality based on distance from the surgical incision region. For surgical incision region extraction, state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures for semantic segmentation can be used. However, the computational complexity of these architectures is high resulting in large training and inference times. For telementoring systems, encoding time is crucial; therefore, very deep architectures are not suitable for surgical incision extraction. In this study, we propose a shallow convolutional neural network (S-CNN)–based segmentation approach that consists of encoder network only for surgical region extraction. The segmentation performance of S-CNN is compared with one of the state-of-the-art image segmentation networks (SegNet), and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network. The proposed telementoring system is efficient and explicitly considers the physiological nature of the human visual system to encode the video by providing good overall visual impact in the location of surgery. The results of the proposed S-CNN-based segmentation demonstrated a pixel accuracy of 97% and a mean intersection over union accuracy of 79%. Similarly, HEVC experimental results showed that the proposed surgical region–based encoding scheme achieved an average bitrate reduction of 88.8% at high-quality settings in comparison with default full-frame HEVC encoding. The average gain in encoding performance (signal-to-noise) of the proposed algorithm is 11.5 dB in the surgical region. The bitrate saving and visual quality of the proposed optimal bit allocation scheme are compared with the mean shift segmentation–based coding scheme for fair comparison. The results show that the proposed scheme maintains high visual quality in surgical incision region along with achieving good bitrate saving. Based on comparison and results, the proposed encoding algorithm can be considered as an efficient and effective solution for surgical telementoring systems for low-bandwidth networks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10278-019-00206-2,springer

Wearable medical devices with sensor, health cloud and mobile applications have continuously generating a huge amount of data which is often called as streaming big data. Due to the higher speed of the data generation, it is difficult to collect, process and analyze such massive data in real-time in order to perform real-time actions in case of emergencies and extracting hidden value. using traditional methods which are limited and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need to real-time big data stream processing to ensure an effective and scalable solution. In order to overcome this issue, this work proposes a new architecture for real-time health status prediction and analytics system using big data technologies. The system focus on applying distributed machine learning model on streaming health data events ingested to Spark streaming through Kafka topics. Firstly, we transform the standard decision tree (DT) (C4.5) algorithm into a parallel, distributed, scalable and fast DT using Spark instead of Hadoop MapReduce which becomes limited for real-time computing. Secondly, this model is applied to streaming data coming from distributed sources of various diseases to predict health status. Based on several input attributes, the system predicts health status, send an alert message to care providers and store the details in a distributed database to perform health data analytics and stream reporting. We measure the performance of Spark DT against traditional machine learning tools including Weka.

Recently, deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many healthcare prediction tasks. However, deep models lack interpretability, which is integral to successful decision-making and can lead to better patient care. In this paper, we build upon the contextual decomposition (CD) method, an algorithm for producing importance scores from long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). We extend the method to bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) and use it in the context of predicting future clinical outcomes using patients’ EHR historical visits. Methods We use a real EHR dataset comprising 11071 patients, to evaluate and compare CD interpretations from LSTM and BiLSTM models. First, we train LSTM and BiLSTM models for the task of predicting which pre-school children with respiratory system-related complications will have asthma at school-age. After that, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis to evaluate the CD interpretations produced by the contextual decomposition of the trained models. In addition, we develop an interactive visualization to demonstrate the utility of CD scores in explaining predicted outcomes. Results Our experimental evaluation demonstrate that whenever a clear visit-level pattern exists, the models learn that pattern and the contextual decomposition can appropriately attribute the prediction to the correct pattern. In addition, the results confirm that the CD scores agree to a large extent with the importance scores generated using logistic regression coefficients. Our main insight was that rather than interpreting the attribution of individual visits to the predicted outcome, we could instead attribute a model’s prediction to a group of visits.

So, for the rationality of feature selection and the diversity of classifier design in the gesture recognition process based on electromyography (EMG) signals, this paper proposes a hand medical monitoring system based on feature selection method of feature subset average recognition rate and optimal machine learning algorithm selection, which mainly depends on the prediction of hand movement. At the same time, since most experiments are conducted in different non-public proprietary databases, the comparison between various gesture recognition methods can only be analyzed to a certain extent. Therefore, this paper uses the DB1 dataset in the large publicly available NinaPro database and combines with presently well-known 11 time-domain (TD) features and 5 frequency domain (FD) features, then uses the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to comparative analysis total 136 feature combinations under various feature numbers. Under the premise of ensuring the overall recognition rate of electromyography gesture, this method will be able to reduce the number of features in feature set, according to the change of the average remove redundant features, and construct an optimal reduced EMG feature set. Finally, through the four common hand motion classifiers based on machine learning: SVM, back propagation neural network, linear discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbor, this paper tests and verifies the separability of the optimal reduced EMG feature set, and based on this, selects the optimal hand motion classifier to build the optimal hand motion recognition system, improve the hand medical monitoring system, and provide technical reference for the construction of real-time medical monitoring system.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00779-019-01285-2,springer

A number of appreciable SHM techniques had been reported that utilizes wired or wireless smart sensors, but the use of nondestructive techniques, such as, digital high speed imaging were rarely employed for detection of dynamic vibrations of civil structures. In the current research, we have developed a high speed video imaging based structural health monitoring system that utilizes blob detection based motion tracking algorithm. It provides factual information regarding localization and displacement of the target object or an existing feature in the civil structure. The modal parameters were subsequently extracted to analyze the level of severity of structural damage within the civil structures. Also, an artificial neural network is trained to infer the qualitative characteristics of structural vibrations based on vibration intensity and the network inferences can be correlated with the conditions of the structure. The efficacy of our vision system in remote measurement of dynamic displacements was demonstrated through a shaking table and a slip desk experiment.

These technologies have generated a lot of “hype,” but their real-world effectiveness will depend on patients’ uptake. Our objective was to describe patients’ perceptions of the use of BMDs and AI in healthcare. We recruited adult patients with chronic conditions in France from the “Community of Patients for Research” (ComPaRe). Participants (1) answered quantitative and open-ended questions about the potential benefits and dangers of using of these new technologies and (2) participated in a case-vignette experiment to assess their readiness for using BMDs and AI in healthcare. Vignettes covered the use of AI to screen for skin cancer, remote monitoring of chronic conditions to predict exacerbations, smart clothes to guide physical therapy, and AI chatbots to answer emergency calls. A total of 1183 patients (51% response rate) were enrolled between May and June 2018. Overall, 20% considered that the benefits of technology (e.g., improving the reactivity in care and reducing the burden of treatment) greatly outweighed the dangers. Only 3% of participants felt that negative aspects (inadequate replacement of human intelligence, risks of hacking and misuse of private patient data) greatly outweighed potential benefits. We found that 35% of patients would refuse to integrate at least one existing or soon-to-be available intervention using BMDs and AI-based tools in their care.

To solve the shortage of medical reimbursement mechanisms based on medical service items, single-disease payment models have been extensively studied.

Herein, we present an anti-fraud framework for medical insurance based on deep learning to automatically identify suspicious medical records, ensure the effective implementation of single-disease charges, and reduce the workload of medical insurance auditors. The framework first predicts the probabilities of diseases according to patients’ chief complaints and then evaluates whether the disease codes written in medical records are reasonable via the predicted probabilities; finally, medical records with unreasonable disease codes are selected as abnormal cases for manual auditing.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to reduce the impact and prevalence of ADEs within the healthcare sector, not only since it will result in reducing human suffering, but also as a means to substantially reduce economical strains on the healthcare system. One approach to mitigate this problem is to employ predictive models. While existing methods have been focusing on the exploitation of static features, limited attention has been given to temporal features. Methods In this paper, we present a novel classification framework for detecting ADEs in complex Electronic health records (EHRs) by exploiting the temporality and sparsity of the underlying features. The proposed framework consists of three phases for transforming sparse and multi-variate time series features into a single-valued feature representation, which can then be used by any classifier. Moreover, we propose and evaluate three different strategies for leveraging feature sparsity by incorporating it into the new representation. Results A large-scale evaluation on 15 ADE datasets extracted from a real-world EHR system shows that the proposed framework achieves significantly improved predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art. Moreover, our framework can reveal features that are clinically consistent with medical findings on ADE detection. Conclusions Our study and experimental findings demonstrate that temporal multi-variate features of variable length and with high sparsity can be effectively utilized to predict ADEs from EHRs. Two key advantages of our framework are that it is method agnostic, i.e., versatile, and of low computational cost, i.e., fast; hence providing an important building block for future exploitation within the domain of machine learning from EHRs.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12911-018-0717-4,springer

The purpose of this review is to synthesize the research that has been conducted on automated detection of NMSC using digital images and to assess the quality of evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of these technologies. Methods Eight databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and the ACM Digital Library) were searched to identify diagnostic studies of NMSC using image-based machine learning models. Two reviewers independently screened eligible articles. The level of evidence of each study was evaluated using a five tier rating system, and the applicability and risk of bias of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Results Thirty-nine studies were reviewed. Twenty-four models were designed to detect basal cell carcinoma, two were designed to detect squamous cell carcinoma, and thirteen were designed to detect both. All studies were conducted in silico. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the classifiers, defined as concordance with histopathologic diagnosis, was high, with reported accuracies ranging from 72 to 100% and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.832 to 1. Most studies had substantial methodological limitations, but several were robustly designed and presented a high level of evidence. Conclusion Most studies of image-based NMSC classifiers report performance greater than or equal to the reported diagnostic accuracy of the average dermatologist, but relatively few studies have presented a high level of evidence. Clinical studies are needed to assess whether these technologies can feasibly be implemented as a real-time aid for clinical diagnosis of NMSC.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12880-019-0307-7,springer

The dataset has been built from sensor data in the plant and formatted to use with Tensorflow package in Python. Then a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is used to predict and estimate the ideal behavior of the valve without wear and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the real behavior of the valve with wear.

The medical industry is creating additional services for health- and life-promotion programs. This change represents a medical-service paradigm shift due to the prolonged life expectancy, aging, lifestyle changes, and income increases, and consequently, the concept of the smart health service has emerged as a major issue. Due to smart health, the existing health-promotion medical services that typically have been operated by large hospitals have been developing into remote medical-treatment services where personal health records are used in small hospitals; moreover, a further expansion has been occurring in the direction of u-Healthcare in which health conditions are continuously monitored in the everyday lives of the users. However, as the amount of data is increasing and the medical-data complexity is intensifying, the limitations of the previous approaches are increasingly problematic; furthermore, since even the same disease can show different symptoms depending on the personal health conditions, lifestyle, and genome information, universal healthcare is not effective for some patients, and it can even generate severe side effects. Thus, research on the AI-based healthcare that is in the form of mining-based smart health, which is a convergence technology of the 4IR, is actively being carried out. Particularly, the introduction of various smart medical equipment for which healthcare big data and a running machine have been combined and the expansion of the distribution of smartphone wearable devices have led to innovations such as personalized diagnostic and treatment services and chronic-disease management and prevention services. In addition, various already launched applications allow users to check their own health conditions and receive the corresponding feedback in real time. Based on these innovations, the preparation of a way to determine a user’s current health conditions, and to respond properly through contextual feedback in the case of unsound health conditions, is underway. However, since the previously made healthcare-related applications need to be linked to a wearable device, and they provide medical feedback to users based solely on specific biometric data, inaccurate information can be provided. In addition, the user interfaces of some healthcare applications are very complicated, causing user inconvenience regarding the attainment of desired information. Therefore, we propose a chatbot-based healthcare service with a knowledge base for cloud computing. The proposed method is a mobile health service in the form of a chatbot for the provision of fast treatment in response to accidents that may occur in everyday life, and also in response to changes of the conditions of patients with chronic diseases. A chatbot is an intelligent conversation platform that interacts with users via a chatting interface, and since its use can be facilitated by linkages with the major social network service messengers, general users can easily access and receive various health services. The proposed framework enables a smooth human–robot interaction that supports the efficient implementation of the chatbot healthcare service. The design of the framework comprises the following four levels: data level, information level, knowledge level, and service level.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10586-018-2334-5,springer

To improve the safety and practicability of machinery, fault diagnostic systems have become essential. This study employed a neural network algorithm to implement fault diagnosis. This study proposed a 3D printer fault diagnostic system that incorporated a neural network with a graphic interface. The MPU6050 accelerometer was combined with an Arduino microcontroller to monitor the status of a 3D printer. The neural network simulated the relationships of faults and training, and adopted different transfer functions to compare their training and convergence performance. The data were transferred to Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench after training and were displayed on a human machine interface, enabling users to explicitly identify the potential location of faults in a machine. This system ameliorates the work efficiency of managers and achieves real-time fault diagnosis. Moreover, the proposed 3D printer fault diagnostic system identified neural network parameters (e.g., the number of neurons, the learning rate, and the number of training) suitable for this system through various static and dynamic simulation experiments. Various shapes were adopted for testing the detection rate of the 3D printer fault diagnostic system. Finally, the real-time dynamic printing status data were recorded for approximately 10 min consecutively, yielding 6000 pieces of data, and that the transfer functions in the hidden and output layers were adopted for static simulation.

Also, Alzheimer’s disease, one of the five most severe non-communicable diseases all around the world, receives much attention in both academic research and clinical diagnosis for the time being. It is generally acknowledged that magnetic resonance imaging, a popular imaging tool because of its free of radiation exposure in terms of patients safety issues, has been vastly employed in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis in recent years. However, most contemporary clinical diagnosis efforts still heavily rely on clinicians’ expertise to realize the disease diagnosis task. In this study, inspired by the recent rapid development of deep learning and low-resource learning techniques, a novel image-based disease diagnosis scheme is proposed to automatically fulfil the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance images. This new end-to-end low-resource learning scheme is conducted following four steps. First, raw arterial spin labeling images need to be acquired and essential pre-processing steps should be carried out on raw images. Second, the popular convolutional neural network technique is adopted to automatically extract latent trainable features from processed arterial spin labelling images, instead of traditional hand-crafted features. Third, a novel low-resource pair-wise learning method inspired by the semi-supervised learning theory is carried out based on latent trainable features for automatically determining disease similarity functions. Forth, learned outcomes are then fed into a multi-nominal logistic regression model and a regression process with the highest posterior probability is capable to reveal the corresponding disease diagnosis outcome. Extensive experiments based on a database composed of magnetic resonance images acquired from 350 real demented patients are carried out with the newly poroposed scheme being compared towards several other well-known diagnosis tools. All diagnosis results have undergone rigorous and comprehensive statistical analysis composed of analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests. The superiority of the new scheme has been demonstrated therein.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-017-4492-5,springer

This paper proposes a physics-based prognostic model for rolling element bearings using the realized volatility (RV) and wavelet neural network (WNN) to predict the remaining life of bearings. The proposed method overcomes the difficulties of forecasting the failure of bearings under various degradation patterns and improves the accuracy of prediction. The faulty signal is extracted using an AR filter to reveal the degradation trend. The prognosis is performed by calculating the RV and energy ratio, which are used to identify the abnormality of vibration in the system and degradation patterns before catastrophic failure occurs. Then, the WNN incorporated with physical inputs from the properties of the bearings predicts the failure cycles. The prediction yields a satisfactory result between the experimental and predicted failure cycle. The prognostic accuracy of the physics-based WNN model is compared with a widely used time-series model, the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The WNN model has an advantage of reducing error over the ARIMA model in various degradation patterns and overcomes the disadvantage of models requiring additional data after significant damage is present in the bearings.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-018-1959-0,springer

Thus information extraction on unstructured clinical notes in EHRs is important which could contribute to huge improvement in patient health management. Besides, temporal related information extraction seems to be more essential since clinical notes are designed to capture states of patients over time. Previous studies mainly focused on English corpus. However, there are very limited research work on Chinese EHRs. Due to the challenges brought by the characteristics of Chinese, it is difficult to apply existing techniques for English on Chinese corpus directly. Considering this situation, we proposed a deep learning based temporal information extraction framework in this paper. Our framework contains three components: data preprocessing, temporal entity extraction and temporal relation extraction. For temporal entity extraction, we proposed a recurrent neural network based model, using bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) with Conditional Random Fields decoding (LSTM-CRF). For temporal relation extraction, we utilize Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify temporal relations between clinical entities and temporal related expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to apply deep learning to temporal information extraction from clinical notes in Chinese EHRs. We conduct extensive sets of experiments on real-world datasets from hospital.

It determines how an individual thinks, feels and handle situations. Positive mental health helps one to work productively and realize their full potential. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems which lead to mental illness like stress, social anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, drug addiction, and personality disorders. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the onset of the mental illness to maintain proper life balance . The nature of machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be fully harnessed for predicting the onset of mental illness. Such applications when implemented in real time will benefit the society by serving as a monitoring tool for individuals with deviant behavior. This research work proposes to apply various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees, naïve bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression to identify state of mental health in a target group. The responses obtained from the target group for the designed questionnaire were first subject to unsupervised learning techniques. The labels obtained as a result of clustering were validated by computing the Mean Opinion Score. These cluster labels were then used to build classifiers to predict the mental health of an individual.

However, the amount of diagnostic imaging procedures has continuously increased over the last decades, imposing several challenges associated with the storage volume, data redundancy and availability. Cloud platforms are focused on delivering hardware and software services over the Internet, becoming an appealing solution for repository outsourcing. Although this option may bring financial and technological benefits, it also presents new challenges. In medical imaging scenarios, communication latency is a critical issue that still hinders the adoption of this paradigm. This paper proposes an intelligent Cloud storage gateway that optimizes data access times. This is achieved through a new cache architecture that combines static rules and pattern recognition for eviction and prefetching. The evaluation results, obtained from experiments over a real-world dataset, show that cache hit ratios can reach around 80%, leading to reductions of image retrieval times by over 60%. The combined use of eviction and prefetching policies proposed can significantly reduce communication latency, even when using a small cache in comparison to the total size of the repository.

The best structure and parameters of each neural network is found via grid search and cross-validation techniques. The experimental design is also employed to select the most governing variables in designing well tests of different reservoir models. Seven real buildup tests are used to validate the proposed approach.

Recombinant and highly purified allergens belonging to different allergenic sources (inhalants, food, latex and hymenoptera) are present in the array. These components can either be genuine or cross-reactive, resistant or susceptible to heat and low pH, and innocuous or potentially dangerous. A large number of complex and heterogeneous relationships among these components has emerged, such that sometimes these interactions cannot be effectively managed by the allergist. In the 1960s, specialized languages and environments were developed to support the replacement of human experts with dedicated decision-making information systems. Currently, expert systems (ES) are advanced informatics tools that are widely used in medicine, engineering, finance and trading. Methods We developed an ES, named Allergenius ®, to support the interpretation of allergy tests based on microarray technology (ImmunoCAP ISAC ®). The ES was implemented using Flex, a LPA Win-Prolog shell. Rules representing the knowledge base (KB) were derived from the literature and specialized databases. The input data included the patient’s ID and disease(s), the results of either a skin prick test or specific IgE assays and ISAC results. The output was a medical report. Results The ES was first validated using artificial and real life cases and passed all in silico validations. Then, the opinions of allergists with experience in molecular diagnostics were compared with the ES reports. The Allergenius reports included all of the allergists’ opinions and considerations, as well as any additional information. Conclusions Allergenius is a trustable ES dedicated to molecular tests for allergy. In the present version, it provides a powerful method to understand ISAC results and to obtain a comprehensive interpretation of the patient’s IgE profiling.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1939-4551-7-15,springer

Because of previous successful application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to the condition monitoring of rotating machinery, an ANN based automated diagnosis system was proposed for the diagnosis of big-end bearing knock faults in IC engines. It consists of three separate ANNs: a fault detection network, a fault localization network, and a fault severity identification network. In order to solve the problem that ANNs need a lot of data for training, a simulation model was built to simulate various degrees of bearing knock faults. The impact forces of the bearing with different clearance were simulated first, and then the accelerations at the measurement point on the engine block were calculated. A series of experiments were also carried out, and the results were used to evaluate and update the simulation model. It was also found that the squared envelope signals, rather the raw acceleration signals, have more useful diagnostic information. The extracted/selected amplitude features were used for fault detection and severity identification, and the extracted/selected phase features were used for fault localization. It is worth pointing out that because a saturating linear function was selected as the transfer function of the ANN for the fault severity identification stage, the networks can linearly classify the fault levels and the output agrees better with the real situation. All the networks were trained using simulated data and tested using experimental data. The final results have verified that the system could efficiently diagnose bearing knock faults, especially the accurate identification of the fault levels.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-06590-8_40,springer

We propose two new systems that deal with large data sets and solves the main problems of the current monitoring system. In fact, the current monitoring system in ICU has many issues to detect real states of patients namely critical and normal states. It frequently generates a high number of false alarms having bad effects on the working conditions. Besides, these alarms can threat the patient life by misleading medical staff. Our aim, in this paper, is to avoid false alarms and keep a high level of sensitivity by improving the current monitoring system. In addition, our purpose is to generate groups of patients suffering from similar diseases and building a general model for similar patients. The obtained models will make the classification of new patients possible. To this end, we combine two incremental versions of support vector machines mainly the LASVM and ISVM techniques with the k-prototypes clustering method. The first proposed system is the KP-ISVM which is based on the ISVM technique and the k-prototypes. The second one is called KP-LASVM which takes profits of both the LASVM by reducing the false alarms and the k-prototypes by selecting the appropriate model to start classifying new patients. Both of our proposals are characterized by dealing with large amount of data streams and adding new patients. However, the system using LASVM and k-prototypes i.e. the KP-LASVM has produced the best results compared to the others monitoring systems and based on different evaluation criteria.

The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting “alert fatigue” and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of “big data” in health care provide the potential not only to perform “in silico” research but also to provide “real time” diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. “On demand” access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine. The combination of AI, big data, and massively parallel computing offers the potential to create a revolutionary way of practicing evidence-based, personalized medicine.",2013-12-13,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11886-013-0441-8,springer

Therefore non-invasive methods that allows to precisely predict the state of the disease are currently one of the key issues in the medical business. The paper presents a novel ensemble of neural networks applied to recognition of liver fibrosis stage from indirect examination method. Several neural network models are build on the basis of outputs of different feature selection algorithms. Then an ensemble pruning procedure with the usage of diversity measures is conducted in order to eliminate redundant predictors from the pool. Finally the weights of classifiers in the fusion process are assessed to establish their influence on the output of the whole ensemble. Proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art ensemble methods. Extensive experimental investigations, carried out on a dataset collected by authors, show that the proposed method achieve a satisfactory level of the fibrosis level recognition, outperforming other machine learning algorithms and thus may be used as a real-time medical decision support system for this task.",2013-11-21,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00930-8_2,springer

Optimized separation conditions were obtained and successfully applied to the separation and determination of dauricine and daurisoline in real samples. The proposed method allows alkaloids in real samples to be determined within 15 min using a buffer system composed of 25 mM HAc, 25 mM NaAc and 2% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20) (pH 4.5). In addition, a radial basis function neural network with a “4-18-1” structure was developed based on the experimental results of orthogonal design and uniform design, and applied to the prediction of peak resolution of dauricine and daurisoline under the optimum separation conditions given by orthogonal design.

We focus in this paper on identifying Acute Lumphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases, and implement our experiments following three learning schemes for a neural model.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for early breast cancer intelligent classification. We combine wavelet theory with neural network theory to construct an improved wavelet neural network (IWNN) for digital mammography classification. Firstly, we combine redundant dyadic wavelet transform with ridgelet transform to enhance the image. Because most of the wavelet coefficients containing signals are retained, the image detail can be kept better. And then, the statistical coefficients of the source regions are extracted as features for classification. At last, the medical images are classified by using IWNN on real datasets MIAS(the Mammographic Image Analysis Society).

Among supervised learning algorithms, there are the so-called Support Vector Machines (SVM), exhibiting accurate solutions and low training time. They are based on the statistical learning theory and provide the solution by minimizing a quadratic type cost function. SVM, in conjunction with the use of kernel methods, provide non-linear classification models, namely separations that cannot be expressed using inequalities on linear combinations of parameters. There are some issues that may reduce the effectiveness of these methods. For example, in multi-center clinical trials, experts from different institutions collect data on many patients. In this case, techniques currently in use determine the model considering all the available data. Although they are well suited to cases under consideration, they do not provide accurate answers in general. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a subset of the training set which contains all available information, providing a model that still generalizes to new testing data. It is also possible that the training sets vary over time, for example, because data are added and modified as a result of new tests or new knowledge. In this case, the current techniques are not able to capture the changes, but need to start the learning process from the beginning. The techniques, which extract only the new knowledge contained in the data and provide the learning model in an incremental way, have the advantage of taking into account only the experiments really useful and speed up the analysis. In this paper, we describe some solutions to these problems, with the support of numerical experiments on the discrimination among differ types of leukemia.",2012-07-20,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-4133-5_3,springer

I argue that although these objections cannot stand as good reasons for a general and a priori rejection of AI assistive technologies as such or as replacements of human care, they demand us to clarify what is at stake, to develop more comprehensive criteria for good care, and to rethink existing practices of care. In response to these challenges, I propose a (modified) capabilities approach to care and emphasize the inherent social dimension of care.

And the fault fusion diagnosis method was proposed according to the overall and local fault detection. Through comparing the output value of motion condition model with the measured value of actual speed and angle, it obtained the overall fault information. Also, it obtained the direct fault information through analyzing the residual which was produced by comparing the output of the performance model with the measured value of the actual voltage and current of the each thruster. According to the decision level information fusion of two kinds of information, it realized the fault diagnosis of thrusters and analyzed the fault degree and reliability.

Most of the PD detection methods could be performed only at the shutdown period of equipments. By using Acoustic Emission (AE), the real-time and online detection could be reachable. Therefore, this paper conducted high voltage test of pre-faulty transformers and measured those PD signals for recognition needed. Afterward, the selected features that proposed in this paper can be extracted from these collected PD signals. According to these features, effective identification of their faulty types can be done using the proposed particle swarm optimization combined with neural network. Finally, with a view to apply in field, this research adds different noise levels to distort the original data. These distorted data are entered for subsequent testing.

Forecasting flow essentially characterize the efficiency and really need to be known in order to diagnose possible malfunction and provide a basis for deciding on appropriate action to be taken by network manager. This paper proposes a novel flow-predictable system (FPS) based on fuzzy neural network. The features of dynamic trends of the network flow are extracted using a decision matrix transform and a qualitative interpretation, and then are used as inputs in the neural network, so that it can be used to fit the smooth curves perfectly.

The heat exchanger efficiency is lower and the temperature in the room will change while the heat load of the room is stable. In this study, fault data are obtained in an experimental test rig. Thermal parameters as suction pressure and room temperature are selected and measured to establish a characteristic description to represent states of system malfunction. A new approach to fault diagnosis is presented by using real data from the test rig. Using the artificial neural network (ANN) in self-learning and pattern recognition modes, the fault is diagnosed with the perception (one type of ANN model) suitable for pattern classification problems.

The feature level uses three parallel neural networks whose structures are the same. The purpose of using neural networks is mainly to get basic probability assignment (BPA) of D-S evidence theory, and the neural networks in feature level are used for local diagnosis. D-S evidence theory is adopted to integrate the local diagnosis results in decision level.

It is claimed that experts use two complex mental processes when interpreting such data, knowledge-based reasoning and pattern recognition. It is argued that existing classification methods are inadequate and that the application of advanced computer-based techniques is vital to the realisation of the full potential of biological monitoring. The paper then concentrates on a pattern recognition approach and demonstrates how Self Organising Maps (SOM), a type of unsupervised-learning neural network, can be used to classify and diagnose river quality. A brief introduction is given to the theory of SOMs and the interpretation of their output, as expressed in feature maps and class templates. SOMs are developed using two different methods of accounting for the confounding effects of environmental factors, and their relative performances are compared. Some improvements to the SOM architecture and functionality that are currently being implemented are briefly described, together with plans to use information theory for the assessment of performance. Finally, it is concluded that the methods of classification/diagnosis described in the paper have considerable potential not only in river quality monitoring, but also in other environmental fields.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-35503-0_4,springer

The condition monitoring of ground anchorages is a new area of research, with the long term objective being a wholly automated or semi-automated condition monitoring system capable of repeatable and accurate diagnosis of faults and anchorage post-tension levels. The gr ound an chorage i ntegrity t esting (GRANIT) system operates by applying an impulse of known force by means of an impact device that is attached to the tendon of the anchorage. The vibration signals that arise from this impulse are complex in nature and require analysis to be undertaken in order to extract information from the vibrational response signatures that is relevant to the condition of the anchorage. Novel artificial intelligence techniques are used in order to learn the complicated relationship that exists between an anchorage and its response to an impulse. The system has a worldwide patent and is currently licensed commercially. A lumped parameter dynamic model has been developed which is capable of describing the general frequency relationship with increasing post-tension level as exhibited by the signals captured from real anchorages. The normal procedure with the system is to train a neural network on data that has been taken from an anchorage over a range of post-tension levels. Further data is needed in order to test the neural network. This process can be time consuming, and the lumped parameter dynamic model has the potential of producing data that could be used for training purposes, thereby reducing the amount of time needed on site, and reducing the overall cost of the system's operation. This paper presents data that has been produced by the lumped parameter dynamic model and compares it with data from a real anchorage. Noise is added to the results produced by the lumped parameter dynamic model in order to match more closely the experimental data. A neural network is trained on the data produced by the model, and the results of diagnosis of real data are presented. Problems are encountered with the diagnosis of the neural network with experimental data, and a new method for the training of the neural network is explored. The improved results of the neural network trained on data produced by the lumped parameter dynamic model to experimental data are shown.
