In such critical situation, it becomes imperative to take data driven decisions. User generated content over online social media is an untapped data source that can be leveraged to gain insights for effective governance and decision making; and can also serve as a first hand communication medium between the various government bodies and citizens. In this paper, we have proposed a novel governance framework that leverages user generated content on social media for effective decision making by the authorities. We have used topic modelling techniques to discover social-economic trends, and to understand the issues or concerns of public interest. We used information extraction techniques like noun and verb phrase extraction, and Named Entity Recognition to measure the geographical spread, identify Covid-19 hotspots, assist in contact tracing, and discovering new health conditions. From the available literature, we could not find any intelligent framework for effective governance during pandemics, where user generated content has been utilized for real time decision making. In this paper, we address this real world problem through our proposed decision support System, and demonstrate as a proof-of-concept of how it can be used for effective governance during the pandemics through its prototype implementation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3346-1_35,springer

The idea of community detection is closely related to the concept of data clustering in pattern recognition. Data clustering refers to the task of grouping similar objects and segregating dissimilar objects. The community detection problem can be thought of as finding groups of densely interconnected nodes with few connections to nodes outside the group. A node similarity measure is proposed here that finds the similarity between two nodes by considering both neighbors and non-neighbors of these two nodes. Subsequently, a method is introduced for identifying communities in complex networks using this node similarity measure and the notion of data clustering. The significant characteristic of the proposed method is that it does not need any prior knowledge about the actual communities of a network. Extensive experiments on several real world and artificial networks with known ground-truth communities are reported. The proposed method is compared with various state of the art community detection algorithms by using several criteria, viz. normalized mutual information, f-measure etc. Moreover, it has been successfully applied in improving the effectiveness of a recommender system which is rapidly becoming a crucial tool in e-commerce applications. The empirical results suggest that the proposed technique has the potential to improve the performance of a recommender system and hence it may be useful for other e-commerce applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10660-019-09395-y,springer

They should be tackled in a fast, precise, and with an early detection goal. In recent years, social media has become popular, turning its users into proper “citizen sensors,” which means a person who, through devices, records incidents on these platforms. Therefore, they become real-time communicators of emergency events. This paper presents a preliminary study based on supervised learning toward social media emergency events detection. This approach has four phases: the first two correspond to data acquisition and preprocessing, where tweets available in a public repository about emergency and non-emergency were taken, filtered, and converted through a process of lemma feature extraction. In the third phase, four most commonly used supervised algorithms were implemented to detect tweets containing emergency events. Finally, using validation metrics and algorithms to detect emergency and non-emergency reported in the tweets was verified. Computational results showed that all evaluated algorithms achieved average rates of 85.38% of accuracy meanwhile that in execution time about 23 seconds, to detect a real emergency event.

In agri-food industrial systems, an artificial intelligent system would drive a system towards the set objectives based on the information and knowledge gathered from the consumers, farmers, machines, and domain experts. Machine learning (ML) is the preferred tool to process the knowledge and information for identifying some underlying rules and patterns to support the implementation of the AI based solution. ML-based AI is preferred, because the heterogeneity in consumer preference, biological variability of material characteristics, and unpredictable system behavior presents a highly complex system to be handled by the rule based expert systems. This chapter gives an insight of the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning with the emphasis on their application for AI implementation in the field of agri-food material handling. Popular ML algorithms viz., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are discussed as feature description methods for classification and recognition, based on the product images.

This fact enables organizations and institutions to more easily access their audiences across the globe. Some of them use social bots as an automatic entity to gain intangible access and influence on their users by faster content propagation. Thereby, malicious social bots are populating more and more to fool humans with their unrealistic behavior and content. Hence, that’s necessary to distinguish these fake social accounts from real ones. Multiple approaches have been investigated in the literature to answer this problem. Statistical machine learning methods are one of them focusing on handcrafted features to represent characteristics of social bots. Although they reached successful results in some cases, they relied on the bot’s behavior and failed in the behavioral change patterns of bots. On the other hands, more advanced deep neural network-based methods aim to overcome this limitation. Generative adversarial network (GAN) as new technology from this domain is a semi-supervised method that demonstrates to extract the behavioral pattern of the data. In this work, we use GAN to leak more information of bot samples for state-of-the-art textual bot detection method ( Contextual LSTM ). Although GAN augments low labeled data, original textual GAN ( Sequence Generative Adversarial Net (SeqGAN) ) has the known limitation of convergence. In this paper, we invested this limitation and customized the GAN idea in a new framework called GANBOT , in which the generator and classifier connect by an LSTM layer as a shared channel between them. Our experimental results on a bench-marked dataset of Twitter social bot show our proposed framework outperforms the existing contextual LSTM method by increasing bot detection probabilities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13278-021-00800-9,springer

Specific constraints for hyperelastic materials are introduced, which include energy conservation, normalization and material symmetries. We show, that the introduced enhancements lead to better learning behavior with respect to well known issues like a small number of training samples or noisy data. The NN is used as a material law within a finite element analysis and its convergence behavior is discussed with regard to the newly introduced training enhancements.

Also, explainability of a model is of prime necessity to understand the influence of multiple factors on transmission rate. Thus, we modified discrete global susceptible–infected–removed model with time-varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a region in USA for a 10-day prediction period. Comparison with current state of the art methods reveals performance superiority of the proposed method. A perturbation-based spatio-temporal model interpretation method is proposed which generates spatio-temporal local interpretations. Global interpretations are generated by statistically accumulating the local interpretations. Global interpretations of transmission rate for a region in USA shows consistent positive influence of population density, whereas, temperature and humidity have very minor influence. An experiment with what-if scenario reveals locality specific quick identification of positive cases, rapid isolation and improving healthcare facilities are keys to rapid convergence to disease-free equilibrium.

Although the latest research on KT is excellent to model behavior changes, the increasingly complex knowledge components and semantic relationships of new exercises have made courses sparse and difficult to adequately diagnose knowledge mastery. Hence, it is not enough to satisfy only the personalized learning. This paper proposes a graph-based method with multi-hierarchical network (Caps-HAGKT) for tracking capsule knowledge, which integrates rich structural information of the knowledge space, including multiple skills, prerequisites, attribution, and conceptual meta-paths. Firstly, we use the multi-hierarchical knowledge capsule network to track a variety of high-level knowledge concepts, and then extract the latent knowledge structure between levels. In addition, we adopt a new graph network with an external memory matrix to model the relationship between concept capsules at the same level and update concept states. In previous works, it was difficult to use complex graph information without any expert pre-definition. In Caps-HAGKT, the semantic attention of knowledge capsules is used to merge different semantics in knowledge according to their importance. Extensive experiments on some real-world datasets show that the prediction performance of Caps-HAGKT is better than that of the existing KT method (AUC is increased by 3.05% on an average). The visualization of both latent graphs and case studies indicates the excellent interpretability of predictions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10489-021-02765-w,springer

These characteristics attract spammers to spread spam which may cause annoyance, financial loss, or personal information loss to the user and also weaken the reputation of social network sites. Most of the spam detection methods are based on user and content-based features using machine learning techniques. But, these annotated features are difficult to extract in real-time due to the privacy policy of most social network sites. Even for the features that can be extracted, because of their large size, the manual extraction process is complex and time-consuming. So there is a need for text level spam detection that does not require extraction of hard-core features. Existing deep learning based or existing single attention mechanism based text classification methods could not perform well as social network data are sparse with short texts and noises. Moreover, Spammers avoid direct spam words and use indirect words to evade spam filtering techniques and thus resulting in the dynamic and non-stationary nature of the social network spam texts. These indirect words contain hidden context that creates attention drift problem. So conjoint attention mechanism along with two attention mechanisms namely normal attention and context preserving attention are proposed to avoid attention drift problem in this deep learning-based text level spam detection technique (TextSpamDetector). Attention drift problem is solved by one attention mechanism which helps to find the important words while another attention mechanism allows focusing on attention in target context by referring to higher level abstraction of context vector. These attention mechanisms are referring to different context representations of the input text for finding informative words from the structural context representation. This structural context representation containing both local semantic features as well as global semantic dependency features is generated by CNN and BiLSTM. The proposed model is evaluated with the existing spam detection techniques using three datasets and the experimental results have proved that the proposed model performs well in terms of accuracy, F measure, and false-positive rate.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12652-020-02640-5,springer

Traditional CF-based methods suffer from issues of data sparsity and cold start. Therefore, side information has been widely utilized by researchers to address these problems. Most side information is typically heterogeneous and in the form of the graph structure. In this work, we propose a deep end-to-end recommendation framework named GSIRec to make full use of the graph side information. Specifically, GSIRec derives a multi-task learning approach that introduces a side information task to assist the recommendation task. The key idea is that we design a delicate knowledge assistance module to be the bridge between tasks, which captures useful knowledge to complement each task. Also, we utilize a graph attention method to exploit the topological structure of side information to enhance recommendation. To show the wide application and flexibility of our framework, we integrate side information from two aspects: social networks (for users) and knowledge graphs (for items). We apply GSIRec in two recommendation scenarios: social-aware recommendation and knowledge-aware recommendation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments with four real-world public datasets. The results reveal that GSIRec consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the rating prediction task and top-K recommendation task.

Subsequently, the tweets showcasing the flood condition were determined to generate a point map and a point density map to identify the flood hotspots. We verified our results with openly available 2015 Chennai flood map that is generated using remote sensing images and found positive outcome.

However, various monitoring system criteria, such as near-real-time capabilities or applicability for different disaster types and use cases, have not yet been addressed. This paper presents an improved version of a recently proposed methodology to identify disaster-impacted areas (hot spots and cold spots) by combining semantic and geospatial machine learning methods. The process of identifying impacted areas is automated using semi-supervised topic models for various kinds of natural disasters. We validated the portability of our approach through experiments with multiple natural disasters and disaster types with differing characteristics, whereby one use case served to prove the near-real-time capability of our approach. We demonstrated the validity of the produced information by comparing the results with official authority datasets provided by the United States Geological Survey and the National Hurricane Centre. The validation shows that our approach produces reliable results that match the official authority datasets.

However, this approach cannot be easily applied to tangible structures, such as plastic composites and fabrics, because of their high structural complexity. Here, we propose a deep learning computational framework that can implement virtual experiments on tangible structures. Structural representations of complex carbon nanotube films were conducted by multiple generative adversarial networks of scanning electron microscope images at four levels of magnifications, enabling a deep learning prediction of multiple properties such as electrical conductivity and surface area. 1716 virtual experiments were completed within an hour, a task that would take years for real experiments. The data can be used as a versatile database for material science, in analogy to databases of molecules and solids used in cheminformatics. Useful examples are the investigation of correlations between electrical conductivity, specific surface area, wall number phase diagrams, economic performance, and inversely designed supercapacitors. Artificial intelligence may significantly accelerate the discovery of new materials but is not easily applicable to non-periodic structures. Here, a deep learning framework is proposed to predict properties of tangible carbon nanotubes by generating virtual structures at different scales and compositions.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-021-00195-2,springer

My claim is that the standard definition of the “artificial” is no longer useful to describe some present-day artificial sciences, as the boundary between the natural and the artificial is not so sharp and clear-cut as it was in the past. Artificial intelligence and synthetic biology, two disciplines with new technologies, new experimental methods, and new theoretical frameworks, all need a new, more specific, and refined definition of (the) “artificial”, which is also related to the use of the synthetic method to build real world entities and in open-ended (real or virtual) environments. The necessity of a new definition of the artificial is due to the close relationship of AI and synthetic biology with biology itself. They both are engineering sciences that are moving closer and closer, at least apparently, towards (natural) biology, although from different and opposite directions. I show how the new concept of the artificial is, therefore, the result of a new view on biology from an engineering and synthetic point of view, where the boundary between the natural and the artificial is far more blurred. From this, I try to formulate a brand-new, more useful definition for future understanding, practical, and epistemological purposes of these two artificial sciences.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10699-021-09799-w,springer

Unfortunately, accurate analysis of the underlying data can be difficult, even for domain experts, complicating the training of the models intended to drive experiments. This is especially true when the goal is to identify the presence of weak signatures in diffraction or spectroscopic datasets. In this work, we examine a set of as-obtained diffraction data that track the phase transition from monoclinic to tetragonal in a Nb-doped VO_2 film as a function of temperature and dopant concentration. We then task a set of domain experts and a set of machine learning experts with identifying which phase is present in each diffraction pattern manually and algorithmically, respectively; in both cases, the labels can vary dramatically, especially at the phase boundaries. We use the mode of the labels and the Shannon entropy as a method to capture, preserve and propagate consensus labels and their variance. Further we use the expert labels as a benchmark and demonstrate the use of Shannon entropy weighted scoring to test the performance of machine learning generated labels. Finally, we propose a material data challenge centered around generating improved labeling algorithms. This real-world dataset curated with expert labels can act as test bed for new algorithms.

In order to make up for this defect, we then mine useful information from attribute information, learning more informative node representation. In this paper, we explore attribute learning and mutual utilization, complementation and inspiration between social data and rating data. We propose a generic Attribute-Aware Multi-task Recommendation framework (AAMR) for rating prediction and social prediction, which learns representations for users and items by preserving both rating data and social data and attribute information, so as to conduct both rating prediction and trust relationship prediction tasks. Because many users are both in the rating matrix and in social networks, in the common learning, the two tasks will share the embedding of users, which makes the social data and rating data enrich each other’s semantics and alleviate each other’s sparsity.

Hence, the identification of genes with the underlying circadian rhythmic features is pivotal. Though computational methods have been developed for the identification of circadian genes, all these methods are based on gene expression datasets. In other words, we failed to search any sequence-based model, and that motivated us to deploy the present computational method to identify the proteins encoded by the circadian genes. Results Support vector machine (SVM) with seven kernels, i.e., linear, polynomial, radial, sigmoid, hyperbolic, Bessel and Laplace was utilized for prediction by employing compositional, transitional and physico-chemical features. Higher accuracy of 62.48% was achieved with the Laplace kernel, following the fivefold cross- validation approach. The developed model further secured 62.96% accuracy with an independent dataset. The SVM also outperformed other state-of-art machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost, XGBoost and LASSO. We also performed proteome-wide identification of circadian proteins in two cereal crops namely, Oryza sativa and Sorghum bicolor , followed by the functional annotation of the predicted circadian proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational method to identify the circadian genes with the sequence data. Based on the proposed method, we have developed an R-package PredCRG ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PredCRG/index.html ) for the scientific community for proteome-wide identification of circadian genes.

To compensate for this, some governments show an interest in teaching it from an early age. It appears that educational resources related to AI literacy in schools are most often focused on technical skills. However, the challenges of such education are also ethical and societal, requiring an interdisciplinary and critical approach. This research aims at developing a 10–14 years old curriculum questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and crossing computer science education and media literacy education. Through a role-playing game, the children discover the basic concepts of machine learning. Beyond their initial representations, which they become aware that they are largely fueled by the media, they can realize that an AI system is the result of design choices and that it only works within the framework that has been defined for it. Moreover, the possibility for teachers to teach the curriculum themselves in their classes is also evaluated. To this end, the curriculum was taught to 60 future trainee teachers, 70 middle school pupils, and 12 elementary pupils. Interviews were conducted also with 5 teachers who had either observed the curriculum taught by a researcher or attempted to teach it themselves. The results show that the children’s representations have evolved towards representations that are more technically correct (although incomplete), but not very oriented towards aspects that open up critical questioning. The difficulties revealed in the implementation of the critical part are due in particular to the complexity of the IT concepts to be addressed, but also to the lack of teacher training. However, the data collected seems to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address certain aspects of AI. In conclusion, in addition to the curriculum, this paper describes a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education and media literacy education, and gives avenues for other designers and researchers to create AI critical educational experiences for K-12 learners.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13218-021-00733-7,springer

Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance. Our results demonstrate that both anthropomorphism as well as the need to stay consistent significantly increase the likelihood that users comply with a chatbot’s request for service feedback.

In this paper, we developed a system called EAGR for emotion, age, and gender recognition, which can perceive user’s emotion, age and gender based on the face detection. The EAGR system first applies normalized facial cropping (NFC) as a preprocessing method for training data before data augmentation, then uses convolution neural network (CNN) as three training models for recognizing seven emotions (six basics plus one neutral emotion), four age groups, and two genders. For better emotion recognition, the NFC will extract facial features without hair retained. On the other hand, the NFC will extract facial features with hair retained for better age and gender recognition. The experiments were conducted on these three training models of emotion, age and gender recognitions. The recognition performance results from the testing dataset, which has been normalized for tilted head by proposed binocular line angle correction (BLAC), showed that the optimal mean accuracy rates of real-time recognition for seven emotions, four age groups and two genders were 82.4%, 74.95%, and 96.65% respectively. Furthermore, the training time can be substantially reduced via NFC preprocessing. Therefore, we believe that EAGR system is cost-effective in recognizing human emotions, ages, and genders.

A garnishment is a legal procedure by which a creditor can collect what a debtor owes by requiring to confiscate a debtor’s property (e.g., a checking account) that is hold by a third party, dubbed garnishee. Our proposal, motivated by a real-world use case, is a versatile natural-language-processing pipeline to support a garnishee in the processing of a large-scale flow of garnishment documents.

OM’s motto is the reality of the world and the human body, a subtle understanding of the mind, emotions, thoughts, and beliefs in our lives. According to Indian philosophy, OM is a spiritual symbol called Atman Brahman (Reality, World, Truth, God, Supreme Spirit, Cosmic Principles, and Knowledge). This research has the symbol of global OM. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Gayatri Mantra recitation and Om recitation on human health. Gayatri mantra is a highly potential mantra, which is mentioned in Rig Veda. The study/Yagyopathy Experiment was performed on some patients (Male = 4) and (Females = 7) with an age range of 44–70 years. All patients were trained for reciting Gayatri mantra for 3 days. The baseline data were used. The participants participated in Gayatri mantra and Om recitation about 15 min for two consecutive days. The sequence of the session was assigned randomly to the participants. This preliminary study shows that both Gayatri mantras and sitting comfort have led to increased attention, as measured by the stroop task. However, Gayatri’s mantra effect was significantly greater than Om’s recitation. During the meeting on yagyopathy chaired by Shraddhey Dr. Sahab at Shantikunj on 23 Nov 18, Prof. Rohit Rastogi volunteered to experiment its effects on himself. I consulted Dr. Vandana Srivastava and was advised following treatment: yagyopathy twice a day, at sunrise and sunset, with havan samagri for asthma and normal samagri in 3:1 ratio, recitation of Surya Gayatri mantra 24 times and nadi-shodhan pranayama for 30 min. Kwath of mixed hawan samagri twice a day. In order to measure the efficacy of Yagyopathy, I undertook Lung Function Test (LFT) on 18 Dec 18 and started yagyopathy as above instructions (once a day) since 24 Dec 18. Following, three important parameters are measured during LFT: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): a measure of lung capacity/volume of air can open after Deep inhalation. Forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV1): Breath measurement. FEV1/FVC: The ratio of lung size (FVC) that expires in seconds. The results obtained after undertaking yagyopathy treatment once a day for approximately 2 1/2 months indicated considerable improvement in lung function parameters. Results can be further improved with increasing treatment doses to twice a day.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-46197-3_20,springer

Rahimi introduces the first with: a story of a mentally disturbed man as a kind of midrash (often a story mode of biblical or qur’anic interpretation); the second with the analogy of justice as a slingshot around a black hole; and the third with an invocation of emergent cyberworlds and virtual reality as new forms of power relations depending less on information than on data and simulacra. Hauntology itself is the undoing of all ontology, all singularities, all claims to singular origins; of singular sovereignties, of the unified self, and of European philosophy as a restricted language game. Behind every claim of “how things are” lie shadows, ghosts, temporary suppressions of alternatives and contestations in the rich possibilities of life, history, politics, justice, and desire. The first horizon, of psychoanalysis before 1970, is evoked in the rich metaphorical languages drawn from Genesis, the Qur’an, the poetry of Hafiz, and the seventeenth-century Golem at the dawn of the scientific revolution. The horizon of the 1970s is evoked through electronic music and sampling in popular music, playing upon the sonic (blue note) difference between ontology and hauntology. The music scene in England in particular, beginning with the Thatcher-Reagan era articulated a sense that the past as cultural resource was nearing exhaustion, that all past senses of the future were being foreclosed, and that the new digital worlds threatened to be subject to neoliberal manipulation as datafication and gamification became tools of replacing the welfare state and social democracy. The emergent third horizon of contemporary cyberworlds is one of contending with “operational images” (legible to machines more than to humans), “modeling,” and self-generating digital and biological networks, over which we need to take control choreographically, to produce decolonial pluri-worlds and what Andean nations (among other places) are producing under the banners of, in Quechua, sumak kawsay (Spanish, buen Vivir; English: good or beautiful life). These are not mere slogans but have brought an indigenous president to power in Bolivia, changed the terms of politics in Peru, and are being struggled over in decentralized health care in Columbia, as well as municipal experiments in Barcelona. All are struggles in process, all are haunted by pasts.

Assessing the veracity of a social media message (e.g., by fact checkers) is a very time-consuming task that can be much helped by machine learning. In the literature, most message veracity verification methods only exploit textual contents and metadata. Very few take both textual and visual contents, and more particularly images, into account.

Time-based mini-batch is a novel input form to handle dynamic graphs efficiently. Using this input, we reduce the graph convolution computation only once per mini-batch. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our model performs comparable results against baseline models. Moreover, our model learns about 5.97 times faster than DyHGCN.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-65351-4_5,springer

However, POI recommendation is a challenging task since complex sequential patterns and rich contexts are contained in extremely sparse user check-in data. Recent studies show that embedding techniques effectively incorporate POI contextual information to alleviate the data sparsity issue, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been successfully employed for sequential prediction. Nevertheless, existing POI recommendation approaches are still limited in capturing user personalized preference due to separate embedding learning or network modeling. To this end, we propose a novel unified spatio-temporal neural network framework, named PPR, which leverages users’ check-in records and social ties to recommend personalized POIs for querying users by joint embedding and sequential modeling. Specifically, PPR first learns user and POI representations by joint modeling User-POI relation, sequential patterns, geographical influence, and social ties in a heterogeneous graph, and then models user personalized sequential patterns using the designed spatio-temporal neural network based on LSTM model for the personalized POI recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for successive POI recommendation in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and NDCG.

Moreover, the serialized form is insufficient to analog user complex POI moving behaviors. In this paper, we model user check-in records as a graph, named Spatial-Temporal Mobility Graph (STMG), where the nodes and edges fuse the spatial-temporal information in absolute and relative aspect respectively. Based on STMG, we propose a location prediction model named S patial-temporal E nhanced G raph Neural N etwork (SEGN).

The survivors may have gained new strength to continue life, but some of them may begin to deal with complicated feelings and emotional stress due to trauma and fear of cancer recurrence. The widespread use of Twitter for socializing has been the alternative medium for data collection compared to traditional studies of mental health, which primarily depend on information taken from medical staff with their consent. These social media data, to a certain extent, reflect the users’ psychological state. However, Twitter also contains a mix of noisy and genuine tweets. The process of manually identifying genuine tweets is expensive and time-consuming. Methods We stream the data using cancer as a keyword to filter the tweets with cancer-free and use post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related keywords to reduce the time spent on the annotation task. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learns the representations of the input to identify cancer survivors with PTSD. Results The results present that the proposed CNN can effectively identify cancer survivors with PTSD. The experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the baselines and correctly classifies the new tweets. Conclusions PTSD is one of the severe anxiety disorders that could affect individuals who are exposed to traumatic events, including cancer. Cancer survivors are at risk of short-term or long-term effects on physical and psycho-social well-being. Therefore, the evaluation and treatment of PTSD are essential parts of cancer survivorship care.

This research responds to a question that belongs to the world of the social. How to communicate for a society that urgently needs to implement sustainability strategies in the fashion sector, based on artificial intelligence at the service of rescuing the human? In this sense, based on a projective documentary research and a series of in-depth interviews with fashion experts, it allowed us to initiate what aims to lay the foundations of a prosocial communication model in the fashion sector, based on the sustainability of the human being on the planet and, as a corollary, also based on artificial intelligence. The prosocial field is oriented to collaborate and help other people in a positive, productive and social way. Artificial intelligence in fashion, at the service of sustainability and communication, allows us to think with a humanistic approach to communication, where the focus is to understand the human being in a deep way, with an interrelation with artificial intelligence and the increase of sustainability in fashion in different areas of the value chain.

However, the online microblog text stream is unstructured and unbalanced obviously. Given the big, real-time, and noisy flood disaster microblog text flow, a new regional emergency situation awareness model to automatic assess flood disaster risk is proposed. Firstly, according to the established online disaster event-meta frame, a multi-label classification algorithm for the flood microbloggings is constructed based on the historical dataset. This algorithm helps to assign the relevant event-meta tags to each situation microbloggings. Second, a new machine learning method for dynamic assessment of flood risk for online microbloggings is developed. The flood event-metas are considered to be feature vectors, and the four different levels of flood risk are considered to be four classes. Then, the flood risk assessment task is innovatively transformed into a multi-classification task. By the logistic regression ordered multi-classification algorithm, the dynamic quantitative evaluation of event-meta, users and regional risks is realized. Finally, the proposed model is applied in the case of the Yuyao Flood. The results of the case study show that the Yuyao Flood’s online quantitative risk assessment results are consistent with real accumulated precipitation data, which illustrate that the proposed machine learning model could realize the bottom-up automatic disaster information collecting by processing victim user-generated content effectively.

The differential model itself describes a narrow class of objects that are similar in some properties and can give a poor forecasting result for specific real objects. Accounting measurements allows extremely well consider the individual characteristics of the simulated object without complicating the differential structure. In the proposed neural network approach, the loss function is composed so that to take into account the differential structure, boundary conditions, and measurement data. The loss function is represented as a sum, each term of which is a weighted functional. One functional is responsible for satisfying the differential structure of the model, another for boundary conditions, and a third for the quality of the description of real measurements.

Besides, spreading the massive amount of misinformation in social networks has become a global risk. Therefore, misinformation detection (MID) in social networks has gained a great deal of attention and is considered an emerging area of research interest. We find that several studies related to MID have been studied to new research problems and techniques. While important, however, the automated detection of misinformation is difficult to accomplish as it requires the advanced model to understand how related or unrelated the reported information is when compared to real information. The existing studies have mainly focused on three broad categories of misinformation: false information, fake news, and rumor detection.

To achieve this goal, we used different popular Machine Learning tools. Moreover, we integrated an easy-to-use cloud platform, called DSaaS ( Data Science as a Service ), well suited for hospital structures, where healthcare operators might not have specific competences in using programming languages but still, they do need to analyze data as a continuous process. Moreover, DSaaS allows the validation of data analysis models based on supervised Machine Learning regression and classification algorithms. Results We used DSaaS on a real antibiotic stewardship dataset to make predictions about antibiotic resistance in the Clinical Pathology Operative Unit of the Principe di Piemonte Hospital in Senigallia, Marche, Italy. Data related to a total of 1486 hospitalized patients with nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI). Sex, age, age class, ward and time period, were used to predict the onset of a MDR UTI. Machine Learning methods such as Catboost, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks were utilized to build predictive models. Among the performance evaluators, already implemented in DSaaS, we used accuracy (ACC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), area under Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PRC), F1 score, sensitivity (SEN), specificity and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Catboost exhibited the best predictive results (MCC 0.909; SEN 0.904; F1 score 0.809; AUC-PRC 0.853, AUC-ROC 0.739; ACC 0.717) with the highest value in every metric. Conclusions the predictive model built with DSaaS may serve as a useful support tool for physicians treating hospitalized patients with a high risk to acquire MDR UTIs. We obtained these results using only five easy and fast predictors accessible for each patient hospitalization. In future, DSaaS will be enriched with more features like unsupervised Machine Learning techniques, streaming data analysis, distributed calculation and big data storage and management to allow researchers to perform a complete data analysis pipeline.

New educational technologies offer vehicles for systematically exploring benefits of alternative techniques for supporting active learning. We introduce a new genre of Intelligent Science Station technology that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support children in learning science by doing science in the real world. We use this system in a randomized controlled trial that investigates whether active learning is best when it is implemented as guided deliberate practice, as constructive “hands-on” activity, or as a combination of both. Automated, reactive guidance is made possible by a specialized AI computer vision algorithm we developed to track what children are doing in the physical environment as they do experiments and discoveries with physical objects. The results support deliberate practice and indicate that having some guided discovery based on effective learning mechanism such as self-explanation, contrasting cases and personalized interactive feedback produces more robust learning compared to exploratory construction alone. Children learning through guided discovery achieve greater understanding of the scientific principles than children learning through hands-on construction alone (4 times more pre-to-post test improvement). Importantly, a combined guided discovery and hands-on construction condition leads to better learning of the very hands-on construction skills that are the sole focus of the hands-on constructive learning condition (>10 times more pre-to-post improvement).

Specifically, here we propose a novel task assignment method to facilitate crowd assessment, which improves the security and trustworthiness of social networking platforms, as well as a task assignment algorithm based on SocialSitu, which is a social-domain-focused situational analytics. Findings from our crowd assessment experiments on a real world social network Shareteches show that the precision and recall of the proposed method and algorithm are 0.491 and 0.538 higher than those of a random algorithm’s, as well as 0.336 and 0.366 higher than users’ theme-aware algorithm’s, respectively. Moreover, these results further suggest that our experimental evaluation enhance the security and privacy of online social networks.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s13673-020-00230-0,springer

In particular, it aims to find k seeds (users) in social network G , such that the seeds can maximize the influence on users under the specific query topics and diffusion model such as independent cascade (IC) or linear threshold (LT). This problem has been proved to be NP-hard, and most of the proposed techniques suffer from the efficiency issue due to the lack of generalization. Even worse, the design of these algorithms requires significant specialized knowledge which is hard to be understood and implemented. To overcome these issues, this paper aims to learn a generalized heuristic framework to solve TIM problems by meta-learning. To this end, we first propose two topic-aware social influence propagation models based on IC and LT model, respectively, which is conducive to better advertising injections. We then encode the feature of each node by a vector and introduce a model, called deep influence evaluation model , to evaluate the user influence under different circumstances. Based on this model, we can construct the solution according to the influence evaluations efficiently, rather than spending a high cost to compute the exact influence by considering the complex graph structure. We conducted experiments on generated graph instances and real-world social networks.

However, sentiment analysis often faces insufficient labeled data in practice, as it is very expensive and time-consuming to label large amount of data. To handle the scenario of insufficient initial labeled data, we propose a novel semi-supervised model based on dynamic threshold and multi-classifiers. In particular, the training data are auto-labeled in an iterative way based on the proposed dynamic threshold algorithm, where a dynamic threshold function is proposed to set thresholds for selecting the auto-labeled data. It considers both the quality and quantity of the auto-labeled data. In addition, the proposed weighted voting strategy combines multiple support vector machine classifiers by considering performance gap among different classifiers.

Network community detection is a hot research topic in social, biological and information networks analysis. The effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is determined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth communities. In this article, we present two models to detect overlapping communities in large complex networks. In the first model, we introduce a parametrized notion of community, called k -linked community , that allows us to characterize a vertex/edge centered k -linked community with bounded diameter. Such community possesses a vertex/edge with a distance at most $$\frac{k}{2}$$ k 2 from any other vertex of that community. Next, we show how the problem of detecting vertex/edge centered k -linked communities can be expressed as a Partial Max-SAT optimization problem. Then, we propose a post-processing strategy to further enhance the overlaps between the final communities. Our second model called preference-based centroid model aims to constrain the choice of centroids communities in the first model. This new framework allows to integrate more easily the user preferences in order to discover high quality communities by selecting the most central vertices. For this, we exploit Weighted Partial Max-SAT to solve the underlying optimization problem.

To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised neural network framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques for influenza epidemiological modeling. Specifically, this framework learns social media users’ health states and intervention actions in real time, regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. The learned knowledge from social media can then be fed into the computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling.

We present a framework where these notions are mathematically conceptualized. Through the framework, we discuss the process when an individual gains social capital through building new edges. We explore two questions: (1) How would an individual optimally form new relations? (2) What are the impacts of the network structure on the individual’s social capital? For these questions, we adopt a paradigm where the individual is a utility-driven agent who acquires knowledge about the network through repeated trial-and-error.

It has been shown through recent advances in quantum cognitive science that certain aspects of human irrationality, such as cognitive biases in the Kahneman-Tversky tradition, can be explained via mathematical models borrowed from quantum physics. It has also been shown in quantum cognitive science that human rationality exhibits a special sort of non-classical phenomenon as observed in quantum physics as well, namely the phenomenon of contextuality, which extends the notion of non-locality, what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance”. In the present paper we elucidate and articulate the nature of human rationality and irrationality as observed in cognitive bias experiments and cognitive contextuality experiments. And we address the question whether non-human agents, such as animals and robots, can exhibit the same sort of cognitive biases and cognitive contextuality. Technically, we shed new light on these (quantum) cognitive experiments from the viewpoint of logic and category theory. We argue, inter alia, that the logic of cognition is substructural or monoidal, rather than Cartesian (which encompasses classical, intuitionistic, etc.), just as the logic of quantum mechanics and information is substructural or monoidal. The logic of reality is thus intertwined with the logic of cognition; the logical link between physical reality and the conscious mind would possibly allow us to go beyond the Cartesian dualism separating matter and mind as intrinsically different entities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-49183-3_14,springer

Prior research has mainly focused on machine accounts and spams separately, but characteristics of new types of spammers and spamming make it difficult for traditional methods to perform well. In this paper, we integrate the study of these new types of spammers with the study of crowdturfing microblogs, investigating the mechanism of crowdsourcing and the close relationship between crowdturfing spammers and microblogs in order to detect new types of spammers and spams more precisely. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for co-detecting crowdturfing microblogs and spammers by comprehensively modeling user behavior, message content, and users’ following and retweeting networks. In order to meet the challenge of sparsely labeled datasets, we design an elaborate co-detection target optimal function to minimize empirical error and to permit the dissemination of sparse labels to unlabeled samples. The advantage of this framework is threefold. First, through a deep-level mining of new-type spammers, we aggregate a number of new-found features that can help us make significant distinctions between normal users and new-type spammers. Secondly, by modeling both following networks and retweeting networks, we characterize the essence of the crowdsourcing mechanism abused by spammers in crowdturfing microblog diffusion to markedly increase detection performance. Thirdly, through our optimal function based on semi-supervised methods, we overcome the problem of label sparseness, thus obtaining a more reliable capacity to deal with the challenges of big, sparsely labeled data.

In our research, the analysis has been carried out and the proposed approach can be used in real practice to evaluate the implementation of program projects to boost IT readiness. For example, at the initial stage, when the project is just starting and we do not know the real values of features, we can assign to modifications the average value for each, and then when the project arrives the real value of modification, we can calculate the target and track the dynamics of the assessment, the quality of the program projects to boost IT-readiness of machine-building enterprises. Thus, an important question is the compliance of the enterprise to the necessary level of IT-readiness which is directly connected with data analysis.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-50794-7_13,springer

However, based on the information received, it is rather difficult to make any management decision, as the data are heterogeneous and their volumes are extremely large.

The size of this area usually depends on various factors such as their culture, personal traits, and acquaintanceship. The same applies to the case of human–robot interaction, especially when the robot is required to exhibit a certain level of social competence. Here, we propose a new robot navigation strategy to socially interact with people reflecting upon the social relationship between the robot and each person. To this end, we need a clear definition of interaction areas: (1) quality interaction area where people can be engaged in high-quality interactions with robots, and (2) private area not to be interfered with by the robot speech or action. A technical challenge in enhancing social human–robot interactions is how to enable robots to delineate the boundary of the two areas of each person. Specifically, the social force model (SFM) is designed by a fuzzy inference system, where the membership functions are optimized to give the robot the ability to navigate autonomously in the quality interaction area using a reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, the proposed model was verified through simulations and experiments with a real robot that can generate a suitable SFM of each person, allowing the robot to maintain the quality of interaction with each person while keeping their private personal distance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12369-019-00560-9,springer

There have been many such usages of complex systems (CSs) for artistic purposes, but deciding which parameters to use for such unpredictable systems can lead to a feeling of lack of control. For our purposes, we struggled to gain enough control over the AChem real-time image generation tool to accompany music in a video-jockeying application. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a general-purpose clustering approach that attempts to produce sets of parameter configurations which lead to maximally distinct visualisations, thus ensuring users feel that they have influence over the AChem when controlled with a suitable GUI. We present this approach and its application to controlling the development of AChems, along with the results from experiments with different clustering approaches, aided by both machine vision analysis and human curation.

The fundamental problem is how to aggregate users’ preferences over POIs (point-of-interest) to infer the users’ region-level mobility patterns. We emphasize two facts in this paper: (1) there simultaneously exists ROI-level and POI-level implicitness that blurs the users’ underlying preferences; and (2) individual POIs should have non-uniform weights and more importantly, the weights should vary across different users. To address these issues, we contribute a novel solution, namely GANR $$^2$$ (Graph Attentive Neural Network for Region Recommendation), based on the recent development of attention network and Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF). Specifically, to learn the user preferences over ROIs, we provide a principled neural network model equipped with two attention modules: the POI-level attention module, to select informative POIs of one ROI, and the ROI-level attention module, to learn the ROI preferences.

Thus, an individual’s recent behavioral patterns and corresponding machine learning rules are more likely to be interesting and significant than older ones for modeling and predicting their phone usage behavior.

This paper presents a methodology for training a learning algorithm to guide agent behaviour in a spatial ABM using a limited survey data sample. We apply different implementation strategies using survey data and Bayesian networks (BNs).

Deep learning is a core learning algorithm for autonomous control; however, it requires huge amounts of learning data, and the process of collecting various types of learning data is expensive. The collection limit of affective social videos for deep learning is resolved by analyzing affective social videos, such as YouTube and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) videos collected in advance, and generating new affective social videos more as learning data without human beings autonomously controlling other cameras.

Internet and mobile devices let us produce and consult information related to social and urban aspects. The crowd sourcing information and the social computing analyze and implement solutions to real world problems using the web content generated by social media and internet users. One of the urban factors that affect people’s activities is the vehicular traffic, every day traffic produces high stress levels and time delays when people are trying to move from one place to another using their cities highway. Vehicular traffic problems impact directly over the human’s health and over the financial dynamics of the affected cities. In the present approach, social computing is implemented by analyzing crowd sourcing information related to vehicular traffic, and computing regressions over the identified traffic events, to determine how traffic would affect an urban area at different hours. The consulted crowd sourcing information is obtained from Twitter. The traffic events forecast is implemented using a machine learning regression algorithm; the retrieved data from the social network and the regression progress results are visualized in the study area’s map, using a geographic information system. The goal of the geospatial visualization is show to the citizens the places where traffic events probably would occur, giving them the opportunity to change their routes avoiding traffic problems. One of the main characteristics of this approach is its use of volunteered geographic information.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-30809-4_27,springer

In particular, it aims to find k seeds (users) in social network G , such that the seeds can maximize the influence on users under the specific query topics . This problem has been proved to be NP-hard and most of the proposed techniques suffer from the efficiency issue due to the lack of generalization. Even worse, the design of these algorithms requires significant specialized knowledge which is hard to be understood and implemented. To overcome these issues, this paper aims to learn a generalized heuristic framework to solve TIM problems by meta-learning. To this end, we encode the feature of each node by a vector and introduce a deep learning model, called deep-influence-evaluation-model (DIEM), to evaluate users’ influence under different circumstances. Based on this model, we can construct the solution according to the influence evaluations efficiently, rather than spending a high cost to compute the exact influence by considering the complex graph structure. We conducted experiments on generated graph instances and real-world social networks. The results show the superiority in performance and comparable quality of our framework.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-26072-9_9,springer

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations. Compounding this problem, banks regard their trade data required for a full analysis as proprietary. We adapt a simulation technology combining advances in graph theory to randomly generate entire financial systems sampled from realistic distributions with a novel open-source risk engine to compute risks in financial systems under different regulations. This allows us to consistently evaluate, predict, and optimize the impact of financial regulations on all levels—from a single trade to systemic risk—before it is implemented. The resulting data set is accessible to contemporary data science techniques like data mining, anomaly detection, and visualization. We find that collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system in crisis, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-11286-8_8,springer

How to effectively recommend friend for them according to the characteristics of academic social network have become one of the current research directions. Because of traditional recommendation methods only consider the superficial interaction characteristics, it cannot obtain the more complex and diverse nonlinear relationship between the target user and the recommendation item. The method based on deep learning also has problems such as information loss. In this paper, we propose a friend recommendation model based on multi-dimensional academic characteristics and attention mechanism (MLP–AMAF). We capture the attribute features, relation features and text features of the user from academic social networking. Then we combine these academic features and get the key information related to the current recommendation task automatically by attention mechanism.

State-of-the-art research recently has focused on processing voluminous real time data in vast quantities by capturing real time sensory observations and/or social network (textual) data regarding city traffic. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using Big Data produced by Twitter textual streams for extracting traffic related events. After describing a generic yet innovative application used for data capturing, we preprocess this data so they fit into the structuring of the machine learning models for clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification (supervised learning).

For the classification case we compare various machine learning methodologies including Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, (MLP-NN), Support Vector Machines, (SVM) and a Deep Convolutional Learning, (DCL) approach to contextualize citizen observations and responses via tweets. The criteria of precision, accuracy, recall and F-score are used as statistical metrics to determine the accuracy and performance of each model.

In the paper, the vibration load of engine was obtained firstly through experiments. Secondly, the engine load was applied in the finite element model of body in white to compute the vibration velocity and realize virtual reality, indicating that the front support of the body had large vibration velocity when the frequency was lower than 60 Hz. The boundary element was then adopted to compute the interior noise and extract the sound pressure at a point near the driver’s head. Two obvious peaks were shown in sound pressure curves, at 270 and 310 Hz, respectively. The body panels that had obvious impact on the interior peak noise were determined through the panel contribution analysis, and the interior peak noise was remarkably reduced after applying sound absorption materials on these panels. Nevertheless, many more additional sound absorption materials were not always better. If a multilayer of sound absorption materials was needed, an optimal value was existed in the thickness of sound absorption material. And a great impact would be played toward the interior noise of the cabin by the reasonable selection of different sound absorption materials and their thicknesses. Finally, the neutral network (NN) was also used to predict interior noises, which was compared with the result of the boundary element. The maximum difference between the prediction values of NN and boundary element was within 5 dB, indicating that the neural network was feasible to predict the interior noise.

Information storage in molecules provides massive operation capacity for the cells. Deep understanding of mechanisms of coding and data processing in the cells could have several technology applications and trigger an industrial revolution.

Existing approaches have two main drawbacks: ( i ) they assume that the influence probabilities are independent of each other, and ( ii ) they do not consider the actions not performed by the subject (but performed by her/his friends) to learn these probabilities.

The content generated in these platforms reflect a variety of intentions, ranging from social interaction to commercial interest, among many others. The present study aims at the implementation of an automatic intent classification system for a Chilean electricity company social media account. The dataset was created from 5000 tweets that were manually classified by 5 people. If discrepancies were detected, a majority voting scheme was used in order to tag the tweets’ intentions. In order to perform the experimental validation of the automatic classification with the machine learning algorithms, several text representations were used (tf-idf, tf-rfl and bin-rfl). The results obtained from the various tests that were conducted yielded satisfactory results.

Recent events all around the globe attest to the prevalence of use of OSM sites for bringing about dramatic and drastic reforms in real world, phenomenon being referred as Cyber Activism . The real world is marred with various turmoils and people hold myriad variety of views and judgments regarding various issues. Their opinions are often poorly backed by facts. We refer to such inconclusive judgements that users generate and propagate on OSM platforms as Multi-Opinionated Content . One of the greatest challenge in such an environment is to analyze and classify such content into multiple opinion classes. In this work, we propose a generic semi-supervised classification based methodology for analyzing and classifying multi-opinionated content. We have used widely known off-the-shelf classifiers namely KNN, decision tree and random forest in our approach. To implement and validate our methodology, we have mined opinions on content in various forms, namely videos, tweets and posts on three popular social media platforms namely Youtube, Twitter and Facebook, respectively. In our validation, we have taken the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan as our case study. We have used plethora of features in building the classification model. Our experiments show that Random Forest classifier gives maximum accuracy of 90.02% and user level features give the best results.

In order to estimate the overall sentiment of a picture, it is essential to not only judge the sentiment of the visual elements but also to understand the meaning of the included text. This paper introduces an approach to estimate the overall sentiment of brand-related pictures from social media based on both visual and textual clues. In contrast to existing papers, we do not consider text accompanying a picture, but text embedded in a picture, which is more challenging since the text has to be detected and recognized first, before its sentiment can be identified. Based on visual and textual features extracted from two trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), the sentiment of a picture is identified by a machine learning classifier.

Popular hashtags that emerge from users’ activity are displayed prominently in the platform as Popular Trends .

Although logical strategies of genetic engineering have been established, protein overexpression is still an art. In particular, heterologous expression is often hindered by low level of production and frequent fail due to opaque reasons. The problem is accentuated because there is no generic solution available to enhance heterologous overexpression. For a given protein, the extent of its solubility can indicate the quality of its function. Over 30% of synthesized proteins are not soluble. In certain experimental circumstances, including temperature, expression host, etc., protein solubility is a feature eventually defined by its sequence. Until now, numerous methods based on machine learning are proposed to predict the solubility of protein merely from its amino acid sequence. In spite of the 20 years of research on the matter, no comprehensive review is available on the published methods. Results This paper presents an extensive review of the existing models to predict protein solubility in Escherichia coli recombinant protein overexpression system. The models are investigated and compared regarding the datasets used, features, feature selection methods, machine learning techniques and accuracy of prediction. A discussion on the models is provided at the end. Conclusions This study aims to investigate extensively the machine learning based methods to predict recombinant protein solubility, so as to offer a general as well as a detailed understanding for researches in the field.

Given sufficient labeled data, they often yield excellent results. However, for a variety of real-world tasks, the acquisition of sufficient labeled data can be very time-consuming; unlabeled data, on the other hand, can often be obtained easily in huge quantities. Semi-supervised support vector machines try to take advantage of these additional unlabeled patterns and have been successfully applied in this context. However, they induce a hard combinatorial optimization problem.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised leaning approach that will augment training data samples and apply a fuzzy SVM algorithm. The augmented training technique automatically extracts and enlarges training set from the unlabelled streaming text, while learning is conducted by utilising a very small training set provided as an initial input. The experimental results indicate that the proposed augmented approach outperformed all other methods, and is suitable in the real-world situations, where sufficiently labelled instances are not available for training. For the proposed fuzzy SVM approach we handle complex and multidimensional data generated by streaming text, where the importance of features are discriminated for the decision function. The evaluation conducted on different experimental scenarios indicates the superiority of the proposed fuzzy SVM against all other methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-08608-8_14,springer

Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot’s needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments.

Currently, the privacy issue of online social networks becomes a hot and dynamic research topic. Though some privacy protecting strategies are implemented, they are not stringent enough. Recently, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), which has the advantage of utilizing the unlabeled data to achieve better performance, attracts much attention from the web research community. By utilizing a large number of unlabeled data from websites, SSL can effectively infer hidden or sensitive information on the Internet. Furthermore, graph-based SSL is much more suitable for modeling real-world objects with graph characteristics, like online social networks. Thus, we propose a novel Community-based Graph (CG) SSL model that can be applied to exploit security issues in online social networks, then provide two consistent algorithms satisfying distinct needs.

Recent work has demonstrated success with statistical relational learning (SRL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) on such problems. However, both approaches rely on the availability of labeled nodes to infer the values of missing labels. When few labels are available, the performance of these approaches can degrade. In addition, many such approaches are sensitive to the specific set of nodes labeled. So, although average performance may be acceptable, the performance on a specific task may not. We explore a complimentary approach to within-network classification, based on the use of label-independent ( LI ) features – i.e., features calculated without using the values of class labels. While previous work has made some use of LI features, the effects of these features on classification performance have not been extensively studied. Here, we present an empirical study in order to better understand these effects. Through experiments on several real-world data sets, we show that the use of LI features produces classifiers that are less sensitive to specific label assignments and can lead to performance improvements of over 40% for both SRL- and SSL-based classifiers. We also examine the relative utility of individual LI features; and show that, in many cases, it is a combination of a few diverse network-based structural characteristics that is most informative.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-14929-0_1,springer

Since the dawn of humanity, along with the ability to reason came the ability to observe and interpret the physical world. It is only natural that people would observe patterns then build basic mental models to predict a future state. For instance, records indicate that there has long been a version of the adage “Red at night, sailor's delight. Red in the morning, sailors take warning.”^1 This saying is a simple predictive model based on generations of experience, and it often works. Over time people noted relationships between observations of the sky and subsequent conditions, formed this mental model, and used it to predict future behavior of the weather (Fig. 1.1). The age of enlightenment following the Renaissance brought a more modern approach to science. Careful experimentation and observation led to uncovering the physics underlying natural phenomena. For instance, a modern understanding of “Red at night, sailor's delight” is based on the theory of Mie scattering. Light rays are scattered by large dry dust particles to the west in the setting sun. According to this theory, large particles tend to scatter the longer wavelength red light forward more than they do the other frequencies of visible light. The long trajectory of the solar beams through the atmosphere when the sun is at a very low zenith angle (such as at sunset or sunrise) compounds this effect. Thus, when light rays from the setting sun are scattered by large dry dust particles associated with a high pressure system to the west, more red light reaches the observer, and the sky appears red. Since prevailing winds in the mid latitudes (where this adage is common) blow from west to east, more Mie scattering at dusk implies that a dry weather pattern is approaching. “Red in the morning, sailors take warning,” refers to a similar process at dawn when the low zenith angle in the east would produce more scattering associated with a high pressure system that has already passed, thus suggesting the possibility that a low pressure system is now approaching and wet weather may follow. This example exemplifies the types of physical explanations of observed phenomena that developed in the environmental sciences.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-9119-3_1,springer

In this paper, a revised membership function by means of supervised machine learning is introduced, in which the membership function curve is revised from the learning data of existing samples. It points that the information from supervised machine learning by samples is in the same argument to the statistic data from observation in the probability model. The formulations of supervised fuzzy machine learning by samples for revising the membership function are presented, and satisfactory results by the revised membership function compared with the experimental data are shown. It steps forward in promoting the pragmatic application of fuzzy methods in real world problems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10462-004-7189-x,springer

Neural networks,Journal of Materials Research,10.1557/jmr.2006.0076,Springer,2006-03-01,2006-03-01,"In this paper, a new method for the identification of material parameters is presented. Neural networks, which are trained on the basis of finite element simulations, are used to solve the inverse problem. The material parameters to be identified are part of a viscoplasticity model that has been formulated for finite deformations and implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. A proper multi-creep loading history was developed in a previous paper using a phenomenological model for viscoplastic spherical indentation. Now, this phenomenological model is replaced by a more realistic finite element model, which provides fast computation and numerical solutions of high accuracy at the same time. As a consequence, existing neural networks developed for the phenomenological model have been extended from a power law hardening with two material parameters to an Armstrong-Frederick hardening rule with three parameters. These are the yield stress, the initial slope of work hardening, and maximum hardening stress of the equilibrium response. In addition, elastic deformation is taken into account. The viscous part is based on a Chaboche-like overstress model, consisting of two material parameters determining velocity dependence and overstress as a function of the strain rate. The method has been verified by additional finite element simulations. Its application for various metals will be presented in Part II, [ J. Mater. Res. 21 , 677 (2006)].",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1557/jmr.2006.0076,springer

The leading application consists in the analysis of ductile cast iron specimen pictures, in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of the graphite nodules shape; to this aim the material specimen pictures are binarized. Such a binarization process can be formulated as an optimal segmentation problem. The search for the optimal solution is solved efficiently by training a neural network on a suitable set of binary templates. A robust procedure is obtained, amenable for parallel or hardware implementation, so that real-time applications can be effectively dealt with. The method was developed as the core of an expert system aimed at the unsupervised analysis of ductile cast iron mechanical properties that are influenced by the microstructure and the peculiar morphology of graphite elements.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10044-006-0052-8,springer

In the T-step, an ensemble of networks is trained with a training data set. In the O-step, ‘virtual’ data are generated in which each target pattern is determined by observing the member networks’ output for the input pattern. These virtual data are added to the training data and the two steps are repeatedly executed. The virtual data was found to play the role of a regularisation term as well as that of temporary hints having the auxiliary information regarding the target function extracted from the ensemble. From numerical experiments involving both regression and classification problems, the OLA was shown to provide better generalisation performance than simple committee, boosting and bagging approaches, when insufficient and noisy training data are given. We examined the characteristics of the OLA in terms of ensemble diversity and robustness to noise variance. The OLA was found to balance between ensemble diversity and the average error of individual networks, and to be robust to the variance of noise distribution. Also, OLA was applied to five real world problems from the UCI repository, and its performance was compared with bagging and boosting methods.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s100440200014,springer

In particular, I argue that standard notions of computation together with a ‘state-to-state correspondence view of implementation’ cannot overcome difficulties posed by Putnam's Realization Theorem and that, therefore, a different approach to implementation is required. The notion ‘realization of a function’, developed out of physical theories, is then introduced as a replacement for the notional pair ‘computation-implementation’. After gradual refinement, taking practical constraints into account, this notion gives rise to the notion ‘digital system’ which singles out physical systems that could be actually used, and possibly even built.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008364332419,springer
Article,doi:10.1023/A:1008919013557,Intelligent scheduling and control of rail-guided vehicles and load/unload operations in a flexible manufacturing system,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,10.1023/A:1008919013557,Springer,1999-11-01,"This paper presents a framework of intelligent manufacturing scheduling and control with specific applications to operations of rail-guided vehicle systems (RGVS). A RGVS control architecture is discussed with a focus on a simulated experiment in operations of the load/unload area of a real industrial flexible manufacturing system (FMS). In the operation stage of a material handling system (MHS), all shop floor data are subject to change as time goes. These data can be collected using a data acquisition device and stored in a dynamic database. The RGVS simulator used in this experimental study is designed to incorporate some possible situations representing existing material handling scenarios in order to evaluate alternative control policies. At the development stage of the controller, all possible combinations of most commonly encountered scenarios such as RGV failures, production schedule changes, machine breakdowns, and rush orders are to be simulated and corresponding results collected. The data are then structured into training data pairs to properly train an artificial neural network. The neural network, trained by using input/output data sets obtained from a number of simulation runs, will then provide control strategy recommendations. At the application stage, whenever an abnormal scenario occurs, a pre-processor will be activated to pre-screen and prepare an input vector for the trained neural network. If such an abnormal scenario falls outside the existing domain of data sets employed to train the neural network, as judged by the MHS supervisory controller, an off-line training module will be activated to eventually update the neural network. The recommended control strategies will be transmitted to the MHS control for real-time execution. If there is no further abnormal event detected, the dynamic data base (DDB) module simply continues to monitor the MHS activities. The proposed MHS control system combines the features of example based neural network technology and simulation modeling for true intelligent, on-line, pseudo real-time control. Not only will the system assure that feasible material handling control actions be taken, but also it will implement better control decisions through continuous learning from experiences captured as the operation time of the MHS accumulates.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008919013557,springer
