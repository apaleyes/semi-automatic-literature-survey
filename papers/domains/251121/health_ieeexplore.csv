A steadily increasing trend of obesity is not only limited to developed countries, but to developing nations as well. As smartphones have rapidly gained mainstream popularity, mobile applications (apps) are used in public health as intervention to keep track of diets, activity as well as weight, which is deemed more accurate than relying on user's self-report measure, for the sake of weight management. A solution called “Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System” (SWITCHes) is developed to facilitate objective data reception and transmission in a real-time manner. Based on the user data acquired from SWITCHes app and the auxiliary data from medical instruments, not only SWITCHes app can engage user with tailored feedback in an interactive way, in terms of artificial intelligence-powered health chatbot, but the healthcare professional can provide the more accurate medical advice to user also.

Automation and digitalization of marine vessels involve smart digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect ships' health data and send it over to a central processing location where this data is analyzed. However, it is difficult to apply this to the shipping industry due to offshore data transmission bandwidth challenges.

For machine health monitoring systems (MHMS), the major efforts have been put in designing and deploying more and more complex machine learning models which are also called as black-box models considering they are non-transparent towards their working mechanism. However, this research trend brings huge potential risk in real life. Since machine health monitoring itself is a high-stake decision scenario, the decision of the autonomous monitoring system should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: Why the deployed MHMS predict what they predict. In this paper, we shed some lights on this meaningful research direction: explainable machine health monitoring systems (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can only make diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named as DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), balances precision-explainability trade-off. Specifically, features and temporal information will be encoded in different stages of our model.

10.1109/TSP.2019.8768883,Edge-AI in LoRa-based Health Monitoring: Fall Detection System with Fog Computing and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Remote healthcare monitoring has exponentially grown over the past decade together with the increasing penetration of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks.

Hence, building resilient CPSs is a prime need and continuous monitoring of the CPS operational health is essential for improving resilience. This paper presents a framework for calculating and monitoring of health in CPSs using data driven techniques. The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS.

Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller.

10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

10.1109/AERO.2005.1559665,Health monitoring: new techniques based on vibrations measurements and identification algorithms,IEEE,Conferences,"Purpose of the paper is to present an innovative application inside the nondestructive testing field based on vibrations measurements, developed, at the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" (Italy), by the authors during the last three years, and already tested for analysing damages of many structural elements. The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system. These techniques promise to bring a step forward for the implementation of an automatic ""health monitoring"" system which will be able to identify a structural damage in real time, improving the safety and reducing maintenance costs",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1559665/,2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference,5-12 March 2005,ieeexplore

The proposed system aims to monitor the heart rate of the passengers by using a low-cost camera, which can be readily embedded in the car's rear-view mirror. Additionally, we integrate this system with the main system of our test driverless car, and we propose how driverless cars should act in response to serious medical emergency situations. Moreover, we investigate how this system can benefit from the promising features of Google I/O and Google AI. Our approach is based on Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG), in which the heart rate is extracted from the subtle tiny changes occurring in the skin color of the face during every pulsation.

10.1109/CHASE.2016.18,Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Deep Learning and Mobile Health Technologies among Resource-Poor and Marginalized Communities,IEEE,Conferences,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease worldwide and remains a major cause of death globally. Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening. The second research activity focus on developing effective and efficient computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Our future work includes: (1) to further improve the performance of the algorithms, and (2) to deploy our system in the city of Carabayllo in Perú, a densely occupied urban community and high-burden TB.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545842/,"2016 IEEE First International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",27-29 June 2016,ieeexplore
10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2010.8851,Improving activity classification for health applications on mobile devices using active and semi-supervised learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile phones' increasing ubiquity has created many opportunities for personal context sensing. Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction. Thus, democratic co-learning would be the best choice for most applications, since it would significantly increase the accuracy for initial classifiers that performed poorly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5482296/,2010 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,22-25 March 2010,ieeexplore

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients.

The patients belong to the positive region or lower approximation set of rough set are interpreted with certain symptoms while outcome about the patients in the boundary region is uncertain. The proposed method identifies the patients in the boundary region which could be interpreted positively based on specific criteria, defined using different attribute values.

There are many challenges in mining EHRs, such as temporality, irregularity, sparsity, bias, etc. Thus effective feature extraction and representation are key steps before any further applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-task deep representation learning method (MTDRL) with the objective of extracting the valuable clinical information from raw data and learning an effective and interpretable patient representation. Firstly, MTDRL utilizes Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) as an encoder to learn the hidden state vectors which are used as inputs for the following networks. This encoding part can be seen as a shared network for all tasks. Secondly, patient's in-hospital mortality prediction and sequence reconstruction are simultaneously conducted based on the encoding network. Specifically, an attention mechanism and a fully-connected layer are incorporated in prediction task and BiGRU is implemented in the other task to reconstruct the visit sequences. Finally, we apply MTDRL to real EHRs data and the experimental results demonstrate that MTDRL is capable of learning more effective patient representation and has a significant improvement in the performance of patient's in-hospital mortality prediction.

In this paper we report on our efforts to develop a real-time, real-world pain detection system from human facial expressions. Although many studies addressed this challenge, most of them use the same dataset for training and testing. There is no cross-check with other datasets or implementation in real-time to check performance on new data. This is problematic, as evidenced in this paper, because the classifiers overtrain on dataset-specific features. This limits realtime, real-world usage.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility. Results from the network are explainable, enabling human oversight of operational decisions. Real-time implementation enables integration into avionics systems. Further, the data-driven approach to learning relationships enables this system to adapt as information concerning unmanned systems steadily changes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9256593/,2020 AIAA/IEEE 39th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),11-15 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

In this paper we test the hypothesis that the application of machine learning techniques on data of this nature can be used to address prediction/forecasting problems in the Health IT domain. The novelty of this approach consists in that medical data (test results, diagnoses, doctors' notes etc.) are not included in the predictors' dataset. Moreover, there is limited need for separation of patient cohorts based on specific health conditions. Methods: We experiment with the prediction of the probability of early readmission at the time of a patient's discharge. We extract real HIS data and perform data processing techniques. We then apply a series of machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Deep Multilayer Neural Network) and measure the performance of the emergent models. Results: All applied methods performed well above random guessing, even with minimal hyper-parameter tuning.

In this work, we develop a custom experiment and Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting POTP from biomarkers acquired from wearable biosensors. We first confirm that individuals experience time passing slower than usual during fear or sadness (p=0.046) and faster than usual during cognitive tasks (p=2×10<sup>-5</sup>).

The classifier had a weighted average F-1 score of 79%, with the fast-passing time class having the highest F-1 score of 93%. Next, we classify each individual's POTP regardless of the task at hand, achieving an F-1 score of 77.1% when distinguishing time passing faster rather than slower than usual.

Through a real-world case study, we observe that temporary disconnection between sensors and the associated smartphone can happen frequently due to postural changes, causing a significant amount of data to be lost forever. In this paper, we propose a scheme to parasitize the data in surrounding Wi-Fi networks whenever temporary disconnection occurs. Specifically, we model data parasitizing as an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the system lifetime without any data loss. Then, we propose an optimal offline algorithm to solve the problem, as well as an online algorithm that allows practical implementations. We have also implemented a prototype system, where the online algorithm serves as the underlying technique, based on Arduino.

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%).

Therefore, we present a novel model, named Attention-based Equitable Segmentation Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (AESGRU), to improve diagnostic accuracy and model-building efficiency. Specifically, our proposed AESGRU consists of two modules, an equitable segmentation approach and an improved deep model. We first transform the original dataset into time-series segments with temporal correlation, so that the model enables end-to-end learning from the strongly correlated data.

To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary.

Despite the significant increase in adoption of EHR systems, these data remain largely unexplored, but present a rich data source for knowledge discovery from patient health histories in tasks, such as understanding disease correlations and predicting health outcomes. However, the heterogeneity, sparsity, noise, and bias in these data present many complex challenges. This complexity makes it difficult to translate potentially relevant information into machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a computational framework, Patient2Vec, to learn an interpretable deep representation of longitudinal EHR data, which is personalized for each patient. To evaluate this approach, we apply it to the prediction of future hospitalizations using real EHR data and compare its predictive performance with baseline methods. Patient2Vec produces a vector space with meaningful structure, and it achieves an area under curve around 0.799, outperforming baseline methods. In the end, the learned feature importance can be visualized and interpreted at both the individual and population levels to bring clinical insights.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490816/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/JIOT.2020.3013272,Physical Activity Recognition With Statistical-Deep Fusion Model Using Multiple Sensory Data for Smart Health,IEEE,Journals,"Nowadays, enhancing the living standard with smart healthcare via the Internet of Things is one of the most critical goals of smart cities, in which artificial intelligence plays as the core technology. Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9153758/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Feb.1, 2021",ieeexplore
10.1109/TIM.2011.2169182,Prediction of Machine Health Condition Using Neuro-Fuzzy and Bayesian Algorithms,IEEE,Journals,"This paper proposes a novel approach for machine health condition prognosis based on neuro-fuzzy systems (NFSs) and Bayesian algorithms. The NFS, after training with machine condition data, is employed as a prognostic model to forecast the evolution of the machine fault state with time. An online model update scheme is developed on the basis of the probability density function (PDF) of the NFS residuals between the actual and predicted condition data. Bayesian estimation algorithms adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set of random samples (or particles) with associated weights. When new data become available, the weights of all particles are updated, and then, predictions are carried out, which form the PDF of the predicted estimations. The developed method is evaluated via two experimental cases-a cracked carrier plate and a faulty bearing. The prediction performance is compared with three prevalent machine condition predictors-recurrent neural networks, NFSs, and recurrent NFSs. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict machine conditions more accurately.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6046227/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,Feb. 2012,ieeexplore

It consists of three major stages: the PPG signal quality assessment (PPG-SQA) using autocorrelation function (ACF) and number of threshold-crossings (NTC) features, the zero-frequency resonator (ZFR) based pulse onset and peak determination, and the pulse parameter extraction. The method is implemented on the Arduino Due with a 32-bit Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, 512-kB flash memory, 96-kB SRAM, and 84-MHz clock speed. The method is evaluated on the recorded PPG signals and three standard PPG databases. The PPG-SQA algorithm achieves an average sensitivity (Se) = 98.62%, specificity (Sp) = 97.37%, and overall accuracy (OA) = 98.09%. The algorithm achieves an average Se = 99.88%, positive predictivity (Pp) = 99.89, Se = 99.82%, and Pp = 99.95%, respectively with the delineation errors (mean ± standard deviation) of 8.45 ± 9.39 ms and 0.23 ± 1.33 ms for finding onsets and peaks, respectively. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the parameter measurement errors are minimum for most of the pulse cycles. Results show that our quality-aware PPG analysis scheme can achieve a false alarm rate reduction (FARR) of 97.36% which outperforms the other existing SQA algorithms.

10.1109/JBHI.2016.2525006,Resource-Aware Mobile-Based Health Monitoring,IEEE,Journals,"Monitoring heart diseases often requires frequent measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at different periods of the day, and at different situations (e.g., traveling, and exercising). This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth.

This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the ""Big Data"" scale in order to prevent the well-known ""overfitting"" problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one of the effective ways to decrease this transmission is wearing masks in crowded places. However, monitoring people by police is a weary and difficult process. Thanks to the improvement in technology and artificial intelligence that make task became easier. In this paper, a simple mask recognition model based on texture and color moments features is proposed. This model is deployed in two stages: first, texture and color moments features from the face image (31 features) are extracted using a hybridization between texture features and color moments features techniques. In order to extract the texture features, the image transformed into Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) then 22 statistical metrics were calculated. So as to extract the color moments features, the first, second and third moments have been calculated from each layer of the RGB image. Second, based on the extracted features, the images are classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model (MLP). The dataset used in this research consists of 1787 real images with masks and 1918 without masks.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery.

PD monitoring is a promising approach that ensures the reliable performance of electrical assets through condition based maintenance. Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to discover features and specific patterns that can differentiate between partial discharges and noise. On-line PD monitoring systems have been recently deployed for continuously assessing the equipment health, so that its maintenance requires minimal cost and shorter disruption to operational services. However, labelled data is required in order to build predictive models for on-line PD monitoring. Labelled data is expensive to obtain since it requires expert input. In addition, in real scenarios the ratio of noise pulses to real PDs can be high, making the learning task harder. This paper investigates an active learning (AL) approach for streaming data that aims to maintain an on-line model that is robust to class imbalances.

Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved. Our solution is a novel, scalable and accessible tool for disease management of diverse agricultural crop plants and can be deployed as a Cloud based service for farmers and experts for ecologically sustainable crop production.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8648635/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM),23-24 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

In developing countries, majority of primary-care is handled by unqualified practitioners owing to an acute shortage of doctors. The goal of this project is to develop a portable and low-cost system that can be used by untrained frontline health-workers for early detection of valvular heart abnormalities such as arrhythmias and murmurs. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud and Mobile, we simulated stethoscope-based cardiac auscultation typically done by trained doctors. We detect abnormal heartbeat patterns by applying pre-processing algorithms such as slicing and FFT to stethoscope sounds, converting into high-quality spectrograms and classifying with state-of-the-art Cloud-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained with normal and abnormal heart sounds. The system was trained and tested with heart sound datasets from UMichigan, Pascal and PhysioNet and 95% average classification accuracy was achieved. We optimized spectrogram parameters with experimentation for higher accuracy. The infrastructure can be extended to other diseases such as pulmonary disorders that can be detected via auscultation.

10.1109/CASE48305.2020.9216773,An Enhanced Fault Diagnosis Method with Uncertainty Quantification Using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Fault diagnosis is a vital technique to pinpoint the machine malfunctions in manufacturing systems. In recent years, the deep learning techniques greatly improve the fault detection accuracy, but there still remain some problems. If one fault is absent in the training data or the fault signal is disturbed by severe noise interference, the fault classifier may misjudge the health state. This problem limits the reliability of the fault diagnosis in real applications. In this paper, we enhance the fault diagnosis method by using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN). A Shannon entropy-based method is presented to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The BCNN turns the deterministic predictions to probabilistic distributions and enhances the robustness of the fault diagnosis. The uncertainty quantification method helps to indicate the wrong predictions, detect unknown faults, and discover the strong disturbances. Then, a fine-tuning strategy is applied to enhance the model performance further. The potential usability of the proposed method in monitoring the motors of 3D printers is studied. And the experiment is conducted on a motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The proposed BCNN achieves 99.82% fault classification accuracy over nine health conditions. Its robustness is verified by comparing the testing accuracy with three other methods on the noisy datasets.

PAC-DSS (Pharmaceutical Acquisition Capability Decision Support Service) is an innovative decision support service that enables hospitals to pool together and share information to better understand current market prices and run analytics on drug prices in order to improve their operating costs. Our service allows users to interact with real pricing data to dissect various factors that can contribute to acquisition capabilities of individual drugs such as specific brand names or groups of drugs such as all brands of a given generic drug, without sacrificing individual providers' privacy as we do not disclose individual purchase prices. In developing PAC-DSS, we have had to address a range of technical challenges such as data privacy and alignment of disparate drug ontologies.

10.1109/BIOSMART.2019.8734185,An IoT-Cloud Based Solution for Real-Time and Batch Processing of Big Data: Application in Healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"With the large use of Internet of Things (IoT) today, everything around us seems to generate data. The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting. We analyze the performance of the implemented system in terms of response time by varying the velocity and volume of the analyzed data. We also discuss how the cloud resources should be provisioned in order to guarantee processing performance for both long-term and real-time scenarios.

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations.

This article first sheds light on some contextual issues that can be encountered by real-world applications, and then proposes a new method of context enhancement, called Individual Context Enrichment: ICE, to be combined with CMABs. ICE allows CMAB algorithms to rely on additional relevant context features that are computed according to the previously obtained individual accuracy of users when in given contexts which we define as user-context pairs. Basically, ICE classifies user-context pairs according to their individual accuracy, and uses the obtained classes to enrich the original context. To be effective, our method requires regular users, thus it is particularly interesting in the case of applications having identifiable subscribers e.g., recommender systems, clinical trial or mobile health.

However, wearable devices having real-time cardiac health monitoring aids individuals as well as medical professionals in the timely diagnosis of fatal heart diseases, such as arrhythmia. This paper proposes a low power VLSI architecture that facilitates the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) into normal and other seven types of arrhythmia beats using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Unlike the existing methods for heartbeat classification, in which handcrafted ECG features are utilised, the proposed design leverages DNN for the classification of arrhythmia using a complete ECG beat. This obviates the need to extract ECG features separately and, produces an accurate and power optimised design for arrhythmia classification. Evaluation of the proposed methodology on the MIT-BIH dataset exhibits the accuracy and specificity of 97.01 % and 99.09%, respectively, which is comparable or better with respect to other algorithms implemented on software or ASIC based platforms. The proposed architecture is realised at 180nm CMOS technology having 0.624mm<sup>2</sup> area and exhibits 6.82× less power consumption at 1kHz as compared to others methods.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

We deploy an additive fuzzy system into a neural network architecture in order to incorporate recurrent nodes to enable the fuzzy system to handle temporal data. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy rule structure before supervised training is applied to adjust parameters. As epidemiological time series exhibit complex behavior and possibly cyclic patterns, the addition of recurrent nodes to the fuzzy system improves the modeling capability. The proposed model dominates the benchmark feedforward neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model regarding modeling performance. Through real applications for epidemiologic time series modeling, the fusion of soft computing techniques offer accurate forecasts that have considerable meaning in planning infectious disease-control activities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707048/,The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),4-9 Aug. 2013,ieeexplore
10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934969,Exploiting sensing diversity for confident sensing in wireless sensor networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Wireless sensor networks for human health monitoring, military surveillance, and disaster warning all have stringent accuracy requirements for detecting or classifying events while maximizing system lifetime. We define meeting such user accuracy requirements as confident sensing. To perform confident sensing and reduce energy, we must address sensing diversity: sensing capability differences among heterogeneous and homogeneous sensors in a specific deployment. We are among the first to explore the impact of sensing diversity on sensor collaboration, exploit diversity for sensing confidence, and apply diversity exploitation for confident sensing coverage. We show that our diversity-exploiting confident coverage problem is NP-hard for any specific deployment and present a practical solution, Wolfpack. Through a distributed and iterative sensor collaboration approach, Wolfpack maximizes a specific deployment's capability to meet user detection requirements and save energy by powering off unneeded nodes. Using real vehicle detection trace data, we demonstrate that Wolfpack provides confident event detection coverage for 30% more detection locations, using 20% less energy than a state of the art approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5934969/,2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,10-15 April 2011,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISSREW.2018.00019,Extracting Interaction-Related Failure Indicators for Online Detection and Prediction of Content Failures,IEEE,Conferences,"With the increasing complexity of software-intensive systems, software health management is proposed to assure their runtime dependability, in which online failure detection and prediction is one of the most significant components. Failure indicators are characteristics of internal states and behavior of a system which indicate potential failures. However, previous studies mostly focused on extracting failure indicators from network and hardware outside of a software system or operating system level, neglected the runtime dynamics on application level. Besides, most of these studies aimed at detecting and predicting performance-related failures. As a major category of software failures, content failures are often omitted. This paper proposes an experiment-based approach to extract interaction-related failure indicators on application level for content failures, composed of abnormal execution time of modules and abnormal interaction times between modules. Firstly, an experiment-based failure data generation method is proposed due to a lack of real-world failure data which can reflect the runtime states and behavior of a software system. Then a machine learning method is selected and applied on the failure dataset to construct classifiers for normal data and failure data, from which failure indicators are extracted. Finally, three open-source software were selected to show the validity of our extracting method and the effectiveness of the extracted failure indicators. Interaction-related failure indicators extracted by the proposed approach can be used for runtime failure detection and prediction of content failures, thus improving runtime dependability of complex software-intensive systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8539208/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW),15-18 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

The proposed systems commonly used special devices placed at several position of user's body. On the other hand, smartphones with various sensors including gyroscopes are available in the market nowadays. This has motivated us to propose a prototype system of fall detection application designed for a smart phone. A threshold based fall detection algorithm is adapted for the proposed system since it relatively requires lower computational processes compared to complex reasoning techniques. Hence is more suitable to be implemented in smart phones with limited resource and processing power. The basic idea of the algorithm is to detect dynamic situations of posture, followed by unintentional falls to lying postures.

In the health domain, and especially for remote healthcare monitoring systems, the management of data in real time becomes a requirement. Indeed, care providers need to access the vital information and sometimes the processed data in order to take timely the adequate decision.

Most existing pill recognition models are limited in tackling this challenging few-shot learning problem due to the insufficient instances per category. With limited training data, neural network-based models have limitations in discovering most discriminating features, or going deeper. Especially, existing models fail to handle the hard samples taken under less controlled imaging conditions. In this study, a new pill image database, namely CURE, is first developed with more varied imaging conditions and instances for each pill category. Secondly, a W2-net is proposed for better pill segmentation. Thirdly, a Multi-Stream (MS) deep network that captures task-related features along with a novel two-stage training methodology are proposed. Within the proposed framework, a Batch All strategy that considers all the samples is first employed for the sub-streams, and then a Batch Hard strategy that considers only the hard samples mined in the first stage is utilized for the fusion network. By doing so, complex samples that could not be represented by one type of feature could be focused and the model could be forced to exploit other domain-related information more effectively.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data.

The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system.

Specifically, HDL uses automatic detection and then segments and processes the raw blister pack images irrespective of position, lighting variations, etc., making them suitable for CNN to classify the correct blister pack types. A ResNet CNN classifier has been trained using the processed images, and the resultant CNN model is finally deployed for classification. We have conducted an extensive experiment at the adult lozenge dispensing station of MacKay Memorial Hospital. The database that will be released along with this paper, consists of 272 types of blister packages, with 65 images belonging to each type for training and additional 7 images for validation. On real testing scenario, the proposed approach yielded almost 100% accuracy, consistently over the entire testing set. The proposed solution can also be extended to any dispensing station for automatic detection and classification of blister packages, thereby offering an highly effective and efficient delivery system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8502488/,2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA),4-7 Sept. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICAECT49130.2021.9392459,Highly Accurate Real time human Counter with Minimum Computation Cost,IEEE,Conferences,"During the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic when we need to operate any public facility like museum, shopping mall, restaurants, or public dealing organizations, we not only need to keep the operations going but also have to ensure precautionary measures to ascertain their safety. As per all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) it is advisable to restrict number of visitors inside these enclosed spaces which are most likely to be weather controlled. Automatic safety compliance thus becomes imperative in such situations. Even though absolute compliance and alert signalling will require scrutiny and cross-checking at several levels, a beginning towards automation of compliance monitoring seems mandatory in the neo-normal era. Hence In this project we have designed a low cost rapidly implementable design to monitor the number of visitors inside the self-contained hall. The system will give signal once the maximum permissible visitor population is reached at a given time. Monitoring the optimal population and the density and enforcing visitor to wear mask even within the space manually is tantamount to imposing health hazards to the person who will physically have to monitor and it may as well render the visitors vulnerable. Here we have used Artificial Intelligence based model person detection and tracking. Real time tracking with accuracy is still an important area in computer vision. There are some commercial solution available for the problem but all of them either implemented considering ideal situation or need huge cost and infrastructure. But as a part of museums community we are passing through a financial crises as due to pandemic we closed for visitors. Hence neither we can afford costly system nor a system designed with ideal condition. This motivates us to develop a new system according to our criteria. Here we have modified the available solution for implementation in real world environment using very minimum hardware infrastructure requirements to work on real time with maximum possible efficiency. This system is not only useful for COVID-19 Situation but also its use can be extended beyond the boundary of museums for visitor density monitoring system for large public establishment with minimum computation cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9392459/,"2021 International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Computing, Communication and Sustainable Technologies (ICAECT)",19-20 Feb. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISNCC49221.2020.9297188,Human Trait Analysis via Machine Learning Techniques for User Authentication,IEEE,Conferences,"Machine learning is an extremely important technique that has become heavily used in different types of applications such as detection systems for fraud, intrusion or fault and monitoring systems for health or computer. Human trait analysis and identification is a field of research that needs a strong implementation for machine learning. Human trait analysis provides a tool with which human identification factors can be verified. Currently, detail aspects of human behavior are digitally and continuously logged in Big Data based platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. This continuous flow of high-volume data requires sophisticated data analysis to examine huge amounts of behavioral evidence so that human traits can be modeled. This paper proposes an innovative technique for human trait analysis that fits the needs for user's identity verification. The pioneering work of this technique is in the distinction of the normal and abnormal actions of the users, where the focus is given to these abnormal actions to establish security potential profiles. The data analysis and prediction of the proposed technique is based on the concept of machine learning and uses several models based on four techniques; K-means, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Auto-Encoder Neural Network, and Gaussian Distribution. Experiments have been carried out in four main phases: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions. Real-world scenarios are considered to demonstrate the benefits of these challenging questions in building secure knowledge-based user authentication systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9297188/,"2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",20-22 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting. Extensive experimentations are performed on real-world IoT City Pulse Pollution dataset. The proposed model is compared with ConvLSTM in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the R-squared (R2) and is found to outperform ConvLSTM.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9071548/,2020 International Conference on Innovative Trends in Information Technology (ICITIIT),13-14 Feb. 2020,ieeexplore

Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160454/,"2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",25-29 May 2015,ieeexplore

Over the last decade, the increasing world-wide demand for early detection of breast cancer has resulted in necessity of new research avenues. The current work on the early detection of breast cancer, which mainly focus on the respective (independent) analysis of clinical document and medical images, ignoring the internal relevance internal interactions (relations) of images and reports, and has been proved to be somewhat effective in the experiment but not practical in the real world. In this paper, we propose fusion convolutional neural networks (f-CNNs) to extract and mine the semantic interactions of radiology images and reports. Our f-CNNs provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, text composition, and the matching relations between the two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN modeling the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from words based on character-level representation and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the relations between image and sentence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed f-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for image and sentence matching. More specifically, our proposed f-CNNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for disease classification on the datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622808/,2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 4th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),28-30 June 2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/CHASE.2016.18,Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Deep Learning and Mobile Health Technologies among Resource-Poor and Marginalized Communities,IEEE,Conferences,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease worldwide and remains a major cause of death globally. Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem.

10.1109/ICIT.2015.7125235,Improving accuracy of long-term prognostics of PEMFC stack to estimate remaining useful life,IEEE,Conferences,"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel cells (PEMFC) are energy systems that facilitate electrochemical reactions to create electrical energy from chemical energy of hydrogen. PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of long-term prognostics. The SW-ELM is used for ensemble modeling due to its enhanced applicability for real applications as compared to conventional data-driven algorithms. The proposed prognostics model is validated on run-to-failure data of PEMFC stack, which had the life span of 1750 hours.

10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2010.8851,Improving activity classification for health applications on mobile devices using active and semi-supervised learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile phones' increasing ubiquity has created many opportunities for personal context sensing. Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction. Thus, democratic co-learning would be the best choice for most applications, since it would significantly increase the accuracy for initial classifiers that performed poorly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5482296/,2010 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,22-25 March 2010,ieeexplore

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in occupational safety in the construction industry. However, all the current methods using conventional machine learning with stationary cameras suffer from some severe limitations, perceptual aliasing (e.g., different places/objects can appear identical), occlusion (e.g., place/object appearance changes between visits), seasonal / illumination changes, significant viewpoint changes, etc. This paper proposes a perception module using end-to-end deep-learning and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for an effective and efficient object recognition and navigation using a differential-drive mobile robot. Various deep-learning frameworks and visual navigation strategies with evaluation metrics are implemented and validated for the selection of the best model. The deep-learning model's predictions are evaluated via the metrics (model speed, accuracy, complexity, precision, recall, P-R curve, F1 score). The YOLOv3 shows the best trade-off among all algorithms, 57.9% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 45 frames per second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a right candidate for deploying the neural network on a mobile robot. The evaluation metrics used for the comparison of laser SLAM are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The Google Cartographer SLAM shows the lowest RMSE and acceptable processing time. The experimental results demonstrate that the perception module can meet the requirements of head protection criteria in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for construction.

However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian “black box” society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design. Such systems are able to self-learn lifelong, and continuously improve without the need for complete retraining, can start learning from few training data samples, explore the data space, detect and learn from unseen data patterns, collaborate with humans or other such algorithms seamlessly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9431114/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops),22-26 March 2021,ieeexplore

Extensive time series logging has been implemented to monitor the health of various infrastructure systems. CPU usage of internal services (e.g., large number of machine learning models built by different teams), network traffic between internet service providers and Facebook data centers, video streaming KPI of live broadcasts generated by daily active users, just to name a few. Many methods and tools are available to analyze the logs at single time series level, for instance, time series forecasting and (contextual) anomaly detection. Relatively little is done to address an emerging use case - identifying similar/outlier instances from a large collection of time series. In this poster, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a generic framework to accomplish such needs. We discuss two real-world implementations of the approach: (i) auto-scaling the inference capacity for machine learning (ML) models, and (ii) detect video ingestion quality outliers across Facebook live broadcasts.

We compare the results of structure learning to the expert-guided structure and use decision functions for classification using posterior probabilities.

Among many localization algorithms, range-free localization is more preferable because of its cost and implementation efficiency. Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms. Hence, simulation results clearly show that the performance of aforementioned method is better than other pioneer algorithms for such extended networks, and is insusceptible to the ratio of anchor nodes and network density.

Moreover, health monitoring has emphasized the need for edge computing to process real-time data without the bandwidth costs. However, the reconstructed analysis (RA) and the compressed learning (CL) frameworks have extremely high memory and computational overhead, cost-prohibitive for online usage at resource-constrained edge device. In this paper, to efficiently analyze the received CS measurements with different levels of compression, we propose a low-complexity framework of Compressive Analysis in Sub-Eigenspace (CA-SE) based on subspace-based representation. The dictionary is used for sifting the sub-eigen information from the CS measurements online, and it is built by eigenspace learning offline. The framework can reduce the memory overhead with a single light-weight machine learning model and multiple small filter matrices, and the computational complexity with sifting by matrix-vector product rather than sparse coding. CA-SE is implemented in ECG-based atrial fibrillation detection. The memory overhead of CA-SE is 13 and 39 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively, and the computational complexity of CA-SE is 42 and 10 times fewer compared with RA and CL, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682766/,"ICASSP 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",12-17 May 2019,ieeexplore

Most of the hospital in Bangladesh lack serving proper health service due to unavailability of appropriate, easy and scalable smart systems. The aim of this project is to build an adequate system for hospitals to serve critical patients with a real-time feedback method. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture, associated terminology and a classificatory model for observing critical patient's health condition with machine learning and IBM cloud computing as Platform as a service (PaaS). Machine Learning (ML) based health prediction of the patients is the key concept of this research. IBM Cloud, IBM Watson studio is the platform for this research to store and maintain our data and ml models. For our ml models, we have chosen the following Base Predictors: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and MLP Classifier. For improving the accuracy of the model, the bagging method of ensemble learning has been used. The following algorithms are used for ensemble learning: Bagging Random Forest, Bagging Extra Trees, Bagging KNeighbors, Bagging SVC, and Bagging Ridge.

Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients. The paper proposes a learning method to managing uncertainty in health data using rough set theory and other relevant attributes like location, time, age etc., which improves primary care to the patients of rural India. The patients belong to the positive region or lower approximation set of rough set are interpreted with certain symptoms while outcome about the patients in the boundary region is uncertain.

Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data. Based on the assumption that anomaly deviates from normal data, the time periods with large prediction error can be recognized as faults.

VPs allow for safe and supportive experiences for health sciences students to practice problem solving and diagnostic skills without endangering real patients. Our previous work investigated the feasibility of procedurally generating virtual patient cases that leverage Bayesian network (BN) models learned from EMR data to present clinical scenarios and control outcomes of learners' decisions within the context of a presented VP. In this paper, we describe an experiment that compares a VP case based on a BN model to one created using a traditional narrative-branched VP system across multiple categories. Our results show that the narrative-branched VP case was rated significantly higher than its BN-based counterpart on reflecting the learning objectives, introducing/reinforcing clinical skills, attitudes, and behaviors relevant to sepsis treatment, providing formative feedback for choices/outcomes, and being more effective in teaching the subject matter to novice clinical practitioners.

In a real time warfare game, coordination of NPC troops can create a deeper sense of immersion. Anyhow, multi behavior NPC troops have intelligence for selecting their behavior itself which sometimes does not appropriate to accomplish a team objective. Therefore, in this research we propose to develop smart agent for team coordination to produce better team behavior. Fuzzy coordinator method is employed for team coordination based on smart agent as a leader in attacking scenario. The smart agent coordinates a team strategy with uncoordinated action from the NPC to produce coordinated action for each NPC. Gaussian distribution is used to make variation action of each NPC more natural and unpredictable.

To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform. We first present an innovative autonomic computing technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS) to endow the cloud system with distinctive capabilities of perception, detection, reflection, and learning. Then, we propose a BANS-based Prognostics and Health Management (BPHM) technology to enable the cloud system self-dealing with various memory anomalies. AI-based failure prognostics, immediate self-healing, self-learning ability and self-improvement functions are implemented. Experimental results illustrate that the designed BPHM can automatically and intelligently deal with complex memory anomalies in a real cloud system for IaaS, to keep the system much more reliable and healthier.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9282796/,"2020 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security (QRS)",11-14 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICPHM.2019.8819386,Part Name Normalization,IEEE,Conferences,"Parts information plays a key role in prognostics and health management. However, expressions of parts often have a wide range of variations, spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. Normalization of such terms is crucial for many applications. Part names post a major challenge also because they tend to be in the form of multi-word terms. In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method UNAMER (Unification and Normalization Analysis, Misspelling Evaluation and Recognition). It is a general method for identifying term variants, including multi-word term variants, and normalizing them under a canonical name. UNAMER does not rely on a predefined set of canonical terms, which is often hard to obtain. Given a term, UNAMER first identifies candidate variants by exploiting contextual information. It then uses a supervised machine learning model, trained using easy-to-generate examples, that leverages both contextual and lexical features to predict actual variants from the candidates. UNAMER further extends its capability to normalize multi-word parts, such as part names like `lt pnl', `letf pnl' and `lft panal' for `left panel' using a specialized linguistically motivated term alignment approach. UNAMER has been deployed in practical applications to normalize part names in the aerospace domain. We will use examples from these real-life applications to demonstrate and illustrate results from UNAMER.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8819386/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM),17-20 June 2019,ieeexplore

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8101902/,2017 Internet Technologies and Applications (ITA),12-15 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

The Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) property of DWT is used for the extraction of the detailed components form the inverter line-to-line voltage and subsequently, these are used for the computation of energy at each level. Additionally, various voltage ratios from the line-to-line voltage are computed. In fact, line-to-line voltage is independent of the nature of load and hence, it is considered as the analysing signal. The voltage ratios together with the calculated energies are considered as the important features for the ANN training for short-switch faults. The whole scheme is implemented by simulation in Matlab/ Simulink. The simulation results show that the scheme successfully identifies the short switch fault for any switch health conditions. Moreover, the scheme is simple and does not involve too many computations. This ensures the real time applicability of the proposed algorithm in any fast acting digital signal processor.

An end- to-end deep learning approach based on residual network (ResNet) architecture is proposed to estimate RR using PPG. This approach takes time-series PPG data as input, learns the rules through the training process that involved an additional synthetic PPG dataset generated to overcome the insufficient data problem of deep learning, and provides RR estimation as outputs. The inclusion of a synthetic dataset for training improved the performance of the deep learning model by 34%. The final mean absolute error performance of the deep learning approach for RR estimation was 2.5±0.6 brpm using 5-fold cross-validation in two widely used public PPG datasets (n=95) with reliable RR references. The deep learning model achieved comparable performance to that of a classical method, which was also implemented for comparison. With large real-world data and reference ground truth, deep learning can be valuable for RR or other vital sign monitoring using PPG and other physiological signals.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9176231/,2020 42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC),20-24 July 2020,ieeexplore

This study aims to develop a robot assistant that facilitates mindfulness training by means of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. To achieve this goal, we collected EEG signals from two groups of subjects engaging in a meditative vs. non-meditative human-robot interaction (HRI) and evaluated cerebral hemispheric asymmetry, which is recognized as a well-defined indicator of emotional states. Moreover, using self-reported affective states, we strived to explain asymmetry changes based on pre- and post-experiment mood alterations. We found that unlike earlier meditation studies, the fronto-central activations in alpha and theta frequency bands were not influenced by robot-guided mindfulness practice, however there was a significantly greater right-sided activity in the occipital gamma band of Meditation group, which is attributed to increased sensory awareness and open monitoring. In addition, there was a significant main effect of Time on participant's self-reported affect, indicating an improved mood after interaction with the robot regardless of the interaction type. Our results suggest that EEG responses during robot-guided meditation hold promise in real-time detection and neurofeedback of mindful state to the user, however the experienced neurophysiological changes may differ based on the meditation practice and recruited tools. This study is the first to report EEG changes during mindfulness practice with a robot. We believe that our findings driven from an ecologically valid setting, can be used in development of future BCI systems that are integrated with social robots for health applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223428/,2020 29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN),31 Aug.-4 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

This needs to be supported by an IoT cyber-infrastructure for reliable and scalable data acquisition from the edge to the Cloud. The low accuracy of such sensors also motivates the need for data-driven calibration models that can accurately predict the science variables from the raw sensor signals. Here, we offer our experiences with designing and deploying such an IoT software platform and calibration models, and validate it through a pilot field deployment at two mega-cities, Delhi and Mumbai. Our edge data service is able to even-out the differential bandwidths from the sensing devices and to the Cloud repository, and recover from transient failures.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8384099/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS),17-20 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore
10.1109/SMARTCOMP52413.2021.00037,STAR: A Scalable Self-taught Learning Framework for Older Adults’ Activity Recognition,IEEE,Conferences,"Activity Recognition (AR) in older adults living with Neurocognitive disorders caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s is still a challenging research problem. The inherent natural variation in performing an activity increases while repeating the same activity for an older adult, let alone the variation introduced when another older adult performs the same activity. Moreover, the challenges in acquiring the labeled data while preserving the privacy, availability of annotators with domain knowledge, aversion towards cameras even for a minimal amount of time for ground truth data collection, and psychological and mental health status make AR for older adults challenging. In this paper, we postulate a self-taught learning-based approach that helps recognize activities with variations that are not being directly seen during the training phase. We hypothesize that the features extracted using deep architectures from unlabeled data instances can learn general underlying representations of activities efficiently and help improve activity classification in a supervised setting, although the data instances in labeled data do not follow the generative distribution of that of unlabeled data. We posit real data from a retirement community center using our in-house SenseBox infrastructure and survey-based assessments concurrently done by a clinical evaluator to study the relationship between activities and functional/behavioral health of older adults. We evaluate our proposed self-taught learning-based approach, STAR, using the presented in-house Alzheimer’s Activity Recognition (AAR) dataset acquired in a real-world deployment in 25 homes which outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by about 20%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9556229/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP),23-27 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

However, the increased security incidents and leakage of patient data raise the concerns to address security risks and privacy issues of mhealth applications urgently. While recent mobile health applications that rely on password-based authentication cannot withstand password guessing and cracking attacks, several countermeasures such as One-Time Password (OTP), grid-based password, and biometric authentication have recently been implemented to protect mobile health applications. These countermeasures, however, can be thwarted by brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and persistent malware attacks. This paper proposed grid-based honey encryption by hybridising honey encryption with grid-based authentication. Compared to recent honey encryption limited in the hardening password attacks process, the proposed grid-based honey encryption can be further employed against shoulder surfing, smudge and replay attacks. Instead of rejecting access as a recent security defence mechanism in mobile healthcare applications, the proposed Grid-based Honey Encryption creates an indistinct counterfeit patient's record closely resembling the real patients' records in light of each off-base speculation legitimate password.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9573645/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering and Technology (IICAIET),13-15 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

Nowadays IoT is being used in many fields of Information Technology and general life like in the fields of health, agriculture, weather etc. Due to its advantages it is getting popularity and hence attracting the hackers and attackers for novel attacks. To run the IoT related services interruption free and to save the private data of the network users, the installation of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential step. The efficiency of an IDS depends upon the efficiency of classifier being used inside the IDS for detecting the attacks or intrusion. To become an IDS an efficient IDS, it should not only be efficient in major performance measuring parameters but also it should be as quick as possible to detect the intrusion in the network so that it can detect the attack in real time. To achieve this objective many classifiers have been used for the implementation of IDS. In this work, tree-based ensemble methods are used for checking their performance to identify network attacks in IoT architecture. For this purpose, BoT-IoT dataset, a well-known and publicly available dataset is used for the said purpose. The tree-based ensemble methods used in this work for identifying the attacks in the IoT network are Random Forest, LGBM, Extra Tree, Gradient Boost, XGBoost. The performance measuring metrics calculated to measure the performance of a method are Accuracy, F1, Recall and Precision. Also, the detection time of all the methods have been calculated.

Unlike traditional Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), self-aware SoCs must deploy an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing infrastructure that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the systems behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). Self-aware SoCs require a combination of ubiquitous sensing and actuation, health-monitoring, and self-learning to enable the SoCs adaptation over time and space.

The essential part of this method is based on an adaptive network architecture which utilizes both fuzzy model (FIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). While battery aging proceeds, the system is capable of delivering accurate power prediction for the typical temperature range. Due to design property of ANN, the network parameters are adapted on-line to the current states (state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature). SoC is required as an input parameter to SoAP module and high accuracy is crucial for a reliable self-learning capability. Therefore, a reasonable way to determine the battery state variables is proposed applying a combination of several partly different algorithms. Among others SoC boundary estimation methods, robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for recalibration of amp hour counters was implemented. ANFIS then achieves the SoAP estimation by means of time forward voltage prognosis (TFVP) before a power pulse. The tradeoff between computational cost of batch-learning and accuracy during on-line adaptation was optimized resulting in a real-time system.

10.1109/DS-RT.2007.38,Semantic Web Service Architecture for Simulation Model Reuse,IEEE,Conferences,"COTS simulation packages (CSPs) have proved popular in an industrial setting with a number of software vendors. In contrast, options for re-using existing models seem more limited. Re-use of simulation component models by collaborating organizations is restricted by the same semantic issues however that restrict the inter-organization use of web services. The current representations of web components are predominantly syntactic in nature lacking the fundamental semantic underpinning required to support discovery on the emerging semantic web. Semantic models, in the form of ontology, utilized by web service discovery and deployment architecture provide one approach to support simulation model reuse. Semantic interoperation is achieved through the use of simulation component ontology to identify required components at varying levels of granularity (including both abstract and specialized components). Selected simulation components are loaded into a CSP, modified according to the requirements of the new model and executed. The paper presents the development of ontology, connector software and web service discovery architecture in order to understand how such ontology are created, maintained and subsequently used for simulation model reuse. The ontology is extracted from health service simulation - comprising hospitals and the National Blood Service. The ontology engineering framework and discovery architecture provide a novel approach to inter- organization simulation, uncovering domain semantics and adopting a less intrusive interface between participants.

10.1109/INDIANCC.2016.7441102,Sensor health monitoring using simple data driven approaches,IEEE,Conferences,"Present day high end vehicles contain as many as 100 microprocessors and have more than 100 million lines of code [3]. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7441102/,2016 Indian Control Conference (ICC),4-6 Jan. 2016,ieeexplore

For this, a system able to handle continuous streams of data is required. Such a system can extract the information by using appropriate classification and learning algorithms and thus allow the remote monitoring of health and wellbeing at a high level. The implementation requires: the use of appropriate sensing technologies, identification of ADLs, data pre-processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models. Experimental results show that SensoryGANs models have the capability of capturing the implicit distribution of real sensor data of human activity, and then the synthetic sensor data generated by SensoryGANs models Have a potential for improving human activity recognition.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489106/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

The classifier is trained using historical data containing examples of events of interest, such as recordings taken when maintenance activity or failures have developed. In practice, the labels are used to pre-filter the data, to bring swift attention to events of interest, and to automatically create categorised datasets which can be used to analyse historical performance. Two different types of classifier are presented: a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier and a neural network classifier. The second tool is a simple pattern recognition algorithm which can determine when the different phases of mechanical operation in a single track switch movement occur, for example locking, unlocking, and moving. The final tool is a statistical technique which is used to extract simple features from the data and raise alarms if they indicate poor track switch performance. The effectiveness of these tools is tested using real world data taken from three different railways.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7920684/,7th IET Conference on Railway Condition Monitoring 2016 (RCM 2016),27-28 Sept. 2016,ieeexplore
10.23919/EETA.2019.8804567,State of Health Estimation of Lithium Batteries for Automotive Applications with Artificial Neural Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the estimation of the State of Health (SOH) in Lithium batteries. The method exploits a feed-forward pattern recognition classifier trained with datasets collected at different temperatures and at a predefined current mean value of the discharging profile. During the real implementation, the algorithm scans the time history of the battery load and analyses it on buffers of 60 seconds. Whenever the same conditions of the training dataset are encountered during the scanning (i.e. the same temperature and current mean value), the designed algorithm is enabled and provides an estimation of the SOH. The classifier acquires as input a set of predictors extracted from the direct measurement of characteristic parameters of the battery, namely voltage, temperature, capacity, energy and estimated State of Charge (SOC). The networks are trained and validated by means of a battery model based on look-up tables and previously characterized in a laboratory environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804567/,2019 AEIT International Conference of Electrical and Electronic Technologies for Automotive (AEIT AUTOMOTIVE),2-4 July 2019,ieeexplore

In addition to the environmental advantages, cycling aids in improving public health, increasing cycling population and contributing to transit use. With the increasing number of bike-sharing service providers around the world, a real-time demand-supply tracking system which brings together the service providers and bike enthusiasts is implemented. Though there are several bike-sharing applications readily available for the users, currently there are no apps for the bike-sharing owners to track the demand-supply for bikes in real-time for any given station. We implemented a real-time demand-supply system that provides to the bike owner information regarding the demand-supply for bikes in any particular station at any particular time through a dashboard and also does forecasting of the bike demand. The Bike Demand forecasting uses the following classifiers: random forest, gradient boosting and linear regression, to predict the number of bikes in demand at a particular station in real-time. Results from the above-mentioned methods are compared and the method with the best results is chosen to supplement information provided by the dashboard to show the demand. For all three of our datasets, XGBoost on the dataset with all stations outperformed all the other models and hence XGBoost on trips data was chosen for the web application. Bike share providers will know the demand for any particular station which will enable them to fetch bikes from stations using the Web UI. Bike shortages due to uneven bike distribution are avoided with high accuracy due to fast prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9375958/,2021 IEEE 11th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC),27-30 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore

In this study, a supervised machine learning-based fall detection was developed using a wearable accelerometer device fitted to the subject's waist. Fifteen volunteers performed a standardized set of movements which were developed by mimicking the scenarios in the FARSEEING Fall Repository, including 10 falling activities and 10 non-falling activities, resulting in a dataset with 900 samples. Supervised Learning is implemented by using two training sets: (1) 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities and (2) 10 real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository added to the 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities. Testing is done by using the remaining 20% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities, remaining five real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository, and actual testing in a simulated environment. Results show that the model with the training data using simulated falls only (Model 1) detected a 10% TPR while the model with real-world fall added (Model 2) detected a 100% TPR when tested using unseen data. Validating using the actual simulated fall and non-falls, Model l resulted in a 93.33% TPR and Model 2 at 96.67%.

Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system.

In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time.

Moreover, application of prolonged and multiple capacity tests can be detrimental to the health of the battery. In view of these concerns, this article continues a line of research into capacity fade estimation approaches that require less data and time for the data generation process; in particular, an approach using rule based machine learning for Li-ion battery packs is proposed. Using data generated in the laboratory, aging behavior is characterized by measurable features and a supervised learning approach in order to estimate capacity fade using real-time operational data toward the goal of eliminating the need for specific capacity tests.

For Human Activity Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have shown their capability to provide better performance compared to other machine learning methods. However, ANNs suffer from two major limitations. First, ANNs are often trained using supervised learning requiring labelled databases, which are often difficult to build in real applications. Then, those algorithms are usually very expensive in terms of computing power. For that reason, their integration into low-power microcontrollers has been so far only evaluated to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the embedded implementation of different neural networks for human activity recognition. First, supervised learning approaches are presented, followed by an exploratory study of unsupervised learning approaches using Self-Organizing Maps.

Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-to-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

10.1109/IEMCON.2019.8936183,User Modeling via Anomaly Detection Techniques for User Authentication,IEEE,Conferences,"Anomaly detection is quickly becoming a very significant tool for a variety of applications such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, system health monitoring, and event detection in IoT devices. An application that lacks a strong implementation for anomaly detection is user trait modeling. User trait models expose up-to-date representation of the user so that changes in their interests, their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and interpreted. The reason behind the lack of adoption in user trait modeling arises from the need for a continuous flow of high-volume data, that is not available in most cases, to achieve high-accuracy detection. This paper provides new insight into the anomaly detection techniques through Big Data utilization. With Big Data characteristics, i.e., volume, variety and velocity, anomaly detection techniques have become more suitable tools for user trait modeling. User traits will be modeled by creating a security user profile for each user. This profile is structured and developed to be a source for a strong real-time user authentication method. An ingenious implementation of three models; k-means, HMM, and auto-encoder neural network has been presented that automatically and accurately build a unique pattern of the users' behavior. The implementation comprises four main steps: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions. Real-world scenarios have been given showing the benefits of these challenging questions in building secure knowledge-based user authentication systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936183/,"2019 IEEE 10th Annual Information Technology, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (IEMCON)",17-19 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

In this paper we test the hypothesis that the application of machine learning techniques on data of this nature can be used to address prediction/forecasting problems in the Health IT domain. The novelty of this approach consists in that medical data (test results, diagnoses, doctors' notes etc.) are not included in the predictors' dataset. Moreover, there is limited need for separation of patient cohorts based on specific health conditions. Methods: We experiment with the prediction of the probability of early readmission at the time of a patient's discharge. We extract real HIS data and perform data processing techniques. We then apply a series of machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Deep Multilayer Neural Network) and measure the performance of the emergent models. Results: All applied methods performed well above random guessing, even with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. Conclusions: Given that the experiments provide evidence in favor of the underlying hypothesis, future experimentation on more fine-tuned (thus more robust) models could result in applications suited for productive environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8614004/,2018 International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering (iCMLDE),3-7 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life.

The fall prevention has hence become a popular topic in health informatics. An effective fall prevention paradigm could save millions of people from injury and avoid considerable casualties. Through comparison studies, detail-oriented simulations, and pragmatic field tests, an effective fall prediction method has been developed by authors. The finding is presented in this paper. Three techniques for fall prediction are discussed in this paper. A comparison technique to mimic the traditional stateless fall prediction techniques, along with an algorithm using artificial neural network, was first implemented in authors' previous paper. Then a robotic scheme was developed to simulate human fall by transplanting a proven fall prediction paradigm for humanoid robots with controlled electric drive systems to human subjects. Due to its simulation nature far from the human fall scenarios in reality, the robotic paradigm has obvious limits in real world applications.

10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer.

These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood.

They also cannot dynamically adapt the detection capability to runtime observations to save energy. Therefore, we are motivated to propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption.

An important field of research in this context is the monitoring of health risks and the identification of falls. It is estimated that every year, one in three persons older than 65 years will fall, and fall events are associated with high mortality rates among the elderly. We propose an anomaly identification framework to detect falls, which incorporates a spatial-temporal convolutional graph network (ST-GCN) as a feature extractor and uses an encoder process to reconstruct ADLs and identify falls as anomalies. As the publicly available fall datasets are few and generally unbalanced, training a reliable model using approaches that need explicit labeling is challenging. Thus, a focus on learning without external supervision is desirable. Treating a fall as an exception of ADLs allows us to recognize falls as anomalies without explicit labels. Given its modular architecture, our framework can robustly represent visual information and use the encoder's reconstruction error to identify falls as anomalies.

Thirty-six million people are estimated to be blind. According to WHO, 217 million people are estimated to have moderate to severe visual impairment. An important factor that motivated this research is the fact that 90% of VI people live in developing countries. Several systems were designed to improve the quality of the life of VI people and support their mobility. Unfortunately, none of these systems are considered to be a complete solution for VI people and these systems are very expensive. We present in this paper an intelligent framework for supporting VI people.

These techniques allow us to detect multiple objects and enhance the accuracy of the collision avoidance system. In addition, we introduce a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the image depth information and fuzzy logic. By using the fuzzy logic, we were able to provide precise information to help the VI user in avoiding front obstacles. The system has been deployed and tested in real-time scenarios.

10.1109/TBME.2018.2888998,A Machine Hearing System for Robust Cough Detection Based on a High-Level Representation of Band-Specific Audio Features,IEEE,Journals,"Cough is a protective reflex conveying information on the state of the respiratory system. Cough assessment has been limited so far to subjective measurement tools or uncomfortable (i.e., non-wearable) cough monitors. This limits the potential of real-time cough monitoring to improve respiratory care. Objective: This paper presents a machine hearing system for audio-based robust cough segmentation that can be easily deployed in mobile scenarios. Methods: Cough detection is performed in two steps. First, a short-term spectral feature set is separately computed in five predefined frequency bands: [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), [1, 1.5), [1.5, 2), and [2, 5.5125] kHz. Feature selection and combination are then applied to make the short-term feature set robust enough in different noisy scenarios. Second, high-level data representation is achieved by computing the mean and standard deviation of short-term descriptors in 300 ms long-term frames. Finally, cough detection is carried out using a support vector machine trained with data from different noisy scenarios. The system is evaluated using a patient signal database which emulates three real-life scenarios in terms of noise content. Results: The system achieves 92.71% sensitivity, 88.58% specificity, and 90.69% Area Under Receiver Operating Charcteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Our research outcome paves the way to create a device for cough monitoring in real-life situations. Significance: Our proposal is aligned with a more comfortable and less disruptive patient monitoring, with benefits for patients (allows self-monitoring of cough symptoms), practitioners (e.g., assessment of treatments or better clinical understanding of cough patterns), and national health systems (by reducing hospitalizations).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8584081/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data.

For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques.

Providing high-intensity rehabilitation sessions or home assistance through low-cost robotic devices can be indeed an effective solution to democratize services otherwise not accessible to everyone.

Manual weedicide spray through bag-pack is hazardous to human health. Localized autonomous weedicide spray through aerial spraying units can help save water, weedicide chemical and effect less on human health. Such systems require multi-spectral cues to classify crop, weed, and soil surface. Our focus in this paper is on the detection of weeds in the sugar beet crop, using air-borne multispectral camera sensors, which is considered as an alternative crop to sugarcane to obtain sugar in Pakistan. We developed a new framework for weed identification; a patch-based classification approach as appose to semantic segmentation that is more realistic for real-time intelligent aerial spraying systems. Our approach converts 3-class pixel classification problem into a 2-class crop-weed patch classification problem which in turns improves crop and weed classification accuracy. For classification, we developed a new VGG-Beet convolutional neural network (CNN), which is based on generic VGG16 (visual graphics group) CNN model with 11 convolutional layers. For experiments, we captured a sugar beet dataset with 3-channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 0.2 cm/pixel and a height of 4 meters. For better comparison, we used two publicly available sugar beet crop aerial imagery datasets, captured using a 5-channel multispectral sensor and a 4-Channel multispectral sensor with a ground sampling distance of 1cm and a height of 10 meters. We observed that patch-based method is more robust to different lighting conditions. To produce low cost weed detection system usage of Agrocam sensor is recommended, for higher accuracy Red Edge and Sequoia multispectral sensors with more channels should be deployed.

Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller. Our proposed architecture showcases an efficient approach to handle future interruption and faults in power grid using cost-effective and reliable infrastructure that can predict and provide real-time health monitoring indices for the Iraqi grid network with minimal power interruptions.

10.1109/TCBB.2017.2780106,A Sparse Regression Method for Group-Wise Feature Selection with False Discovery Rate Control,IEEE,Journals,"The method of Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, or SLOPE, is a sparse regression method recently introduced by Bogdan et. al. [1] . It can be used to identify significant predictor variables in a linear model that may have more unknown parameters than observations. When the correlations between predictor variables are small, the SLOPE method is shown to successfully control the false discovery rate (the expected proportion of the irrelevant among all selected predictors) at a user specified level. However, the requirement for nearly uncorrelated predictors is too restrictive for genomic data, as demonstrated in our recent study [2] by an application of SLOPE to realistic simulated DNA sequence data. A possible solution is to divide the predictor variables into nearly uncorrelated groups, and to modify the procedure to select entire groups with an overall significant group effect, rather than individual predictors. Following this motivation, we extend SLOPE in the spirit of Group LASSO to Group SLOPE, a method that can handle group structures between the predictor variables, which are ubiquitous in real genomic data. Our theoretical results show that Group SLOPE controls the group-wise false discovery rate (gFDR), when groups are orthogonal to each other. For use in non-orthogonal settings, we propose two types of Monte Carlo based heuristics, which lead to gFDR control with Group SLOPE in simulations based on real SNP data. As an illustration of the merits of this method, an application of Group SLOPE to a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study results in the identification of some known DNA sequence regions associated with bone health, as well as some new candidate regions.

Fall detection system (FDS) that alerts caregivers or family members can potentially save lives of the elderly. However, conventional FDS involves wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This article presents a passive device-free FDS based on commodity WiFi framework for smart home, which is mainly composed of two modules in terms of hardware platform and client application. Concretely, commercial WiFi devices collect disturbance signal induced by human motions from smart home and transmit the data to a data analysis platform for further processing. Based on this basis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is used to eliminate the influence of random noise presented in the collected data. Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to classify human motions and identify the fall status automatically. By leveraging Web Application Programming Interface (API), the analyzed data is able to be uploaded to the proxy server from which the client application then obtains the corresponding fall information. Moreover, the system has been implemented as a consumer mobile App that can help the elderly saving their lives in smart home, and detection performance of the proposed FDS has been evaluated by conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world dataset.

In this article, we present “AirScope,” a mobile sensing system that employs cooperative robots to monitor the indoor air quality.

In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own. In addition, the cooperation of the robots is also necessary because the aggregation of the robots in a small area increases the average data latency of the other unattended areas. To solve this distributed and cooperative routing planning problem, we propose a solution based on distributed deep Q-learning (DDQL).

Most real datasets include an irregular subset with higher variance than most data, and predictive models do not learn well from these datasets. While most existing prediction models learned from the whole or randomly sampled training datasets, our suggested method draws up training datasets by separating regular and highly biased subsets to build accurate prediction models. We use a two-step approach to prepare the training dataset: (1) divide the initial training dataset into two groups, commonly distributed and highly biased using Principal Component Analysis, (2) enrich the highly biased group by Variational Autoencoders. Then, two deep neural network classifiers learn from the isolated training groups separately. The well-organized training groups enable a chance to build more accurate prediction models.

We evaluated the proposed method with the rolling bearing dataset from Western Reserve University. The best average precision, recall and F1 score of ten different bearing health conditions are about 96%, 82% and 88%, respectively. In addition, we also compare the accuracy of the rolling bearing fault diagnosis classification model under the standard ReLU and the improved ReLU. Experimental results show that both obtain good performances, but the improved ReLU reaches the over 96% accuracy more rapidly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9374431/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2852004,An Ontology-Based Interpretable Fuzzy Decision Support System for Diabetes Diagnosis,IEEE,Journals,"Diabetes is a serious chronic disease. The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS. The designed system considers the ontology semantic similarity of diabetes complications and symptoms concepts in the fuzzy rules' evaluation process. The framework was tested using a real data set, and the results indicate how the proposed system helps physicians and patients to accurately diagnose diabetes mellitus.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8403911/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

It includes sophisticated applications such as malpractice detection in the examination, distracted driving, gesture detection, etc., and requires robust and reliable pose estimation techniques. These applications help to map the attention of the user with head pose estimation (HPE) metrics supported by emotion and gaze analysis. This paper solves the problem of attention score estimation with HPE. The proposed method ensures ease of implementation while addressing head pose estimation using 68 facial features. Further, to attain reliability and precision, head pose estimation has been implemented as a regression task.

Such a learning model is able to assess health states in real time provided that both training and testing samples are complete and have the same probability distribution. However, it is rare and difficult in practical applications to meet these requirements due to the continuous change in working conditions. Besides, conventional hyperparameters tuning via grid search or manual tuning requires a lot of human intervention and becomes inflexible for users. Two objectives are targeted in this work. In an attempt to remedy the data distribution mismatch issue, we firstly introduce a feature extraction and selection approach built upon correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction. Secondly, to diminish human intervention burdens, we propose an Automatic artificial Neural network with an Augmented Hidden Layer (Auto-NAHL) for the classification of health states. Within the designed network, it is worthy to mention that the novelty of the implemented neural architecture is attributed to the new multiple feature mappings of the inputs, where such configuration allows the hidden layer to learn multiple representations from several random linear mappings and produce a single final efficient representation. Hyperparameters tuning including the network architecture, is fully automated by incorporating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique.

According to operating experience data and the type of mining machine, total loss failure rates per machine fleet can reach up to 30%. Vibration analysis techniques are commonly used for condition monitoring and early detection of unforeseen failures to generate predictive maintenance plans for heavy machinery. However, this maintenance strategy is intensively used only for stationary machines and/or mobile machinery in stationary operations. Today, there is a lack of proper solutions to detect and prevent critical failures for non-stationary machinery. This paper shows a cost-effective solution proposal for implementing a vibration sensor network with wireless communication and machine learning data-driven capabilities for condition monitoring of non-stationary heavy machinery in mining operations. During the machine operation, 3-axis accelerations were measured using two sensors deployed across the machine. The machine accelerations (amplitudes and frequencies) are measured in two different frequency spectrums to improve each sensing location's time resolution.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms.

The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy.

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&amp;G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&amp;G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&amp;G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&amp;G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&amp;G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&amp;G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&amp;G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&amp;G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&amp;G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&amp;G industry is still at an early stage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9104682/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

In this study, the benefits of relying on a deployed Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) concerning the overall reputation of a health facility has been studied. The analysis is performed in terms of a co-operative Bayesian game-theoretic model. The game is played between two players of which the first player is a patient who needs quick and accurate medical attention and the second player is the hospital administration that relies on medical experts as well as integrated multi-objective clinical data classification systems for decision-making. The proposed model “MEAF” - Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm using Fuzzy Genetics attempts to address accuracy and interpretability simultaneously using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). This model enables a H<sub>CDSS</sub> to detect a disease accurately by using the available resources efficiently. The results of our simulation show that H<sub>CDSS</sub> produces better and accurate results in detecting disease with efficient resource utilization along with the reduced computational cost.

Although various approaches that explore physiological and physical factors to classify driver fatigue have been developed, the overall accuracy, recognition speed, distraction in the driving process and the cost of these systems still need to be improved. In this paper, we present a low-cost driver fatigue level prediction framework (DFLP) for detecting driver fatigue in its earliest stages. DFLP predicts drive fatigue based on eyes, mouth, and head behavior cues using a non-physical contact sensor input (infrared radiation) (IR) camera. DFLP classifies the level of drowsiness and attributes the level of altering accordingly. To validate the proposed fatigue prediction framework, we conducted the experiment using real datasets under night and day illumination conditions. The results of the experiment show that the proposed approach can predict the level of driver's fatigue with 93.3% overall accuracy.

Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs. However, there is a shortage of visible work that focus on early-stage risk prediction of these diseases. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based health CPS framework that addresses the challenge of effectively processing the wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diabetes as an example of NCDs. In the experiment, a verified diabetic dataset has been used for training, while the testing has been performed on an artificially generated data collection from sensors.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches.

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

Most machine learning methods achieve good results based on the assumption of data balance. However, the scarce fault data of harmonic drive is difficult to collect, resulting in various imbalanced health status samples, which has an adverse effect on fault diagnosis. In this article, we propose a data generation method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve the problem of data imbalance and utilize the multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to realize the fault diagnosis of the harmonic drive. First, the data collected from three vibration acceleration sensors are preprocessed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency spectrum of the vibration signal. Second, multiple GANs were adopted to generate various fault spectrum data and the data selection module (DSM) is elaborately designed to filter and purify these data. Third, the filtered generated data will be combined with the real data to form a balanced dataset, and then the MSCNN is used to achieve multiclassification of the health status of the harmonic drive.

It also helps to manage calorie intake by accounting for the amount of calorie consumed from beverages. While staying hydrated and controlling calorie intake is critical in both physical wellness and cognitive health, existing technologies do not provide a solution for monitoring both fluid type and fluid volume. To address this limitation, we present the design, implementation, and validation of Liquid Intake Detection System (LIDS) for real-time tracking of fluid intake type and volume. The system devises a sensing module that is composed of ultrasonic, RGB color, temperature, and accelerometer sensors as well as a computational framework for machine-learning-based fluid intake type classification, volume estimation, and bottle-state-recognition. The developed sensing unit is small and light-weight that can be mounted, from inside, on the lid of a drinking bottle. We conduct extensive experiments to collect data in a variety of bottles and environmental settings. The results show that the accuracy of fluid type detection ranges from 74.93% to 94.98% while trying to detect the fluid of an unseen bottle.

These scenarios call for more advanced performance in application-specific algorithms and efficient hardware support. Warnings on health emergencies sensitive to response speed require low latency output and action early detection capabilities. Medical monitoring that works in an always-on edge platform needs the system processor to have extreme energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MC-LSTM, a functional and versatile 3D skeleton-based action detection system, for the above demands. Our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on trimmed and untrimmed cases of general-purpose and medical-specific datasets with early-detection features.

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set.

This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F<sub>z</sub> 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping).

However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings. Experimental results on the benchmark tasks show that PKRLS obtains a parsimonious network structure with the satisfactory prediction accuracy.

Bayesian estimation algorithms adopt the model's predicted data as prior information in combination with online measurements to update the degree of belief in the forecasting estimations. In order to simplify the implementation of the proposed approach, a recursive Bayesian algorithm called particle filtering is utilized to calculate in real time a posterior PDF by a set of random samples (or particles) with associated weights.

Therefore, objective assessment of the GB (e.g. detection, spatio-temporal analysis) during daily life is very important. A feasible and effective way of GB detection in real-world situations is using a wrist-mounted inertial measurement unit. However, the high degree of freedom of the wrist movements during daily-life situations imposes serious challenges for a precise and robust automatic detection. In this study, we deal with such challenges and propose an accurate algorithm to detect GB using a wrist-mounted accelerometer. Features, derived based on biomechanical criteria (intensity, periodicity, posture, and other non-gait dynamicity), along with a Bayes estimator followed by two physically-meaningful post-classification procedures are devised to optimize the performance. The proposed method has been validated against a shank-based reference algorithm on two datasets (29 young and 37 elderly healthy people).

In order to train such tracking algorithms in NE, however, annotated data is needed, particularly when tracking a variety of activities of daily living. These algorithms are often trained in laboratory settings, with expectations that they will perform equally well in NE, which is often not the case; they must be trained on annotated data collected in NE and wearable computers provide opportunities to collect such data, though the process is burdensome. Therefore, we propose an intelligent scoring algorithm that limits the number of user annotation requests through the confidence of predictions generated by the tracking algorithm and automatically annotating data with high confidence. We enhance our scoring algorithm by providing improvements in our tracking algorithm by obtaining context data from nearable sensors. Each specific context of a user bounds the set of activities that can likely occur, which in turn improves the tracking algorithm and confidence. Finally, we propose a hierarchical annotation approach, where repeated use allows us to ask for detailed annotations that differentiate fine-grained differences in ways individuals perform activities. We validate our approach in a diet monitoring case study.

One of the most vital problems of a flare stack is the incomplete combustion of flare gas, which produces a large amount of flare soot and, thus, endangers the atmosphere and human health. Hence, an effective and efficient flare soot monitoring system that has important guiding significance to environmental protection is strongly required. To this end, we devise a vision-based monitor of flare soot (VMFS) that can search for flare soot in a timely way and ensure the full combustion of flare gas. First, the proposed VMFS leverages the broadly tuned color channel to recognize a flame in an input video frame since the flame is the source of flare soot in our application.

10.1109/WiMOB.2019.8923286,Design and Deployment of a Wireless BAN at the Edge for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"Body Area Networks (BANs) have attracted a lot of research interest in the last decades as also witnessed by standardization activities and European Commission fundings. Today, commercial devices, which implement simplified BAN monitoring have appeared, although they usually imply expensive subscription costs or need for a supporting device carried by the user (e.g. a smart phone) which, in case of elderly people, cannot be easily held. However, the integration between commercial devices and external sensors located on/in the body is still an open issue due to the limited processing capabilities of low cost commercial devices. Also, no tools for anomaly detection aimed at reliable healthcare monitoring are currently commercially available. In this paper, we focus on Cloud-Assisted BANs and evolve this vision according to the emerging paradigm of edge computing. We present design, implementation and experimentation of a wireless BAN system which performs data transmission using a commercial, cheap, off-the-shelf gateway smart watch. A mechanism for prompt anomaly detection at the edge node is also supported for the purpose of reliable healthcare monitoring as well as pre-filtering of the data at the smart device itself. Also, in order to reduce the overhead caused by propagation of useless and time-correlated data, and to guarantee a prompt action in case of emergency, edge network nodes located closer to the patient BAN are exploited since they can execute machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and activate potential alerts in a shorter time and without overloading the cloud. In this work we describe a real system and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in terms of false alarm probability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923286/,"2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)",21-23 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore

In the past ten years, research on activity detection in the home was achieved through the data aggregation from several different sensors (presence sensors, door contacts, appliances tagging, cameras, wearable beacons, mobile phones, etc.). However, the cost of deployment and maintenance of a multitude of sensor devices and the intrusiveness they can infer are quite high. Research on minimal and non-intrusive sensing for recognition of ADLs are vital for the future of remote care. In this paper, we propose a minimal and non-intrusive low-power low-cost radar-based sensing network system that uses an innovative approach for recognizing human activity in the home. We applied our novel approach to the challenging problem of kitchen activity recognition and investigated fifteen different activities. We designed and trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that classifies different activities based on their distinct micro-Doppler signatures.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification.

10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3064841,MC-LSTM: Real-Time 3D Human Action Detection System for Intelligent Healthcare Applications,IEEE,Journals,"Due to the movement expressiveness and privacy assurance of human skeleton data, 3D skeleton-based action inference is becoming popular in healthcare applications. These scenarios call for more advanced performance in application-specific algorithms and efficient hardware support. Warnings on health emergencies sensitive to response speed require low latency output and action early detection capabilities. Medical monitoring that works in an always-on edge platform needs the system processor to have extreme energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MC-LSTM, a functional and versatile 3D skeleton-based action detection system, for the above demands. Our system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on trimmed and untrimmed cases of general-purpose and medical-specific datasets with early-detection features. Further, the MC-LSTM accelerator supports parallel inference on up to 64 input channels. The implementation on Xilinx ZCU104 reaches a throughput of 18 658 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) and an inference latency of 3.5 ms with the batch size of 64. Accordingly, the power consumption is 3.6 W for the whole FPGA+ARM system, which is 37.8x and 10.4x more energy-efficient than the high-end Titan X GPU and i7-9700 CPU, respectively. Meanwhile, our accelerator also keeps a 4 ~ 5x energy efficiency advantage against the low-power high-performance Firefly-RK3399 board carrying an ARM Cortex-A72+A53 CPU. We further synthesize an 8-bit quantized version on the same hardware, providing a 48.8% increase in energy efficiency under the same throughput.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373938/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems,April 2021,ieeexplore

Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture. The results indicate that the proposed architecture is feasible to enable real-time healthcare services and has significant performance advantages over traditional cloud-based approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8482108/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

In this study we investigated the feasibility of generating real-time 3D (i.e., 4D) SHI volumes. Four-dimensional SHI (f<sub>0</sub> = 5.8 MHz, transmitting 4 cycle pulses) was implemented on a Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner with a mechanically controlled 4D10L probe (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Experimental software provided access to both individual slice data and rendered images. This software also allowed imaging in B-mode (at 10 MHz) and harmonic imaging (HI; f<sub>0</sub> = 5 MHz, f<sub>receive</sub>= 10 MHz). Two canines received 5 μl/kg bolus injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) for HI and 20 μl/kg bolus for SHI of the lower renal pole. The contrast-to-tissue ratio was then calculated for three injections in each canine and compared between modes. Patients scheduled for biopsy of a mammographically identified breast lesion provided informed consent. Baseline scanning was performed in both B-mode and power Doppler. Patients then received a 0.25 ml bolus of Definity for HI followed by a bolus injection of 20 μl/kg for SHI. Baseline 2D cine loops, 3D slice data and rendered volumes were saved for off-line comparison. While scan volumes varied, a volume of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm acquired at a 19° volume angle resulted in 45-50 slices per volume at an acquisition rate of 1.8 to 2.2 Hz depending on depth. In the canine model, SHI resulted in significant improvement in contrast visualization and rendered SHI images demonstrated superior tissue suppression and a greater overall view of renal vasculature. In breast lesions, enhancement varied greatly on a case by case basis. However, SHI resulted in improved tissue suppression and detection of contrast in almost all cases.

However, the deployment of new technologies in health applications without taking into account data security makes the privacy of patients vulnerable. Thus, these systems have insufficient performance for large and varied data sets, because they do not process information sufficiently diverse to cover all scenarios. Moreover, the interpretation of physiological signals is a tedious process in which human errors can be caused.To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an effective health system that ensures the secure collection and transfer of patient data to the physician, to facilitate the diagnosis and the detection of life threatening diseases.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

Real-time and accurate objective pain assessment help hospital staffs and caregivers decide the proper dosage of pain medication to be provided to a patient in a timely manner. The state-of-the-art automatic and objective pain assessment techniques in the literature can be classified into two main categories: physiological-based and behavioral-based. The first-class monitors the changes in patients' physiological data such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Photoplethysmography (PPG) to identify autonomic nervous system reactions to pain, while the second class utilizes behavioral reactions to pain such as techniques using computer vision-based techniques by extracting features from patients' head poses and facial expressions. Recent pain monitoring systems have become multi-modal meaning that they deploy a combination of both approaches to improve pain monitoring accuracy. Although such complex models are highly accurate in pain monitoring, they are more computationally intensive imposing feasibility limitations to implement them on wearable devices in terms of energy efficiency (battery life) as well as computation latency. A smart and self-aware system capable of adaptively making a decision at run-time in response to the changes in pain level and context can minimize energy consumption by dynamically offloading tasks to the gateway devices at the edge layer.

The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting. We analyze the performance of the implemented system in terms of response time by varying the velocity and volume of the analyzed data. We also discuss how the cloud resources should be provisioned in order to guarantee processing performance for both long-term and real-time scenarios. To ensure a good tradeoff between cost and processing performance, resources provision should be adapted to the exact needs and characteristics of the considered application.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8734185/,2019 3rd International Conference on Bio-engineering for Smart Technologies (BioSMART),24-26 April 2019,ieeexplore

To consider the user's context of use, we utilized 5 prototypical variables; time, location, weather, emotion, and activities. The developed system derives the best three recommended applications based on the results of supervised learning from such data sets. To consider the history of past context information, in addition to the current one, we developed a novel and effective probabilistic learning and inference algorithm named “Spatiotemporal Structure Learning”. By extending Naïve Bayesian Classifier, the spatiotemporal structure learning can create a probability model which represents relationship between time-series contextual variables. We implemented a prototype system which shows the current context and the inferred recommendation of applications. For the prototype system, we developed an Android widget application for the user interface and a Java-based server application which learns structure from training data and provides inference results in real-time. To gather training data and evaluate proposed system, we conducted a pilot study which showed 69% of accuracy in predicting the user's application usage. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of an adaptive user interface applied to a state of the art smartphone.

Yet there is rarely any research study on the possible uses of smart watches for learning analytics, particularly for analyzing students' learning activities through the physiological and/or movement data collected on their smart watches. This paper considers a pioneering and sophisticated learning analytics platform using fine-tuned deep learning models to predict students' learning activities based on the real-time data, including their heart rates, calories, three-axis accelerometer and gyroscope data, captured on wearable devices and then uploaded onto a cloud server for thorough analyses. To validate on the actual activities conducted by each student, an intelligent mobile application is developed to push instant notifications for students to report their own activities whenever the change of heart rates are deviated significantly from their normal values. Based on students' heart rates and calories, a long-short term memory (LSTM) model is built to classify students' learning states as active or not with an impressive prediction accuracy of 95% whereas another hybrid model combining both the LSTM and convolutional neural networks attains the highest prediction accuracy of 74% to predict students' specific learning activities as based on their physiological and movement data.

10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00281,Asynchronous Block Coordinate Descent Method for Large-Scale Nonconvex Problem in Real World Study,IEEE,Conferences,"Here comes the era of big data in healthcare, and this era will transform medicine and especially oncology. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the potential benefits and the relevance of real world studies (RWS) with to the rapid development of data mining algorithms, as well as large-scale accumulated real world datasets. However, it is beyond the ability of traditional data mining algorithms to solve such large-scale RWS problems due to the large amount of data need to be processed and the difficulty in the problems solving, especially the nonconvex optimization problems. In many cases for these nonconvex problems, the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that the iterative updates are easily trapped in saddle points or bad local optima points. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the sum of a smooth nonlinear function and a block-separable nonconvex function involving a large number of block variables subjected to inequality constraints, which covers a wide range of interesting applications appearing in distributed optimization, statistics learning, etc. However, solving such a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem associated with inequality constraints remains as a challenging task. This is because: 1) it is still an open problem about how to escape from saddle points and bad local optima points using a block coordinate descent method to deal with the nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions; 2) it can be extremely expensive to compute the entire block variables when the problem scale is large. Therefore, we propose a novel parallel first-order optimization method, called as Asynchronous block coordinate descent with Time Perturbation (ATP), which utilizing the time perturbation technique that escapes from saddle points and local optima points. We present a randomized block variable selection rule of the proposed method, as well as the iteration complexity. Experiments conducted on typical machine learning problems in RWS, i.e., folded concave linear regression, validate the efficacy of our optimization method. In particular, the experiment results demonstrate that time perturbation could greatly help the proposed algorithm escape from saddle points and local optima in the nonconvex part, which provides a promising way to tackle nonconvex optimization problems employing block coordinate descent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8855671/,2019 IEEE 21st International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 17th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 5th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),10-12 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

The system (AI-KEN) offers enhanced web support that is integrated to local clinical systems, whereby clinical notes are prompted by suggested predictive text options in real time. The anticipated benefits include reducing financial loss for acute services, support for clinical standard maintenance and enhanced advancements for clinical practice and research in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8948727/,2019 First International Conference on Digital Data Processing (DDP),15-17 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/WiMOB.2019.8923286,Design and Deployment of a Wireless BAN at the Edge for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"Body Area Networks (BANs) have attracted a lot of research interest in the last decades as also witnessed by standardization activities and European Commission fundings. Today, commercial devices, which implement simplified BAN monitoring have appeared, although they usually imply expensive subscription costs or need for a supporting device carried by the user (e.g. a smart phone) which, in case of elderly people, cannot be easily held. However, the integration between commercial devices and external sensors located on/in the body is still an open issue due to the limited processing capabilities of low cost commercial devices. Also, no tools for anomaly detection aimed at reliable healthcare monitoring are currently commercially available. In this paper, we focus on Cloud-Assisted BANs and evolve this vision according to the emerging paradigm of edge computing. We present design, implementation and experimentation of a wireless BAN system which performs data transmission using a commercial, cheap, off-the-shelf gateway smart watch. A mechanism for prompt anomaly detection at the edge node is also supported for the purpose of reliable healthcare monitoring as well as pre-filtering of the data at the smart device itself. Also, in order to reduce the overhead caused by propagation of useless and time-correlated data, and to guarantee a prompt action in case of emergency, edge network nodes located closer to the patient BAN are exploited since they can execute machine learning algorithms to process large amounts of data and activate potential alerts in a shorter time and without overloading the cloud. In this work we describe a real system and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in terms of false alarm probability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8923286/,"2019 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)",21-23 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

When a user tries to request the injected web page, he is not aware that the malicious script code might be affecting his computer. Nowadays, attackers are targeting the web applications that holding a sensitive data (e.g., bank transaction, e-mails, healthcare, and e-banking) to steal users' information and gain full access to the data which make the web applications to be more vulnerable. In this research, we applied three approaches to find a solution to this most challenging attacks issues. In the first approach, we implemented Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to discover and classify XSS attack. In the second approach, we implemented the Content Security Policy (CSP) approach to detect XSS attacks in real-time. In the last approach, we propose a new approach that combines the Web Application Firewall (WAF), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and prevent XSS attack in real-time.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

Single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide the ability to detect, classify, and even predict cardiac arrhythmia. In this paper we propose a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves high accuracy while still being feasible for wearable platform use. Experimental results on the ECG5000 dataset show that the TCN has a similar accuracy (94.2%) score as the state-of-the-art (SoA) network while achieving an improvement of 16.5% in the balanced accuracy score. This accurate classification is done with 27x fewer parameters and 37x less multiply-accumulate operations. We test our implementation on two publicly available platforms, the STM32L475, which is based on ARM Cortex M4F, and the GreenWaves Technologies GAP8 on the GAPuino board, based on 1+8 RISC-V CV32E40P cores.

IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations. For instance, they cannot properly function in areas with poor or unstable Internet. Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring. Therefore, data processing and compression are required at the edge of the network. We propose a system architecture with integrated artificial intelligence that combines Edge and Fog computing, LPWAN technology, IoT and deep learning algorithms to perform health monitoring tasks. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this architecture via a use case of fall detection using recurrent neural networks.

Recently, the AAL IoT ecosystem has been enriched with promising technologies such as edge computing, which has demonstrated to be the best approach to overcome the demanding requirements of AAL and healthcare services by providing a reduction of the amount of data to transfer to the cloud, an improvement of the response time, and quality of experience. Also, the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies at the edge provides intelligence to improve the decision making timely. However, this approach has been scarcely studied in AAL scenarios and the few proposals based on deploying machine learning models at the edge lack efficiency, security, mechanisms of resource management, service management, and deployment, as well as a real and experimental AAL scenario. For these reasons, this paper proposes an innovative edge gateway architecture to support the deployment of deep learning (DL) models in AAL and healthcare scenarios efficiently. To do so, we have added a predictive analytics module to deploy the models. Since AI technologies demand more resources, a container-based virtualization technology is employed on the edge gateway to manage the limited resources, and provide security and lifecycle services management. The edge gateway performance was evaluated deploying a DL-based fall detection application on it.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

A HAR system is essentially made of a wearable device equipped with a set of sensors (like accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, heart-rate sensors, etc...) and a classifier able to recognize the activity performed. In this study we focused on the choice of the classifier, since there isn't a unique and consolidated methodology for HAR. The main aim of the study is to compare the performances of 5 classifiers, based on machine learning. Furthermore, we analyzed advantages and disadvantages of their implementation onto a wearable and realtime HAR system. We acquired magnetic and inertial measurement unit (MIMU) signals from 15 young volunteers. For each subject, we recorded 9 signals from tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. All signals were divided in 5s-windows and processed to extract 342 features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains.

These features were used as input for the following 5 classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). Our results showed that all classifiers were able to correctly recognize more than 90% of activities. The best performances were obtained by KNN.

10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412907,Improving Model Accuracy for Imbalanced Image Classification Tasks by Adding a Final Batch Normalization Layer: An Empirical Study,IEEE,Conferences,"Some real-world domains, such as Agriculture and Healthcare, comprise early-stage disease indications whose recording constitutes a rare event, and yet, whose precise detection at that stage is critical. In this type of highly imbalanced classification problems, which encompass complex features, deep learning (DL) is much needed because of its strong detection capabilities. At the same time, DL is observed in practice to favor majority over minority classes and consequently suffer from inaccurate detection of the targeted early-stage indications. To simulate such scenarios, we artificially generate skewness (99% vs. 1%) for certain plant types out of the PlantVillage dataset as a basis for classification of scarce visual cues through transfer learning. By randomly and unevenly picking healthy and unhealthy samples from certain plant types to form a training set, we consider a base experiment as fine-tuning ResNet34 and VGG19 architectures and then testing the model performance on a balanced dataset of healthy and unhealthy images. We empirically observe that the initial F1 test score jumps from 0.29 to 0.95 for the minority class upon adding a final Batch Normalization (BN) layer just before the output layer in VGG19. We demonstrate that utilizing an additional BN layer before the output layer in modern CNN architectures has a considerable impact in terms of minimizing the training time and testing error for minority classes in highly imbalanced data sets. Moreover, when the final BN is employed, minimizing the loss function may not be the best way to assure a high F1 test score for minority classes in such problems. That is, the network might perform better even if it is not `confident' enough while making a prediction; leading to another discussion about why softmax output is not a good uncertainty measure for DL models.

Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening.

10.1109/ICIAICT.2019.8784859,IoT-NDN: An IoT Architecture via Named Data Netwoking (NDN),IEEE,Conferences,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems have become the central part of future internet research. In the IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe individual tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact with the integrated devices and diverse services. Furthermore, IoT is a promising technology to increase the comfort and quality of life and opens new ways of interaction between people and things. Real life applications in healthcare sectors, home automation, industry, smart cities, monitoring scenarios, etc. benefit from the low-cost wireless technology in IoT on one hand. On the contrary, IoT system has many challenging features: many devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory, are highly heterogeneous and their applications continuously transmit transient information. Furthermore, Requesting, delivering and updating the information in IoT are challenging because of the resource limitation. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the latest and the most important Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approaches which uses named data to deliver data in the network. Based on hierarchically structured names, NDN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and uses its communication concept to optimize the power supply and distribute the data efficiently in the network. This paper discusses the main concepts of NDN including naming, routing, forwarding and caching in IoT infrastructure. To achieve an efficient system in different applications scenario in future IoT, an IoT architecture is proposed via NDN called IoT-NDN. The objective of this research work is the design and development of IoT-NDN for different fields in IoT systems. The deployment of IoT-NDN is challenging and requires proper design choices.

10.1109/WF-IoT48130.2020.9221446,Learner’s Dilemma: IoT Devices Training Strategies in Collaborative Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"With the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile edge computing, billions of smart devices are interconnected to develop applications used in various domains including smart homes, healthcare and smart manufacturing. Deep learning has been extensively utilized in various IoT applications which require huge amount of data for model training. Due to privacy requirements, smart IoT devices do not release data to a remote third party for their use. To overcome this problem, collaborative approach to deep learning, also known as Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) has been largely employed in data-driven applications. This approach enables multiple edge IoT devices to train their models locally on mobile edge devices. In this paper, we address IoT device training problem in CDL by analyzing the behavior of mobile edge devices using a game-theoretic model, where each mobile edge device aims at maximizing the accuracy of its local model at the same time limiting the overhead of participating in CDL. We analyze the Nash Equilibrium in an N-player static game model. We further present a novel clusterbased fair strategy to approximately solve the CDL game to enforce mobile edge devices for cooperation. Our experimental results and evaluation analysis in a real-world smart home deployment show that 80% mobile edge devices are ready to cooperate in CDL, while 20% of them do not train their local models collaboratively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9221446/,2020 IEEE 6th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),2-16 June 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/CVPR.2018.00664,Lose the Views: Limited Angle CT Reconstruction via Implicit Sinogram Completion,IEEE,Conferences,"Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction is a fundamental component to a wide variety of applications ranging from security, to healthcare. The classical techniques require measuring projections, called sinograms, from a full 180° view of the object. However, obtaining a full-view is not always feasible, such as when scanning irregular objects that limit flexibility of scanner rotation. The resulting limited angle sinograms are known to produce highly artifact-laden reconstructions with existing techniques. In this paper, we propose to address this problem using CTNet - a system of 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks, that operates directly on a limited angle sinogram to predict the reconstruction. We use the x-ray transform on this prediction to obtain a ""completed"" sinogram, as if it came from a full 180° view. We feed this to standard analytical and iterative reconstruction techniques to obtain the final reconstruction. We show with extensive experimentation on a challenging real world dataset that this combined strategy outperforms many competitive baselines. We also propose a measure of confidence for the reconstruction that enables a practitioner to gauge the reliability of a prediction made by CTNet. We show that this measure is a strong indicator of quality as measured by the PSNR, while not requiring ground truth at test time. Finally, using a segmentation experiment, we show that our reconstruction also preserves the 3D structure of objects better than existing solutions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8578762/,2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,18-23 June 2018,ieeexplore

The incident acoustic pressure most sensitive to ambient pressure fluctuations was determined; then the ambient pressure was tracked over 20 seconds. Regression analysis compared subharmonic and catheter pressure values. In vivo validation of this technique was performed noninvasively for tracking left ventricular (LV) pressures of two canines using similar post processing as in vitro.

Most of these insulin pump systems have limited security mechanisms embedded to protect them from malicious attacks. In this paper, two attacks against insulin pump systems via wireless links are investigated: a single acute overdose with a significant amount of medication, and chronic overdose with an insignificant amount of extra medication over a long time period, e.g., several months. These attacks can be launched unobtrusively and may jeopardize patients' lives. It is very important and urgent to protect patients from these attacks. To address this issue, we propose a novel patient infusion pattern based access control scheme (PIPAC) for wireless insulin pumps. This scheme employs a supervised learning approach to learn normal patient infusions pattern with the dosage amount, rate, and time of infusion, which are automatically recorded in insulin pump logs. The generated regression models are used to dynamically configure a safety infusion range for abnormal infusion identification. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with real insulin pump logs used by several patients for up to 6 months.

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.0-226,ReRe: A Lightweight Real-Time Ready-to-Go Anomaly Detection Approach for Time Series,IEEE,Conferences,"Anomaly detection is an active research topic in many different fields such as intrusion detection, network monitoring, system health monitoring, IoT healthcare, etc. However, many existing anomaly detection approaches require either human intervention or domain knowledge, and may suffer from high computation complexity, consequently hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Therefore, a lightweight and ready-to-go approach that is able to detect anomalies in real-time is highly sought-after. Such an approach could be easily and immediately applied to perform time series anomaly detection on any commodity machine. The approach could provide timely anomaly alerts and by that enable appropriate countermeasures to be undertaken as early as possible. With these goals in mind, this paper introduces ReRe, which is a Real-time Ready-to-go proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for streaming time series. ReRe employs two lightweight Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict and jointly determine whether or not an upcoming data point is anomalous based on short-term historical data points and two long-term self-adaptive thresholds. Our experiment based on real-world time-series datasets demonstrates the good performance of ReRe in real-time anomaly detection without requiring human intervention or domain knowledge.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202855/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

Towards the practical use, the recognition of activities of daily living (ADL) is an important step. Many studies of the ADL recognition have been conducted so far, for real-life and human-centric applications such as eldercare and healthcare. However, most existing methods have limitations in deployment cost, privacy exposure, and inconvenience for residents. To cope with the limitations, this paper presents a new indoor ADL recognition system especially for OPH. To minimize the deployment cost as well as the intrusions to user and house, we exploit an IoT-based environment-sensing device, called Autonomous Sensor Box (SensorBox) which can autonomously measure 7 kinds of environment attributes. We apply machine-learning techniques to the collected data, and predicts 7 kinds of ADLs. We conduct an experiment within an actual apartment of a single user. The result shows that the proposed system achieves the average accuracy of ADL recognition with more than 88%, by carefully developing the features of environment attributes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8022765/,"2017 18th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)",26-28 June 2017,ieeexplore

The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

However, the increased security incidents and leakage of patient data raise the concerns to address security risks and privacy issues of mhealth applications urgently. While recent mobile health applications that rely on password-based authentication cannot withstand password guessing and cracking attacks, several countermeasures such as One-Time Password (OTP), grid-based password, and biometric authentication have recently been implemented to protect mobile health applications. These countermeasures, however, can be thwarted by brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and persistent malware attacks. This paper proposed grid-based honey encryption by hybridising honey encryption with grid-based authentication. Compared to recent honey encryption limited in the hardening password attacks process, the proposed grid-based honey encryption can be further employed against shoulder surfing, smudge and replay attacks.

The key enabler to these applications is sensor-based human activity recognition; that is, recognising and analysing human daily activities from wearable and ambient sensors. With the power of machine learning we can recognise complex correlations between various types of sensor data and the activities being observed. However the challenges still remain: (1) they often rely on a large amount of labelled training data to build the model, and (2) they cannot dynamically adapt the model with emerging or changing activity patterns over time. To directly address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric model, i.e. Dirichlet process mixture of conditionally independent von Mises Fisher models, to enable both unsupervised and semi-supervised dynamic learning of human activities. The Bayesian nonparametric model can dynamically adapt itself to the evolving activity patterns without human intervention and the learning results can be used to alleviate the annotation effort.

The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device.

Many neurological diseases like paralysis are caused by the interruption of spike propagation due to the malfunctioning neurons in the signaling pathway where the spikes are carried. In this paper, we propose a neuron specific statistical multiplexing scheme to substitute a faulty sensory neural pathway with a neighboring functional one. Since the spikes are stereotyped events and they have no addressing information, we developed an addressing scheme utilizing the spikes themselves. The performance achieved by the proposed technique is analyzed in terms of the percentage of the spikes transmitted under various scenarios. We also compared the results obtained with the previously proposed TDMA based multiplexing schemes. The proposed statistical multiplexing based technique has lower implementation complexity than the previously introduced TDMA based techniques.

This opens up exciting new possibilities for applications in various domains including: education, training, healthcare, and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Recognizing physical objects in the environment provides contextual clues that can improve user task performance and influence effective cognitive load for complex tasks. However, this facet of MR is still relatively nascent because of hardware limitations. Presently, MR headsets can only detect physical surfaces; they can not distinguish between physical artifacts that a user might need in their work environment. Machine Learning (ML) based object recognition solutions can help overcome this limitation. However, current commercially available MR devices have insufficient computational capabilities and are unable to support the state-of-the-art ML based object recognition solutions. To address these challenges, we describe a novel approach and the corresponding framework by introducing a hardware level separation between the two tasks of object recognition and rendering virtual components. Our approach leverages ML based object recognition, MR, and a portable IoT edge computing platform to support contextual awareness. We describe the implementation of this approach and provide a case study. The prototype implementation uses an edge device to process and recognize objects to get information about the user’s physical environment and provides the user with situational awareness through the MR device. Our case study uses a Christmas tree decoration activity to demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to support assembly-type tasks.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136648/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

It can convert the innumerable raw day-to-day medical big data from massive IoT-based medical devices to diagnostic valuable data so that they can be feed to clinical routine. In this article, we propose a novel spatiotemporal two-streams generative adversarial network (SpGAN) as a cross-modality data processing approach to deploy the medical IoT in infarction learning. Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance. Real IoT-based remote diagnosis experiments performed on 230 patients demonstrate that SpGAN provides high-quality converted images for infarction learning and promotes the in-depth application and deployment of IoT in the medical field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386256/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to offer defense solutions that increase the robustness of DNNs against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel defense solution based on a Deep Denoising Sparse Autoencoder (DDSA). The proposed method is performed as a pre-processing step, where the adversarial noise of the input samples is removed before feeding the classifier. The pre-processing defense block can be associated with any classifier, without any change to their architecture or training procedure. In addition, the proposed method is a universal defense, since it does not require any knowledge about the attack, making it usable against any type of attack.

Current security mechanisms detect insider threats, but they are ill-suited to monitor systems in which users function in dynamic teams. In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors. When the number of illicit users is low, MetaCADS is the best model, but as the number grows, commonly accessed semantics lead to hiding in a crowd, such that CADS is more prudent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6133296/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,May-June 2012,ieeexplore

A subset of medical algorithms referring to MCP solving concerns well-known medical problems and their computational algorithmic solutions. These solutions result from computations within mathematical models aiming to enhance healthcare quality via support for diagnosis and treatment automation, especially useful for educational purposes. Currently, there is a plethora of computational algorithms on the web, which pertain to MCPs and provide all computational facilities required to solve a medical problem. An inherent requirement for the successful construction of algorithmic pathways for managing real medical cases is the composition of a sequence of computational algorithms. The aim of this paper is to approach the composition of such pathways via the design of appropriate finite-state machines (FSMs), the use of ontologies, and SWRL semantic rules. The goal of semantic rules is to automatically associate different algorithms that are represented as different states of the FSM in order to result in a successful pathway. The rule-based approach is herein implemented on top of Knowledge-Based System for Intelligent Computational Search in Medicine (KnowBaSICS-M), an ontology-based system for MCP semantic management.

Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs. However, there is a shortage of visible work that focus on early-stage risk prediction of these diseases. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based health CPS framework that addresses the challenge of effectively processing the wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diabetes as an example of NCDs. In the experiment, a verified diabetic dataset has been used for training, while the testing has been performed on an artificially generated data collection from sensors.

Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: (1) physiological feature extraction; (2) statistical-based feature selection; and (3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence. The new algorithm may serve as an effective method for future service robot real-time detection of patient emotional states and behavior adaptation to promote positive healthcare experiences.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6301777/,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,Jan. 2013,ieeexplore

In many domains such as medicine and healthcare, interpretability is one of the most important factors when considering the adoption of those models. In this paper, we propose a two-stage binary classification system applicable for healthcare (or general) data that benefits from a high level of interpretability and can at the same time achieve the results comparable to commonly used classification techniques. The motivation behind the proposed system is the lack of effective classification methods for handling data generated by various distributions (such as healthcare or banking data) that can harmonize both performance and interpretability perspectives. In this work, we tackle the problem by applying divide and conquer strategy on a new disentangled representation of the underlying data.

Cloud-centric processing approaches for the IoT data suffer from high and unpredictable network latency, which causes poor experience in real-time IoT applications, such as healthcare. To address this issue, in edge computing, the data inference starts from the data source (i.e., the IoT devices). However, the constrained computational capabilities of the IoT device and the power-hungry data transmission demand a tradeoff between onboard processing and computation offloading. Hence, the IoT information inference requires efficient and lightweight techniques that are tailored for this tradeoff and respect the constrained resources on IoT devices, such as wearables. This article presents a hierarchical classification approach that decomposes the problem into three classifiers in two hierarchy layers. In the first layer, a lightweight classifier executes directly on the IoT device and decides whether to offload the computation to the gateway or to perform it onboard. The second layer comprises a lightweight classifier on the IoT device (can only distinguish a subset of classes) and a complex classifier on the gateway (to distinguish the remaining classes).

The system is composed of inertial measurement units, a station for the real-time processing (smartphone/tablet/PC), dedicated algorithms and, eventually, a headphone for auditory feedback. An auditory feedback can warn the patient about particularly dangerous situations as the freezing of gait in the case of Parkinsonian patients, and timely provide rhythmic auditory stimulations to release the gait block. Two different hard and soft implementations of the system are discussed in this paper. The first has just one sensor in a headset. This solution features a fine detection of body motion and in particular of trunk oscillations, easy wearability, through auditory feedback. It is particularly compact and energy efficient, since no wired/wireless connection is required to give the audio-feedback (which reflects on the battery life).

Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and all data is taken from historical EMR databases and reflects the kinds of data that would realistically be available at the clinical prediction system in hospitals. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. For example, using the general hospital wards data for 30-day readmission prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for the proposed model was 0.70, significantly higher than all the baseline methods. Based on these results, a system is being deployed in hospital settings with the proposed forecasting algorithms to support treatment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338085/,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,1 Nov.-Dec. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems. It is conjectured that, potentially, the method could be extended to determine risks associated with the deployment of intelligent medical systems in clinical practice.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/846690/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,July 2000,ieeexplore

However, currently, the CABAN paradigm in the healthcare domain is facing increasing difficulty in handling the huge amount of sensor data that the body sensor devices generate from diverse Smart home applications. Therefore, the challenging is now timely storing, processing, and analyzing of the sensor data in real time to maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the caregivers or Smart home applications. QoS, here, is the capacity to support diverse Smart home applications in healthcare with different priorities, performance, and resource requirements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a fast and robust cloud resource allocation model for body sensor devices to ensure QoS for Smart home healthcare applications. We develop the proposed resource allocation algorithm using agent-based modeling (ABM) and ontology. There are few works, which consider ABM and ontology for resource allocation in CABAN platform.

Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture.

10.1109/TKDE.2007.1042,Sensor-Based Abnormal Human-Activity Detection,IEEE,Journals,"With the availability of affordable sensors and sensor networks, sensor-based human activity recognition has attracted much attention in artificial intelligence and ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we present a novel two-phase approach for detecting abnormal activities based on wireless sensors attached to a human body. Detecting abnormal activities is a particular important task in security monitoring and healthcare applications of sensor networks, among many others. Traditional approaches to this problem suffer from a high false positive rate, particularly when the collected sensor data are biased towards normal data while the abnormal events are rare. Therefore, there is a lack of training data for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem, our approach first employs a one-class support vector machine (SVM) that is trained on commonly available normal activities, which filters out the activities that have a very high probability of being normal. We then derive abnormal activity models from a general normal model via a kernel nonlinear regression (KNLR) to reduce false positive rate in an unsupervised manner. We show that our approach provides a good tradeoff between abnormality detection rate and false alarm rate, and allows abnormal activity models to be automatically derived without the need to explicitly label the abnormal training data, which are scarce. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real data collected from a sensor network that is deployed in a realistic setting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4358934/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,Aug. 2008,ieeexplore

In a typical scenario of telesurgery, surgical tasks are performed with one surgeon situated at the patient's side and one expert surgeon from a remote site. In order to make telesurgery practice realistic and secure, reliable transmission of medical videos over large distances is essential. However, telesurgery videos that are communicated remotely in real time are vulnerable to distortions in signals due to data compression and transmission. Depending on the system and its applications, visual content received by the surgeons differs in perceived quality, which may incur implications for the performance of telesurgery tasks. To rigorously study the assessment of the quality of telesurgery videos, we performed both qualitative and quantitative research, consisting of semi-structured interviews and video quality scoring with human subjects. Statistical analyses are conducted and results show that compression artifacts and transmission errors significantly affect the perceived quality; and the effects tend to depend on the specific surgical procedure, visual content, frame rate, and the degree of distortion.

As this consolidation gets stronger, the need for security in IoT increases. With first line of defense strategies like cryptography being unsuited due to the resource constrained nature, second line of defense mechanisms are crucial to ensure security in IoT networks. This paper presents a comprehensive study of existing second line of defense mechanisms for standardized protocols in IoT networks.

10.1109/TASE.2021.3054741,Transferring Subject-Specific Knowledge Across Stimulus Frequencies in SSVEP-Based BCIs,IEEE,Journals,"Learning from subject's calibration data can significantly improve the performance of a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI), for example, the state-of-the-art target recognition methods utilize the learned subject-specific and stimulus-specific model parameters. Unfortunately, when dealing with new stimuli or new subjects, new calibration data must be acquired, thus requiring laborious calibration sessions, which becomes a major challenge in developing high-performance BCIs for real-life applications. This study investigates the feasibility of transferring the model parameters (i.e., the spatial filters and the SSVEP templates) across two different groups of visual stimuli in SSVEP-based BCIs. According to our exploration, we can extract a common spatial filter from the spatial filters across different stimulus frequencies and a common impulse response from the SSVEP templates across different neighboring stimulus frequencies, in which the common spatial filter is considered as the transferred spatial filter and the common impulse response is utilized to reconstruct the transferred SSVEP template according to the theory that an SSVEP is a superposition of the impulse responses. Then, we develop a transfer learning canonical correlation analysis (tlCCA) incorporating the transferred model parameters. For evaluation, we compare the recognition performance of the calibration-free, the calibration-based, and the proposed tlCCA on an SSVEP data set with 60 subjects. Experiment results prove that the spatial filters share commonality across different frequencies and the impulse responses share commonality across neighboring frequencies. More importantly, the tlCCA performs significantly better than the calibration-free algorithms, comparably to the calibration-based algorithm. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the long calibration time problem in using an steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) because most state-of-the-art frequency recognition methods consider merely the situation that the calibration data and the test data are from the same subject and the same visual stimulus. This article assumes that the model parameters share the stimulus-nonspecific knowledge in a limited stimulus frequency range, and thus, the subject's old calibration data can be reused to learn new model parameters for new visual stimuli. First, the model parameters can be decomposed into the stimulus-nonspecific knowledge (or subject-specific knowledge) and stimulus-specific knowledge. Second, the new model parameters can be generated via transferring the knowledge across stimulus frequencies. Then, a new recognition algorithm is developed using the transferred model parameters. Experiment results validate the assumptions, and moreover, the proposed scheme could be extended to other scenarios, such as when facing new subjects, or adopting new signal acquisition equipment, which would be helpful to the future development of zero-calibration SSVEP-based BCIs for real-life healthcare applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9354064/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,April 2021,ieeexplore

The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore

Fall detection is the most important health care issue for the elderly. In computer vision domain, significant breakthrough technologies such as deep learning have been obtained for over five years. Deep learning belongs to computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from training data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a specific type of deep learning, have set the state-of-the-art image classification performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in recent years. In this paper, we present the use of convolutional neural networks for fall detection in video surveillance environment. CNN is directly applied to each frame image in the video to learn human shape deformation features that describe different postures of the human and determine if a fall occurs.

Most existing pill recognition models are limited in tackling this challenging few-shot learning problem due to the insufficient instances per category. With limited training data, neural network-based models have limitations in discovering most discriminating features, or going deeper. Especially, existing models fail to handle the hard samples taken under less controlled imaging conditions. In this study, a new pill image database, namely CURE, is first developed with more varied imaging conditions and instances for each pill category. Secondly, a W2-net is proposed for better pill segmentation. Thirdly, a Multi-Stream (MS) deep network that captures task-related features along with a novel two-stage training methodology are proposed. Within the proposed framework, a Batch All strategy that considers all the samples is first employed for the sub-streams, and then a Batch Hard strategy that considers only the hard samples mined in the first stage is utilized for the fusion network. By doing so, complex samples that could not be represented by one type of feature could be focused and the model could be forced to exploit other domain-related information more effectively. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the National Institute of Health (NIH) and our CURE database.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157392/,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),13-19 June 2020,ieeexplore

Among many localization algorithms, range-free localization is more preferable because of its cost and implementation efficiency. Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms.

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients.

Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the compute-intensive feature extraction stage done right at the output of the camera to extract and transfer only action feature in multi-camera network setting and hence reduce network bandwidth requirement. In this work, we first evaluate the possibility to perform feature extraction under reduced precision fixed-point arithmetic to ease hardware resource requirements. We compared the Histogram of Oriented Gradient in 3D (HOG3D) feature extraction with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods and shown the later to be 75× slower than the former.

Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification.

Although many suffer from depression/low mood, they hesitate to undergo clinical check-ups. Therefore, a systematic and efficient web-based system that automatically detects emotions is necessary. The purpose of this study was to design and develop a system that can automatically detect negative and positive mood states and to investigate the relationship between the depression and mood states of individuals. User's facial expressions features are detected and analyzed in real-time and after the completion of using the system, the determined emotion is hence provided to the users. A facial depression model constructed from a dataset obtained in a human-agent interaction (HAI) experiment was applied to a general human-computer interaction (HCI) situation to classify negative and positive mood states. The model exhibits the highest accuracy rate for classifying mood states. These findings suggest that faces provide strong evidence of mood induction to depression and guidance to construct the automatic mental health care web-based system to know the preliminary mental state.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9302670/,2020 International Conference on Pervasive Artificial Intelligence (ICPAI),3-5 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Big-data processing and AI algorithms are at the heart of autonomics research groups among industry and academia. Major advances in the field have traditionally focused on algorithmic research and increasing the performance of the developed algorithms. However, it has been recently recognized by the AI community that the applicability of these algorithms and their consideration in context is of paramount importance for their adoption. Current approaches to address AI in context lie in two areas: adaptive systems research that mainly focuses on implementing adaptivity mechanisms (technical perspective) and AI in context research that focuses on business aspects (business perspective). There is currently no approach that combines all aspects required from business considerations to an appropriate level of abstraction. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of designing adaptive systems and therefore providing AI in context by utilising DSL technology. We propose a new DSL (<italic>AdaptiveSystems</italic>) and a methodology to apply this to the creation of a DSL for specific application domains such as <italic>AdaptiveVLE (Adaptive Virtual Learning Environment)</italic> DSL.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094354/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces.

The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices.

Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore

Fall detection is the most important health care issue for the elderly. In computer vision domain, significant breakthrough technologies such as deep learning have been obtained for over five years. Deep learning belongs to computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from training data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a specific type of deep learning, have set the state-of-the-art image classification performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in recent years. In this paper, we present the use of convolutional neural networks for fall detection in video surveillance environment. CNN is directly applied to each frame image in the video to learn human shape deformation features that describe different postures of the human and determine if a fall occurs.

Most existing pill recognition models are limited in tackling this challenging few-shot learning problem due to the insufficient instances per category. With limited training data, neural network-based models have limitations in discovering most discriminating features, or going deeper. Especially, existing models fail to handle the hard samples taken under less controlled imaging conditions. In this study, a new pill image database, namely CURE, is first developed with more varied imaging conditions and instances for each pill category. Secondly, a W2-net is proposed for better pill segmentation. Thirdly, a Multi-Stream (MS) deep network that captures task-related features along with a novel two-stage training methodology are proposed. Within the proposed framework, a Batch All strategy that considers all the samples is first employed for the sub-streams, and then a Batch Hard strategy that considers only the hard samples mined in the first stage is utilized for the fusion network. By doing so, complex samples that could not be represented by one type of feature could be focused and the model could be forced to exploit other domain-related information more effectively. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on both the National Institute of Health (NIH) and our CURE database.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9157392/,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),13-19 June 2020,ieeexplore

Among many localization algorithms, range-free localization is more preferable because of its cost and implementation efficiency. Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms.

At present health kiosks are deployed in remote villages and basic health data like blood pressure, pulse rate, height-weight, BMI, Oxygen saturation level(SpO<sub>2</sub>), body temperature are collected by the health workers. Common problems, like cold, diarrhoea are either interpreted by the health workers based on the data and interaction with the patients or waiting for the availability of the doctors, which happens rarely. Due to limited knowledge of the health workers and measurement error of sensor data different types of uncertainties appear in the dataset, resulting inaccurate primary health care to the rural patients.

Moreover, it is highly desirable to have the compute-intensive feature extraction stage done right at the output of the camera to extract and transfer only action feature in multi-camera network setting and hence reduce network bandwidth requirement. In this work, we first evaluate the possibility to perform feature extraction under reduced precision fixed-point arithmetic to ease hardware resource requirements. We compared the Histogram of Oriented Gradient in 3D (HOG3D) feature extraction with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods and shown the later to be 75× slower than the former.

Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification.

Although many suffer from depression/low mood, they hesitate to undergo clinical check-ups. Therefore, a systematic and efficient web-based system that automatically detects emotions is necessary. The purpose of this study was to design and develop a system that can automatically detect negative and positive mood states and to investigate the relationship between the depression and mood states of individuals. User's facial expressions features are detected and analyzed in real-time and after the completion of using the system, the determined emotion is hence provided to the users. A facial depression model constructed from a dataset obtained in a human-agent interaction (HAI) experiment was applied to a general human-computer interaction (HCI) situation to classify negative and positive mood states. The model exhibits the highest accuracy rate for classifying mood states. These findings suggest that faces provide strong evidence of mood induction to depression and guidance to construct the automatic mental health care web-based system to know the preliminary mental state.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9302670/,2020 International Conference on Pervasive Artificial Intelligence (ICPAI),3-5 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Big-data processing and AI algorithms are at the heart of autonomics research groups among industry and academia. Major advances in the field have traditionally focused on algorithmic research and increasing the performance of the developed algorithms. However, it has been recently recognized by the AI community that the applicability of these algorithms and their consideration in context is of paramount importance for their adoption. Current approaches to address AI in context lie in two areas: adaptive systems research that mainly focuses on implementing adaptivity mechanisms (technical perspective) and AI in context research that focuses on business aspects (business perspective). There is currently no approach that combines all aspects required from business considerations to an appropriate level of abstraction. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of designing adaptive systems and therefore providing AI in context by utilising DSL technology. We propose a new DSL (<italic>AdaptiveSystems</italic>) and a methodology to apply this to the creation of a DSL for specific application domains such as <italic>AdaptiveVLE (Adaptive Virtual Learning Environment)</italic> DSL.

Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094354/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the potential benefits and the relevance of real world studies (RWS) with to the rapid development of data mining algorithms, as well as large-scale accumulated real world datasets. However, it is beyond the ability of traditional data mining algorithms to solve such large-scale RWS problems due to the large amount of data need to be processed and the difficulty in the problems solving, especially the nonconvex optimization problems. In many cases for these nonconvex problems, the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that the iterative updates are easily trapped in saddle points or bad local optima points. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the sum of a smooth nonlinear function and a block-separable nonconvex function involving a large number of block variables subjected to inequality constraints, which covers a wide range of interesting applications appearing in distributed optimization, statistics learning, etc. However, solving such a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem associated with inequality constraints remains as a challenging task. This is because: 1) it is still an open problem about how to escape from saddle points and bad local optima points using a block coordinate descent method to deal with the nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions; 2) it can be extremely expensive to compute the entire block variables when the problem scale is large. Therefore, we propose a novel parallel first-order optimization method, called as Asynchronous block coordinate descent with Time Perturbation (ATP), which utilizing the time perturbation technique that escapes from saddle points and local optima points. We present a randomized block variable selection rule of the proposed method, as well as the iteration complexity. Experiments conducted on typical machine learning problems in RWS, i.e., folded concave linear regression, validate the efficacy of our optimization method. In particular, the experiment results demonstrate that time perturbation could greatly help the proposed algorithm escape from saddle points and local optima in the nonconvex part, which provides a promising way to tackle nonconvex optimization problems employing block coordinate descent.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8855671/,2019 IEEE 21st International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 17th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 5th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),10-12 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489062,Dynamic Human Gait VGRF Reference Profile Generation via Extreme Learning Machine,IEEE,Conferences,"Vertical Ground Reaction Forces (VGRF) reference profiles of human gait are important in medicine, for the recognition of gait disorders and in the assessment of rehabilitation treatments. A walking human is a dynamic varying system and in spite of the VGRF reference dependence on several patient's variables, doctors traditionally use the same static reference for all patients. The purpose of this study is to find out if an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adequate to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profiles of healthy people depending on the subject's age, weight, height and stride duration. The ELM is compared with two other baseline Computational Intelligence (CI) methods, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BNN) and Multioutput Support Vector Regression (MSVR). Data from 28 healthy males walking at five different stride durations, collected using instrumented shoes, were used to train and test the CI models. The results showed that ELM is a well suited method to generate the dynamic VGRF reference profile for both dominant and non-dominant limbs, showing the lowest root mean square errors for the test set, 0.0201 and 0.0243 (fraction of body weight) for the dominant and non-dominant limbs respectively. This study reveals a promising methodology that can be implemented in real time gait analysis, allowing doctors to find a specific reference gait pattern for the gait analysis of an unhealthy person by specifying the age, weight, height and stride duration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8489062/,2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),8-13 July 2018,ieeexplore

In this paper, we propose the use of empirical predictive analytics as a security management tool in virtualised environments, as a novel contribution to security for virtualization in cloud computing. The proposed predictive analytics model is aimed at monitoring and analysing security threats unique to virtualisation in real time, providing us with the ability to mitigate these security threats before they actually happen.

Sparse representation of data is one giant leap toward the search for a solution for big data analysis. The focus of our paper is on algorithms for sparsity-based representation of categorical data. For this, we adopt a concept from the image and signal processing domain called dictionary learning. We have successfully implemented its sparse coding stage which gives the sparse representation of data using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms (both Batch and Cholesky based) and its dictionary update stage using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We have also used a preprocessing stage where we represent the categorical dataset using a vector space model based on the TF-IDF weighting scheme. Our paper demonstrates how input data can be decomposed and approximated as a linear combination of minimum number of elementary columns of a dictionary which so formed will be a compact representation of data.

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax.

Currently, there is a plethora of computational algorithms on the web, which pertain to MCPs and provide all computational facilities required to solve a medical problem.

Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: (1) physiological feature extraction; (2) statistical-based feature selection; and (3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence.

Simulating processes that aim at collecting experimental data is crucial for multiple real-life applications, including nuclear medicine, astronomy, and high energy physics. Contemporary methods, such as Monte Carlo algorithms, provide high-fidelity results at a price of high computational cost. Multiple attempts are taken to reduce this burden, e.g. using generative approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks or Variational Autoencoders. Although such methods are much faster, they are often unstable in training and do not allow sampling from an entire data distribution. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel method dubbed end-to-end Sinkhorn Autoencoder, that leverages the Sinkhorn algorithm to explicitly align distribution of encoded real data examples and generated noise. More precisely, we extend autoencoder architecture by adding a deterministic neural network trained to map noise from a known distribution onto autoencoder latent space representing data distribution. We optimise the entire model jointly. Our method outperforms co mpeting approaches on a challenging dataset of simulation data from Zero Degree Calorimeters of ALICE experiment in LHC. as well as standard benchmarks, such as MNIST and CelebA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9311504/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001428,GSIC: A New Interpretable System for Knowledge Exploration and Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Machine learning and data mining techniques have been developed rapidly in recent times. In tasks such as classification, machine learning techniques have been shown to equal to and even surpass human performance. However, high performance models are usually complex, opaque and have low interpretability thus making it difficult to explain the underlying behaviors of those models that lead to the final outcomes. In many domains such as medicine and healthcare, interpretability is one of the most important factors when considering the adoption of those models. In this paper, we propose a two-stage binary classification system applicable for healthcare (or general) data that benefits from a high level of interpretability and can at the same time achieve the results comparable to commonly used classification techniques. The motivation behind the proposed system is the lack of effective classification methods for handling data generated by various distributions (such as healthcare or banking data) that can harmonize both performance and interpretability perspectives. In this work, we tackle the problem by applying divide and conquer strategy on a new disentangled representation of the underlying data. The merit of our system is evaluated by a classification experiment with a wide range of real data and popular transparent and black-box models. Furthermore, a use case in data of sepsis patients staying in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) is depicted to prove the interpretability of the proposed model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9113307/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

As an example, a hospital service robot is told to deliver medicine to Patient Two in Ward Three. Without awareness of what “Patient Two” or “Ward Three” is, a service robot must systematically explore the environment to perform this task, which requires a long time. The implementation of a Semantic Map allows for robots to perceive the environment similar to people by associating semantic information with spatial information found in geometric maps. Currently, many semantic mapping works provide insufficient or incorrect semantic-metric information to allow a service robot to function dynamically in human-centric environments. This paper proposes a semantic map with a hierarchical semantic organization structure based on a hybrid metric-topological map leveraging convolutional neural networks and spatial room segmentation methods. Our results are validated using multiple simulated and real environments on our lab's custom developed mobile service robot and demonstrate an application of semantic maps by providing only vocal commands.

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set. Experimental results show that our model's predictive ability is better than the best models available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9138732/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

Methods: The risk scoring system is based on the idea of sequential hypothesis testing under an uncertain time horizon. The system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g., age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results: Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6321 patients admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our score significantly outperforms the currently deployed risk scores, such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE, and SOFA scores, in terms of timeliness, true positive rate, and positive predictive value. Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients' heterogeneity.

10.1109/4233.735786,Real-time separation of discontinuous adventitious sounds from vesicular sounds using a fuzzy rule-based filter,IEEE,Journals,"The separation of pathological discontinuous adventitious sounds (DAS) from vesicular sounds (VS) is of great importance to the analysis of lung sounds since DAS are related to certain pulmonary pathologies. An automated way of revealing the diagnostic character of DAS, by isolating them from VS, based on their nonstationarity, is presented. The proposed algorithm uses two adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems to compose a generalized fuzzy rule-based stationary-nonstationary filter (GFST-NST). The training procedure of the fuzzy inference systems involves the outputs of the wavelet transform-based stationary-nonstationary filter (WTST-NST), proposed by Hadjileontiadis and Panas (1997). The basic idea of the GFST-NST was initially proposed by the authors with the introduction of the fuzzy rule-based stationary-nonstationary filter (FST-NST) (1997), tested with the separation of crackles from VS. The main contribution of this paper is the modification of the structure of the FST-NST filter to a serial-type fuzzy filter that, unlike the parallel operation of the FST-NST filter, sends a predicted stationary signal (VS) into the predictor of the nonstationary (DAS). Applying the GFST-NST filter to fine-coarse crackles and squawks, selected from three lung sound databases, the coherent structure of DAS is revealed and they are separated from VS. The separation performance of the GFST-NST filter was evaluated through quantitative and qualitative indexes that proved its efficiency and superiority against the FST-NST filter. When compared to the WTST-NST filter, the GFST-NST filter performed similarly in accuracy and objectiveness, but in a faster way. Thus, the GFST-NST filter combines the separation accuracy of the WTST-NST filter with the real-time implementation of the FST-NST filter, so it can easily be used in clinical medicine as a module of an integrated intelligent patient evaluation system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/735786/,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,Sept. 1998,ieeexplore
10.1109/10.846690,Receiver operating characteristic analysis for intelligent medical systems-a new approach for finding confidence intervals,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent systems are increasingly being deployed in medicine and healthcare, but there is a need for a robust and objective methodology for evaluating such systems. Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows.

VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets.

Incremental learning proves to be time as well as resource-efficient solution for deployment of deep learning algorithms in real world as the model can automatically and dynamically adapt to new data as and when annotated data becomes available. The development and deployment of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools in medical domain is another scenario, where incremental learning becomes very crucial as collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset spanning over multiple pathologies and imaging machines might take years. However, not much has so far been explored in this direction. In the current work, we propose a robust and efficient method for incremental learning in medical imaging domain.

10.1109/CNS48642.2020.9162311,HEKA: A Novel Intrusion Detection System for Attacks to Personal Medical Devices,IEEE,Conferences,"Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162311/,2020 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),29 June-1 July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

As the idea of the paper we put two questions: 1. Can individual instances of real high-tech medical images work as AE when being analyzed with the use of neural networks? 2. Is it possible to defend oneself against such ""natural"" adversarial attacks with the simplest possible means? In our research, we tried the following defence methods: adversarial training, Gaussian data augmentation and bounded RELU (see section 3 for a detailed description). We conducted the experiment with the use of the neural network - a variant of convolutional network structure combining U-Net with the region proposal networks. As the source data two datasets were chosen - the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection containing 1018 lung cancer screening thoracic CT scans and Brain MRI DataSet containing clinical imaging data of glioma patients (a total of 274 cases). The experiments showed that the degree of manifestation of AE varies depending on the type of training model. When training a model not using techniques of defences on adversarial examples, the number of incorrectly recognized images is quite large (200 per 10,000 for CT and 285 per 10,000 for MRI). By proper selecting of the activation function of CNN, it can be reduced to 60 and 68, respectively. With augmentation of training dataset by Gaussian noised images, this number drops to 21 and 26. An even greater reduction in the number of incorrectly recognized images is achieved using the Adversarial Training method -12 and 15. Thus, it is shown that the adversarial effect is possible after the application of adversarial training techniques, but the degree of noise in such an image will be much higher than before using these techniques, and it will be easy enough for the doctor to recognize them visually and exclude them from further consideration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8711974/,2019 24th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),8-12 April 2019,ieeexplore

Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images.

By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required. A machine-learning algorithm was conducted to perform the classification process. Four experiments were carried out to classify sickle cell disease patients from normal patients using machine-learning algorithm in which 99.5984% classification accuracy was achieved using Multi-layer perceptron. Classification using Core Vector Regression, Hyper Pipes and Zero-Rule based algorithms achieved classification accuracy of 95.9839 %, 87.9518% and 70.6827 %, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7363123/,"2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing",26-28 Oct. 2015,ieeexplore

However, in practical deployment scenarios, many such methods are sensitive to the outliers present in the imperfectly-curated training sets. Current robust methods use heuristics for model fitting or lack formulations to leverage even a small amount of high-quality expert feedback. In contrast, we propose a novel method combining (i) robust statistical modeling, extending the multivariate generalized-Gaussian to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with (ii) semi-supervised learning to leverage a small expert-labeled outlier set.

This article analyze the power of AO as data mining tools applied on databases collected in several medical intervention domains, with the aim of verify their real effectiveness, compared with the regression models and the standard ANN models, in processing such kind of complex real-world data. These tools have been applied by the authors in independent applications on nineteen analyses carried out on thirteen databases collected in five main medical domains. The performance obtained by the ANNs coupled with AO shows a systematic significant increase in terms of the overall accuracy, compared with both the traditional statistic methods (linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and the Standard ANNs. The added value of AO over standard ANNs consisted in an average increase in overall accuracy of about 10% ( from 77.59% to 88.07% respectively), bringing to a 16 % difference versus classical statistics models. This increase in predictive capacity was obtained with an average 50% ""intelligent"" reduction of the input variables.

The first stage is a self-organizing principal components analysis (SOPCA) network that is used to project the feature vector onto its leading principal axes found by using principal components analysis. This step provides an effective basis for feature extraction. The second stage consists of a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) which will automatically cluster the input vector into different regions. The optimum number of regions (clusters) is obtained by a model fitting approach. Finally, a 3D connected component labeling algorithm is applied to ensure region connectivity.

In this paper we test the hypothesis that the application of machine learning techniques on data of this nature can be used to address prediction/forecasting problems in the Health IT domain. The novelty of this approach consists in that medical data (test results, diagnoses, doctors' notes etc.) are not included in the predictors' dataset. Moreover, there is limited need for separation of patient cohorts based on specific health conditions. Methods: We experiment with the prediction of the probability of early readmission at the time of a patient's discharge. We extract real HIS data and perform data processing techniques. We then apply a series of machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Deep Multilayer Neural Network) and measure the performance of the emergent models.

The core focus of this algorithm is to explore the effectiveness of MV information embedding in learning models and viable implementation in real-time applications. Our method is capable of incorporating high-dimensional information inherent in MV features generated from available inputs using the proposed DCA-based scheme.

It allows for a real time implementation, in the sense that corrected data flows out of the circuit at the same rate that input data is fed into it.

It can convert the innumerable raw day-to-day medical big data from massive IoT-based medical devices to diagnostic valuable data so that they can be feed to clinical routine. In this article, we propose a novel spatiotemporal two-streams generative adversarial network (SpGAN) as a cross-modality data processing approach to deploy the medical IoT in infarction learning. Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance. Real IoT-based remote diagnosis experiments performed on 230 patients demonstrate that SpGAN provides high-quality converted images for infarction learning and promotes the in-depth application and deployment of IoT in the medical field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386256/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore

We address these problems by a U-Net-like architecture consisting of bidirectional convolutional long short-term memory and convolutional, pooling, upsampling, and concatenation layers enclosed into time-distributed wrappers.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October 2019.

Currently, there is a plethora of computational algorithms on the web, which pertain to MCPs and provide all computational facilities required to solve a medical problem. An inherent requirement for the successful construction of algorithmic pathways for managing real medical cases is the composition of a sequence of computational algorithms. The aim of this paper is to approach the composition of such pathways via the design of appropriate finite-state machines (FSMs), the use of ontologies, and SWRL semantic rules. The goal of semantic rules is to automatically associate different algorithms that are represented as different states of the FSM in order to result in a successful pathway.

We introduce the unconditionally stable semiimplicit linearized difference scheme that is fashioned after additive operator split (AOS) [Weickert, J. et al.

For gray-level images, we show that the flow equation can be arranged in an advection-diffusion form, revealing the edge-enhancing properties of this flow. This also suggests the application of AOS method for faster convergence. The subjective surface [Sarti, A. et al.

However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required. We first show that the governing equation for the subjective surface flow can be rearranged in an AOS implementation, providing a near real-time solution to the shape completion problem in 2D and 3D.

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs).

Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds.

This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model.

Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0275,4D subharmonic imaging in vivo,IEEE,Conferences,"Subharmonic imaging (SHI) improves the isolation of ultrasound contrast agent signals from the surrounding tissue signals by transmitting at f<sub>0</sub> and receiving at f<sub>0</sub>/2. In this study we investigated the feasibility of generating real-time 3D (i.e., 4D) SHI volumes. Four-dimensional SHI (f<sub>0</sub> = 5.8 MHz, transmitting 4 cycle pulses) was implemented on a Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner with a mechanically controlled 4D10L probe (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Experimental software provided access to both individual slice data and rendered images. This software also allowed imaging in B-mode (at 10 MHz) and harmonic imaging (HI; f<sub>0</sub> = 5 MHz, f<sub>receive</sub>= 10 MHz). Two canines received 5 μl/kg bolus injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N Billerica, MA) for HI and 20 μl/kg bolus for SHI of the lower renal pole. The contrast-to-tissue ratio was then calculated for three injections in each canine and compared between modes. Patients scheduled for biopsy of a mammographically identified breast lesion provided informed consent. Baseline scanning was performed in both B-mode and power Doppler. Patients then received a 0.25 ml bolus of Definity for HI followed by a bolus injection of 20 μl/kg for SHI. Baseline 2D cine loops, 3D slice data and rendered volumes were saved for off-line comparison. While scan volumes varied, a volume of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm acquired at a 19° volume angle resulted in 45-50 slices per volume at an acquisition rate of 1.8 to 2.2 Hz depending on depth. In the canine model, SHI resulted in significant improvement in contrast visualization and rendered SHI images demonstrated superior tissue suppression and a greater overall view of renal vasculature. In breast lesions, enhancement varied greatly on a case by case basis. However, SHI resulted in improved tissue suppression and detection of contrast in almost all cases.

Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been acknowledged as one of the most effective data level solutions, but often suffers from the drawback of overfitting due to uniform oversampling rate. The ensemble learning techniques have recently emerged as effective; but can yield best results when integrated with data level solutions.

Increasing fall events require high service quality and dedicated medical treatment which is an economic burden. In the lack of appropriate care and support, serious injuries caused by fall will cost lives. Therefore, tracking systems with fall detection capabilities are required. Static-view sensors with machine learning techniques for human fall detection have been widely studied and achieved significant results. However, these systems unable to monitor a person if he or she is out of viewing angle which greatly impedes its performance. Mobile robots are an alternative for keeping the person in sight. However, existing mobile robots are unable to operate for a long time due to battery issues and movement constraints in complex environments.

Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset.

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets.

Dysfunction of heart function even for a couple of moments can be fatal, therefore, efficient monitoring of its physiological state is essential for the patients with cardiovascular diseases. In the recent past, various computer assisted medical imaging systems have been proposed for the segmentation of the organ of interest. However, for the segmentation of heart using MRI, only few methods have been proposed each with its own merits and demerits. For further advancement in this area of research, we analyze automated heart segmentation methods for magnetic resonance images. The analysis are based on deep learning methods that processes a full MR scan in a slice by slice fashion to predict desired mask for heart region. We design two encoder-decoder type fully convolutional neural network models (1) Multi-Channel input scheme (also known as 2.5D method), (2) a single channel input scheme with relatively large size network. Both models are evaluated on real MRI dataset and their performances are analysed for different test samples on standard measures such as Jaccard score, Youden's index and Dice score etc. Python implementation of our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Shak97/iceest2019 for performance evaluation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9024793/,"2019 13th International Conference on Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Computer Science and Statistics (MACS)",14-15 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/NNSP.1999.788166,A comparative study of a hidden Markov model detector for atrial fibrillation,IEEE,Conferences,"A comparative study of several atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithms was done to determine the algorithm best suited for use in real clinical environments to detect AF in ambulatory ECGs. The algorithms that were investigated for this paper are based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), measures of variance, linear predictive coding, and measurement of approximate entropy (AE). Based on the results from the test data set, the HMM algorithm performed best for this application. In general, there is little difference between the performance of the HMM and AE algorithms. However, the implementation of the HMM algorithm is more computationally efficient. Because of the large amount of data that must be analyzed in ambulatory ECG recordings, the computational efficiency must be considered as an issue of practicality. Review of the data illuminated some of the strengths and weaknesses of the various algorithms. Variance measures performed with either high sensitivity or high positive predictivity, but were not able to achieve a desirable operating point that had both acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity. Although AE and LPC had acceptable sensitivity and positive predictivity, the HMM performed even better than both of these in terms of overall error rate. It would seem that an observational model such as the HMM, fits the data better than parametric models such as AE and LPC. Finally, as the computing power of medical systems increases, more sophisticated algorithms may be exploited in ways that leads to more accurate computerized ECG interpretation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/788166/,Neural Networks for Signal Processing IX: Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop (Cat.

The automatic diagnosis of breast cancer is an important, real-world medical problem. It is occasionally difficult to attain the ultimate diagnosis even for medical experts due to the complexity and non-linearity of the relationships between the large measured factors. It is possibly resolved with a human like decision-making process using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. ANFIS is an AI algorithm which has the advantages of both fuzzy inference system and neural networks. Therefore, it can deal with ambiguous data and learn from the past data by itself. Considering these features, applying ANFIS as a diagnostic system was considered in our experiment. In addition, in real implementations, the performance of diagnosis system in computation is an important issue as well as the correctness of the output from the inference system.

Human gesture used for Man-Machine Interaction became attractive as it offers a simpler way of controlling sophisticated devices, in a sci-fi-like scenario, in return of an increasingly computational power required by the artificial intelligence algorithms needed to detect, track and recognize them. There have been attempts to bring a solution to it by using 2D or 3D based image processing methods. There is a clear balance incline towards 3D methods in the consumer product as besides the almost insurmountable difficulties for producing robust and stable results, the price constraint added supplementary hurdles. As perfect illumination conditions are core factors in obtaining the above results, the infrared light was unanimously adopted by the domain technologies. In this paper, a novel real-time depth-mapping principle and a corresponding hardware solution for an IR depth-mapping camera is introduced. The new IR camera architecture comprises an illuminator module which is pulsed and modulated via a monotonic function using a phase-locked loop control for the laser intensity, while the reflected infrared light is captured during the increasing and decreasing monotonic function. A reconfigurable hardware architecture (RHA) unit calculates the depth and controls the IR waves in synchronism with the infrared sensor. The resolution of the depth map is variable depending on the resolution and gating possibilities of the image sensor. A sensor of 1 megapixel is used, providing a resolution of 1024×1024. Images of real objects are reconstructed in 3D based on the data obtained by the laser controlled by the RHA. A corresponding image processing algorithm builds the 3D map of the object in real-time.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors.

10.1109/BIOSMART.2019.8734185,An IoT-Cloud Based Solution for Real-Time and Batch Processing of Big Data: Application in Healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"With the large use of Internet of Things (IoT) today, everything around us seems to generate data. The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain. We implement the proposed solution on Amazon Cloud operator known as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and use a Raspberry pi as an IoT device to generate data in real time. We test the solution with the specific application of ECG monitoring and abnormality reporting.

10.1109/ICMA.2016.7558929,An artificial neural network based haptic rendering of contact with deformable bodies,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents an artificial neural network based 3-DOF haptic rendering scheme to render the contact force between a rigid object and a deformable body in a virtual environment. The finite-element method (FEM) technique is widely used for solving the deformation problem. However, this method has a heavy computational load to get accurate result, so it is difficult to apply this method to haptic simulating. To solve the challenging problem, in this paper, we presented a new motion control scheme to divide the motion of a rigid virtual object into three sub-movements along the three axes of a Cartesian-coordinate, based on which three single-input and single-output neural networks can be separately used to compute the three feedback force components along all the coordinate axes. The vector composition of the three force components is the feedback force exerted to a user through a haptic device. The proposed method can ensure the high accuracy and the high update rate of 3-DOF haptic rendering of deformable bodies. To testify the accuracy of the artificial neural network for haptic rendering, a medical robot is used to measure the data of the neural network training in the physical world, and a haptic device based experiment with a virtual environment validates the proposed algorithm for 3-DOF haptic rendering.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7558929/,2016 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation,7-10 Aug. 2016,ieeexplore

The distribution of samples in a training set can be extremely biased. Standard GPP assigns equal weights to all samples. It slows down evolution because crowded regions of samples dominate the fitness evaluation causing premature convergence.

By making use of sensors in smart wearable devices, the patient-generated data can be sent to electronic devices or any health records. This enables doctors/caregivers to directly monitor the patient activity in real-time. Moreover, a high volume of medical information is continuously produced with every passing day. It is an intrinsic need to gather, store and learn from the medical data to predict health of such patients. An alarming increase in the number of diabetic patients has become an important area of concern for medical researchers. In this paper, a Cloud IoT based framework for diabetes prediction is proposed and presented. It incorporates sensors in smart wearable devices as set of connected IoT devices for continuous monitoring and collections of blood glucose data which is sent for storage in cloud environment where an ensemble model is used to predict diabetes in patients.

Several studies have been carried out in data mining field to improve the capability of data analysis on huge datasets. Cancer is one of the most fatal diseases in the world. Lung Cancer with high rate of accurance is one of the serious problems and biggest killing disease in India. Prediction of occurance of the lung cancer is very difficult because it depends upon multiple attributes which could not be analyzedeasily. In this paper a real time lung cancer dataset is taken from SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences) Lucknow. A realtime dataset is always associated with its obvious challenges such as missing values, highly dimensional, noise, and outlier, which is not suitable for efficient classification. A clustering approach is an alternative solution to analyze the data in an unsupervised manner. In this current research work main focus is to develop a novel approach to create accurate clusters of desired real time datasets called Foggy K-means clustering.

Early detection and removal of colon polyps via colonoscopy have proved to be an effective approach to prevent colorectal cancer. Recently, various CNN-based computer-aided systems have been developed to help physicians detect polyps. However, these systems do not perform well in real-world colonoscopy operations due to the significant difference between images in a real colonoscopy and those in the public datasets. Unlike the well-chosen clear images with obvious polyps in the public datasets, images from a colonoscopy are often blurry and contain various artifacts such as fluid, debris, bubbles, reflection, specularity, contrast, saturation, and medical instruments, with a wide variety of polyps of different sizes, shapes, and textures. All these factors pose a significant challenge to effective polyp detection in a colonoscopy. To this end, we collect a private dataset that contains 7,313 images from 224 complete colonoscopy procedures. This dataset represents realistic operation scenarios and thus can be used to better train the models and evaluate a system's performance in practice. We propose an integrated system architecture to address the unique challenges for polyp detection.

10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320014,CrossMine: efficient classification across multiple database relations,IEEE,Conferences,"Most of today's structured data is stored in relational databases. Such a database consists of multiple relations which are linked together conceptually via entity-relationship links in the design of relational database schemas. Multirelational classification can be widely used in many disciplines, such as financial decision-making, medical research, and geographical applications. However, most classification approaches only work on single ""flat"" data relations. It is usually difficult to convert multiple relations into a single flat relation without either introducing huge, undesirable ""universal relation"" or losing essential information. Previous works using inductive logic programming approaches (recently also known as relational mining) have proven effective with high accuracy in multi-relational classification. Unfortunately, they suffer from poor scalability w.r.t. the number of relations and the number of attributes in databases. We propose CrossMine, an efficient and scalable approach for multirelational classification. Several novel methods are developed in CrossMine, including (1) tuple ID propagation, which performs semantics-preserving virtual join to achieve high efficiency on databases with complex schemas, and (2) a selective sampling method, which makes it highly scalable w.r.t. the number of tuples in the databases. Both theoretical backgrounds and implementation techniques of CrossMine are introduced.

10.1109/ICMLA51294.2020.00141,DEAL: Deep Evidential Active Learning for Image Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be state-of-the-art models for image classification. However, large labeled data sets are generally needed for the training and validation of such models. In many domains, unlabeled data is available but labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required. Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled data. Through selecting the most informative and representative data instances for labeling, AL can contribute to more efficient learning of a model. Recent AL methods for CNNs propose different solutions for the selection of such instances. However, they do not perform consistently well and are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel AL algorithm that efficiently learns from unlabeled data by capturing high prediction uncertainty. By replacing the softmax standard output of a CNN with the parameters of a Dirichlet density, the model learns to identify data instances that contribute efficiently to improving model performance during training. We demonstrate in several experiments with publicly available data that our method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art AL approaches. It can be easily implemented and does not require extensive computational resources for training. Additionally, we are able to show the benefits of the approach on the real-world medical use case of pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images.

In recent years, with the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), many researchers have focused on diagnose diseases by mining EMRs. They apply machine learning algorithms to train EMRs, and modify models to improve the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. However, these studies input the patient characteristics into the model at once, without multiple online interactions. Or, put another way, although those methods have performed well in the laboratory, they are not suitable for a real consultation environment. In the real world, doctors often guide patients to describe the condition step by step, and then combine the checkup value to diagnose the disease. In this paper, we simulate this process and propose a novel system called DKDR, which combine a knowledge graph and deep reinforcement learning to diagnose disease. The medical knowledge graph is built by crawling 100K web pages, which help users improve the description of disease characteristics. We use q-learning to find the combination of symptoms in the best diagnosis and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train each strategy. Finally, we experiment on real medical datasets and synthetic medical datasets. DKDR finds the best combination of symptoms for diagnosing disease.

However, GANs suffer from the problem of mode collapse in the training process then generate images with a limited variety. On the other hand, variational auto-encoder (VAE) is free from mode collapse but it generates blurred images. In this work, we study an auto-encoding generative adversarial network combining the advantages of GAN and VAE to generate realistic images for medical thyroid ultrasound image augmentation.

In this work we address this issue for skin-lesion classification models, with two objectives: finding out what are the spurious correlations exploited by biased networks, and debiasing the models by removing such spurious correlations from them. We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias.

This detector should be reliable in real-world settings using easily accessible, non-invasive data sources. We present a simple yet robust paradigm for decoding pain using neural and physiological data including electroencephalography (EEG), pulse, and skin conductance (GSR) measurements. The present study uses multivariate classification to distinguish painful events from non-painful multimodal sensory stimuli. To classify the pain response and detect relevant data attributes, we employed a sparse logistic regression (SLR) machine learning protocol with automatic feature selection. EEG input consisted of time-frequency changes under trial conditions, and physiological data included fluctuations and spikes in pulse and skin conductance. Classification averaged 70% accuracy and selected between 5 and 15 features. In our experiment, pain was induced by cold stimulation which became noxious with prolonged exposure. Due to the long, ramp-and-hold nature of the stimulus, along with individual variability in sensitivity to pain, we did not observe specific rapid evoked responses or time-locked events common across participants. However, this format more closely resembles the experience of pain conditions requiring intervention which could be facilitated by a decoding system. The results illustrate the feasibility of developing a wireless pain detection system and give insight to important temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG events and physiological indicators of pain states. Success of the classifier protocol using these parameters could lead to the creation of a closed-loop system for decoding and intervention which can be applied in engineering and medical contexts.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8008404/,2017 8th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER),25-28 May 2017,ieeexplore

Due to the low-contrast characteristic and noisy nature of ultrasound images, it might require expertise for non-expert users to recognize tongue gestures in applications such as visual training of a second language. Moreover, quantitative analysis of tongue motion needs the tongue dorsum contour to be extracted, tracked, and visualized. Manual tongue contour extraction is a cumbersome, subjective, and error-prone task. Furthermore, it is not a feasible solution for real-time applications. The growth of deep learning has been vigorously exploited in various computer vision tasks, including ultrasound tongue contour tracking. In the current methods, the process of tongue contour extraction comprises two steps of image segmentation and post-processing. This paper presents a new novel approach of automatic and real-time tongue contour tracking using deep neural networks. In the proposed method, instead of the two-step procedure, landmarks of the tongue surface are tracked.

Although significant progress has been made in emotion recognition for music, image and video stimuli, it remains largely unexplored for immersive virtual stimuli. Our main objective for this line of investigation is to enable consistently reliable emotion recognition for virtual reality stimuli using only cheap, commercial-off-the-shelf electroencephalography (EEG) headsets which have significantly less recording channels and far lower signal resolution commonly called “Wearable EEG” as opposed to medical-grade EEG headsets with the ultimate goal of applying EEG-based emotion prediction to procedurally-generated affective content such as immersive computer games and virtual learning environments through machine learning. Our prior preliminary study has found that the use of a 4-channel, 256-Hz was indeed able to perform the required emotion recognition tasks from VR stimuli albeit at classification rates of between 65-89% classification accuracy only using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers. For this particular study, we attempt to improve the classification rates to above 95% by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the use of various deep neural-based learning architectures for this domain. By tuning the deep neural classifiers in terms of the number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes and the nodal dropout ratio, the emotion prediction accuracy was able to be improved to over 96%.

Deep learning is a machine learning (ML) technique which learns features and tasks directly from data, trying to model human abstract thinking. Since deep learning can create features without a human intervention, it allows data scientists to use more complex sets of features in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches. In addition to this, the robustness to natural variations in the data is automatically learned and the deep learning architecture is flexible, so that the same neural network based approach can be applied to many different applications and data types. Our goal is to apply DL based techniques in the context of medical imaging with the purpose of developing a workflow for diagnosing cardiovascular pathologies or cerebral aneurysms. Since a major challenge of this approach is the lack of large training databases, in this paper we are focusing on performing data augmentation by generating realistic synthetic anatomical models of blood vessels. For this task we used geometries describing vessel-like structures and also real anatomies extracted from patients. We chose to experiment with two state of the art models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We address the problem of employing neural network based models on three dimensional surfaces. Such surfaces typically have an unstructured representation consisting of points and polygons and are not compatible with typical neural network architectures. We propose a technique based on surface voxelization which consists on representing the unstructured surface mesh as a three-dimensional image, therefore becoming inherently compatible with a standard convolutional neural network.

Unlike the existing methods for heartbeat classification, in which handcrafted ECG features are utilised, the proposed design leverages DNN for the classification of arrhythmia using a complete ECG beat. This obviates the need to extract ECG features separately and, produces an accurate and power optimised design for arrhythmia classification. Evaluation of the proposed methodology on the MIT-BIH dataset exhibits the accuracy and specificity of 97.01 % and 99.09%, respectively, which is comparable or better with respect to other algorithms implemented on software or ASIC based platforms.

10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

10.1109/NSS/MIC42677.2020.9508035,Estimating Ensemble Bias using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are powerful tools in many medical imaging applications including denoising. However, a major concern in deploying a CNN in safety-critical areas is to access its prediction accuracy on out-of-distribution test samples. Our previous study showed that while a CNN could generate similar ensemble standard deviation levels on inputs with different noise levels, the magnitude and location of bias could be substantially different. These observations imply that although CNNs can generate visually high-quality images from each individual dataset, the bias might be higher in one image than the other, which might lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is crucial for us to understand when and where a CNN is uncertain about its prediction in real clinical datasets. In this study, we investigate the use of a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) to estimate an uncertainty map of its prediction, and assess its correlations with the ensemble bias of its own and a conventional CNN's prediction ensemble bias, respectively. The BCNN is implemented by adding Monte Carlo dropout layers after each convolution and ReLU layer, which is equivalent to imposing a Bernoulli prior distribution on the network weights. At the testing stage, we acquire multiple stochastic forward passes through the network to generate the uncertainty map. We applied BCNN and CNN on two 18F-FDG scans, with one whole-body scan which is considered as an in-distribution test sample, and one brain only study which is considered as an out-of-distribution sample. For the whole-body scan, we generated 10 noise realizations for ensemble analysis using bootstrap. Our results demonstrate that BCNN can generate a prediction uncertainty map that highly correlates with the ensemble bias map. This technique could provide important guidance on interpreting the denoising results from a neural network where ground truth is unknown.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9508035/,2020 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC),31 Oct.-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

ECG that contains tremendous cardiac rhythm information plays an important role in clinical treatment. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can effectively build the relationship between ECG and the underlying arrhythmia in it. Due to the privacy sensitivity of the ECG, we introduced a federated learning (FL)-based distributed algorithm that enables each medical institution to cooperatively train a arrhythmia detection algorithm locally. Compared with the traditional centralized ML algorithms, the use of FL-based algorithm does not need to collect all the local ECG of each medical institution to an external platform to perform centralized learning, and hence preventing the privacy from leakage. However, ECG collected from different medical institution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) in reality, which will lead to non convergence of the FL-based algorithm. To address this challenge, we optimize the FL-based algorithm using a sharing strategy for partial ECG data of each medical institution combined with elastic weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm. Here, the sharing strategy, which makes each medical institution share ECG data to the central server while not share to other clients, could help build an initial FL model and EWC algorithm make the accuracy of the model trained by each medical institution not decline, therefore the proposed FL algorithm can achieve a trade-off between the privacy and model performance. The experiment results show that, compared with baseline FedAvg algorithm and FedCurv algorithm, the optimized FL-based algorithm is faster in convergence for IID ECG and achieves signicant improvement in terms of both recall and precision for non-IID ECG.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9344971/,2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),11-14 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Oftentimes different types of sensors are deployed in the hope of capturing precursor patterns that are highly correlated to a particular clinical episode, such as seizure, congestive heart failure etc. While there have been several studies that successfully identify patterns as reliable precursors for specific medical conditions, most of them require domain-specific knowledge and expertise. The developed algorithms are also unlikely to be applicable to other medical conditions. In this paper we present a generalized algorithm that discovers potential precursor patterns without prior knowledge or domain expertise. The algorithm makes use of wavelet transform and information theory to extract generic features, and it is also classifier agnostic. Based on experiment results using three distinct datasets collected from real-world patients, our algorithm has attained performance comparable to those obtained from previous studies that rely heavily on domain-expert knowledge. Furthermore, the algorithm also discovers non-trivial knowledge in the process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6346398/,2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,28 Aug.-1 Sept. 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/CNS48642.2020.9162311,HEKA: A Novel Intrusion Detection System for Attacks to Personal Medical Devices,IEEE,Conferences,"Modern Smart Health Systems (SHS) involve the concept of connected personal medical devices. These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks. Our extensive evaluation shows that HEKA can effectively detect different attacks on personal medical devices with an accuracy of 98.4% and Fl-score of 98%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162311/,2020 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),29 June-1 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531143,Health Risk Prediction Using Big Medical Data - a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"The massive amount of medical data accumulated from patients and healthcare providers has become a vast reservoir of knowledge source that may enable promising applications such as risk predictive modeling, clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance. However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160454/,"2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",25-29 May 2015,ieeexplore

Over the last decade, the increasing world-wide demand for early detection of breast cancer has resulted in necessity of new research avenues. The current work on the early detection of breast cancer, which mainly focus on the respective (independent) analysis of clinical document and medical images, ignoring the internal relevance internal interactions (relations) of images and reports, and has been proved to be somewhat effective in the experiment but not practical in the real world. In this paper, we propose fusion convolutional neural networks (f-CNNs) to extract and mine the semantic interactions of radiology images and reports. Our f-CNNs provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, text composition, and the matching relations between the two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN modeling the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from words based on character-level representation and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the relations between image and sentence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed f-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for image and sentence matching.

10.23919/FRUCT.2019.8711974,Impact of Adversarial Examples on the Efficiency of Interpretation and Use of Information from High-Tech Medical Images,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper we discuss the possibility of adversarial examples appearance in high-tech medical images (Computer tomography and Magnetic resonance imaging), due to the noise inherent in the technology of their formation, and therefore we suggest ways to counteract this effect. As the idea of the paper we put two questions: 1. Can individual instances of real high-tech medical images work as AE when being analyzed with the use of neural networks? 2. Is it possible to defend oneself against such ""natural"" adversarial attacks with the simplest possible means? In our research, we tried the following defence methods: adversarial training, Gaussian data augmentation and bounded RELU (see section 3 for a detailed description). We conducted the experiment with the use of the neural network - a variant of convolutional network structure combining U-Net with the region proposal networks. As the source data two datasets were chosen - the Lung Image Database Consortium image collection containing 1018 lung cancer screening thoracic CT scans and Brain MRI DataSet containing clinical imaging data of glioma patients (a total of 274 cases). The experiments showed that the degree of manifestation of AE varies depending on the type of training model. When training a model not using techniques of defences on adversarial examples, the number of incorrectly recognized images is quite large (200 per 10,000 for CT and 285 per 10,000 for MRI). By proper selecting of the activation function of CNN, it can be reduced to 60 and 68, respectively. With augmentation of training dataset by Gaussian noised images, this number drops to 21 and 26. An even greater reduction in the number of incorrectly recognized images is achieved using the Adversarial Training method -12 and 15. Thus, it is shown that the adversarial effect is possible after the application of adversarial training techniques, but the degree of noise in such an image will be much higher than before using these techniques, and it will be easy enough for the doctor to recognize them visually and exclude them from further consideration.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8711974/,2019 24th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT),8-12 April 2019,ieeexplore

We propose a weakly-supervised, label-driven formulation for learning 3D voxel correspondence from higher-level label correspondence, thereby bypassing classical intensity-based image similarity measures. During training, a convolutional neural network is optimised by outputting a dense displacement field (DDF) that warps a set of available anatomical labels from the moving image to match their corresponding counterparts in the fixed image. These label pairs, including solid organs, ducts, vessels, point landmarks and other ad hoc structures, are only required at training time and can be spatially aligned by minimising a cross-entropy function of the warped moving label and the fixed label. During inference, the trained network takes a new image pair to predict an optimal DDF, resulting in a fully-automatic, label-free, real-time and deformable registration. For interventional applications where large global transformation prevails, we also propose a neural network architecture to jointly optimise the global- and local displacements.

Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

An efficient way of dealing with these data is by storing them in list-mode (LM). To reconstruct the data, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) is efficiently applied to the list-mode data, resulting in the list-mode maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (LMMLEM) reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we consider a PET system consisting of two thick detectors facing each other. PMT outputs are collected for each coincidence event and are used to perform 3D maximum-likelihood (ML) position estimation of location of interaction. The mathematical properties of the ML estimation allow accurate modeling of the detector blur and provide a theoretical framework for the subsequent estimation step, namely the LMM-LEM reconstruction. Indeed, a rigorous statistical model for the detector output can be obtained from calibration data and used in the calculation of the conditional probability density functions for the interaction location estimates. Our implementation of the 3D ML position estimation takes advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware and permits accurate real-time estimates of position of interaction.

Developments in machine learning are happening every day at an exponential rate. However, there are still some fields that are comparatively untouched by its impact. Areas like the medical and sports sector that could benefit immensely by utilizing the advancements in Machine Learning and still are lagging solely because of one crucial reason: unavailability of data. The unavailability of data results in scarcity of data used for training the machine learning models, which directly affects the accuracy of the models, making them less reliable for real-time usage. To counter this roadblock, this paper is proposing a solution to generating synthetic data in this paper. As the name suggests, a synthetic dataset is a repository of data that is generated programmatically. So, it is not collected by any real-life survey or experiment. It's the primary purpose; therefore, it is to be flexible and rich enough to help a Machine Learning practitioner conduct fascinating experiments with various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images. Through a minimax two-player game, the generative and discriminative networks can train each other. The generated synthetic images are used to train a CNN classification model for tissue recognition.

These techniques are mostly implemented at the application layer and make simplistic assumptions about the system resources communication and they are often unconvinced to the co-design in embedded system SoC and MPSoC. Moreover, they often assume that the data codec video characteristics and their processing needs are stationary, which is not true in practice especially in hardware for the real target FPGA. In fact, data streams in codec video are highly dynamic and may also experience concept drift, thereby requiring continuous online adaptation of the throughput and quality to each processing task in video and frame. Hence, existing solutions for multimedia and telecommunication applications are often too conservative or too aggressive, especially in video codec. To address these limitations, complexity in video test, quality of frame, precision, send video with a fast time especially in medical applications, airport and military flight problems. we propose offline algorithm scheduling which minimize the execution time (i.e., troughput and output quality of video and frame) of medical and military applications under real time and resources constraints.

Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) presents a dynamic way for users to interact with computers and digital information. However, the topic of mobile augmented reality for media learning anatomy is still lacking because the current study still focuses on developing and using it as a learning tool. So, there is a need to observe impressions of user experience using MAR. This study aims to observe the impression user experience to augmented reality-based learning media designed to support learning cranium anatomy. This study uses the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to observe user experience. The experiment process includes 33 international program medical students first year at Gadjah Mada University.

Pathological diagnoses are sensitive to many external factors and is known to be subjective. Only systems that can meet strict requirements in pathology would be able to run along pathological routines and eventually digitized the area, and the developed platform should comply with existing pathological routines and international standards. Currently, there are a number of available software tools which can perform histopathological tasks including virtual slide viewing, annotating, and basic image analysis, however, none of them can serve as a digital platform for pathology. Here we describe OpenHI2, an enhanced version Open Histopathological Image platform which is capable of supporting all basic pathological tasks and file formats; ready to be deployed in medical institutions on a standard server environment or cloud computing infrastructure. In this paper, we also describe the development decisions for the platform and propose solutions to overcome technical challenges including responsive region retrieval and viewing, virtual slide magnification, recording of diagnostic areas. These factors would promote OpenHI2 be used as a platform for histopathological images in real-world clinical settings. Furthermore, in research, OpenHI2 inherited the annotation functionality from the previous version, thus acquired annotations can be directly utilized by the newly added machine learning module which include popular machine learning models to perform tasks such as histology image classification and segmentation in the same environment.

10.1109/ICIECA.2005.1644370,Optimal approach for enhancement of large and small scale near-infrared and infrared imaging,IEEE,Conferences,"In a broad area of industry such as remote sensing and medical diagnosing, imaging enhancement technology takes a leading role, where energy distribution of the light source depends not only on image coordinate but also on wavelength. Both infrared (IR) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging techniques have a variety of applications in these fields. For instance, satellite images are taken via IR or NIR spectrometer and laser Doppler medical scanning is collaborated with NIR spectrometer. Matrix functions of any image correspond to brightness or energy at each image pixel. The actual decision making must rely on detailed investigation of images being obtained. Therefore, image processing should be taken into account so as to enhance the results from real world. Segmentation is an image analysis approach to clarify feature ambiguity and information noise, which divides an image into separate parts that correlate with the objects or areas of the particular object involved. This procedure can be conducted by clustering, which is a process of partitioning a set of pattern vectors into subsets. Being a simple unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm has the potential to both simplify the computation and accelerate the convergence. In most cases optimization is closely related to clustering, which gives rise to the best way of problem solving. In this article, optimal approach is proposed to be implemented along with image segmentation. This methodology is to enhance both large scale and small scale IR and NIR image processing",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1644370/,2005 International Conference on Industrial Electronics and Control Applications,29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,ieeexplore

In other words, models can classify unknown samples as known classes with high confidence, which could lead to catastrophic mistakes.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

The method is validated by the proposed planar 3D res-u-net network with encoder transferred from the 2D VGG-16, which is applied for a single-stage unbalanced 3D image data segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the method on the MICCAI 2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset utilizing solely fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence without brain extraction for training and inference to simulate real medical praxis. The planar 3D res-u-net network performed the best both in sensitivity and Dice score amongst end to end methods processing raw MRI scans and achieved comparable Dice score to a state-of-the-art unimodal not end to end approach. Complete source code was released under the open-source license, and this paper complies with the Machine learning reproducibility checklist. By implementing practical transfer learning for 3D data representation, we could segment heavily unbalanced data without selective sampling and achieved more reliable results using less training data in a single modality. From a medical perspective, the unimodal approach gives an advantage in real praxis as it does not require co-registration nor additional scanning time during an examination. Although modern medical imaging methods capture high-resolution 3D anatomy scans suitable for computer-aided detection system processing, deployment of automatic systems for interpretation of radiology imaging is still rather theoretical in many medical areas.

10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929317,Practical Significance of GA PartCC in Multi-Label Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Multi-label classification (MLC) can be defined as the objective of learning a classification model which has the capability to infer the accurate labels of new, previously unseen, objects where it is a likely situation that each object of the dataset may rightfully belong to multiple class labels. While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details. Through the research conducted for the purpose of this study, both challenges are tackled along with others detailed further on simultaneously using Genetic Algorithms (GA) over a Partial CC (PartCC) model, which is a modification over CC.

10.1109/InnoTek.2014.6877371,Preventing recreational boating fatalities and serious injuries with: The ANN (Assistant Naval Navigator) System Enterprise,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the significant increase in motor vehicle fatalities due to texting while driving, several US States are implementing or drafting laws that will outright ban the use of handheld devices (“I” and cell Phones, pads, business communicators, etc.) while operating a motor vehicle. At the same time, US recreational boaters already are burdened with high numbers of fatal and injurious accidents, and are being encouraged to navigate using Internet-based APPs that require texting. Our analyses of trends in recent US Coast Guard's (USCG's) Boating Statistics<sup>1</sup> seem to support that accidents due to inattention are on the rise. Specifically, owner/operator inattention is causing a higher number of collisions with other recreational boats and these are accompanied by a related rise in fatalities per collision. This observation is in-line with the US Dept. of Transportation findings that texting while driving leads to more violent accidents; therefore, more fatalities/accident. Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction. Also alarming, in 13% of the 4515 accidents the cause was owner/operator inattention. Add to this, in 1010 accidents of the 4,515, these involved a collision with another recreational boat! (That's over 22% of the total accidents). It's shocking to realize that the number of moms, dads, young men and women and children that are dying and seriously injured per year, while enjoying this recreational activity, was nearly equaled the yearly US troop losses and serious injuries during the Iraq war. Over 10 years ago we began our design effort by assembling a team of experts having experience with on-water Emergency Response, and marine-related technologies. By then, the author and his direct associate had accumulated more than 70 years of successful installation and start-up of computer-based control systems for very large and small processes. The applications included major metals, chemical, plastics, ore-processing, underground coal mining industries, as well as, a medical enterprise application. We envisioned how the vessel navigation process may be adapted to feedforward/feedback control system architecture in real time. Proceeding on this basis, our team met frequently with system integrators, boat and engine manufacturers, Boat Owners Association of the US (BoatUS) Execs, towing station owner/operators and US Coast Guard Certified “A” Captains and pilots. In these meetings, our goal continued to focus on a plan for applying advanced control theory to enhance marine vessel navigation. This plan is now in readiness for productization - a viable, developed and US Patented <sup>2</sup> system with primary missions of life-saving and/serious injury prevention. Think of it!

10.1109/IC2E48712.2020.00017,Realising Edge Analytics for Early Prediction of Readmission: A Case Study,IEEE,Conferences,"The post-discharge support is increasingly suggested for stroke patients to be discharged earlier and start rehabilitation at home. Considering that stroke patients usually have a high chance of recurrence, a good prognostic program is essential to improve diagnostic capabilities while reducing readmission rate to further save medical sources. In this context, various machine learning methods have been leveraged to obtain diagnostic findings and guide further treatments. However, those approaches mainly focus on performing analysis using a single data source obtained from the hospital, which could ignore the information complementarity between different groups of features and several subtle and discrete differences of physical interpretation among them. In this paper, we propose an Edge-based system design for post-stroke surveillance and warning prediction, called PSMART (Post-Stroke Mobile Auxiliary Rudiment Treatment), for processing enriched pathogenic factors of ischemic stroke from multi-sensors (views) to make readmission warning predictions. Our approach can considerably enrich the distinctive features from raw data, as well as exploit the consistency and complementary proprieties of different views, leading to better learning results. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset, and the accuracy can reach up to 98.98%. Moreover, experiment results also show that our proposed approach can provide better accuracy when compared to the single-view ones.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096429/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E),21-24 April 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351695,Recovering size and shape of polyp from endoscope image by RBF-NN modification,IEEE,Conferences,"Previous approaches have proposed to recover the poly shape but it is desired that absolute size of polyp can be obtained as a medical endoscope system. The VBW (Vogel-Breuss-Weickert) model is proposed as a method to recover 3-D shape under point light source illumination and perspective projection. However, the VBW model recovers relative, not absolute, shape. Here, shape modification is introduced to recover the exact shape. Modification is applied to the output of the VBW model. First, a local brightest point is used to estimate the reflectance parameter from two images obtained with movement of the endoscope camera in depth. After the reflectance parameter is estimated, a sphere image is generated and used for Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) learning. The NN implements the shape modification. NN input is the gradient parameters produced by the VBW model for the generated sphere. NN output is the true gradient parameters for the true values of the generated sphere. Depth can then be recovered using the modified gradient parameters. It was confirmed that NN gives better performance than the linear regression via computer simulation and real experiment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7351695/,2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP),27-30 Sept. 2015,ieeexplore

Images were firstly annotated with text and then searched usinga text-based approach from traditional database management systems which is time consuming and difficult to manage. To overcome this problem, CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) is introduced which is becoming the hottest research area these days due to vast range of real time applications suchas Crime Prevention, Photograph Archives, Medical Diagnosis, Geographical Information and Remote Sensing System etc. The CBIR system consist of various phases to extract and matchthe features and search the images from the large scale image databases on the basis of visual contents such as Color, Shape andTexture according to the user's interest. As Semantic Gap is themost important and challenging issue. In this paper, Relevance Feedback is used to deal with this issue which based on Support Vector machine has been extensively used in the CBIR system to bridge the semantic gap between low level features and high level human perception features.

The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition. By using a self-care management system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. This paper describes the state of the art in pervasive healthcare applications and the communication technologies that assist healthcare providers to offer better services for patients. This research proposes an alert system that could send immediate information to the medical consultants once detects serious condition from the collected data of the patient. Furthermore, the system is able to track various types of symptoms through mobile application in the purpose of obtaining support from medical specialists when it is required. A machine-learning algorithm was conducted to perform the classification process. Four experiments were carried out to classify sickle cell disease patients from normal patients using machine-learning algorithm in which 99.5984% classification accuracy was achieved using Multi-layer perceptron.

10.1109/CBMS.2007.94,Rotation Forest and Random Oracles: Two Classifier Ensemble Methods,IEEE,Conferences,"Classification methods are widely used in computer-based medical systems. Often, the accuracy of a classifier can be improved using a classifier ensemble, the combination of several classifiers. Two classifiers ensembles and their results on several medical data sets will be presented: Rotation Forest (Rodriguez, Kuncheva and Alonso) and Random Oracles (Kuncheva and Rodriguez). Rotation Forest is a method for generating classifier ensembles based on feature extraction. To create the training data for a base classifier, the feature set is randomly split into K subsets (K is a parameter of the algorithm) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to each subset. All principal components are retained in order to preserve the variability information in the data. Thus, K axis rotations take place to form the new features for a base classifier. The idea of the rotation approach is to encourage simultaneously individual accuracy and diversity within the ensemble. Diversity is promoted through the feature extraction for each base classifier. Decision trees were chosen here because they are sensitive to rotation of the feature axes, hence the name ""forest."" Accuracy is sought by keeping all principal components and also using the whole data set to train each base classifier. Comparisons with various standard ensemble methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forest) will be reported. Diversity-error diagrams reveal that Rotation Forest ensembles construct individual classifiers which are more accurate than these in AdaBoost and Random Forest and more diverse than these in Bagging, sometimes more accurate as well. A random oracle classifier is a mini-ensemble formed by a pair of classifiers and a fixed, randomly created oracle that selects between them. The random oracle can be thought of as a random discriminant function which splits the data into two subsets with no regard of any class labels or cluster structure. Two random oracles has been considered: linear and spherical. A random oracle classifier can be used as the base classifier of any ensemble method. It is argued that this approach encourages extra diversity in the ensemble while allowing for high accuracy of the individual ensemble members. Experiments with several data sets from UCI and 11 ensemble models will be reported. Each ensemble model will be examined with and without the oracle. The results will show that all ensemble methods benefited from the new approach, most markedly so random subspace and bagging. A further experiment with seven real medical data sets will demonstrate the validity of these findings outside the UCI data collection. When using Naive Bayes Classifiers as base classifiers, the experiments show that ensembles based solely upon the spherical oracle (and no other ensemble heuristic) outrank Bagging, Wagging, Random Subspaces, AdaBoost.Ml, MultiBoost and Decorate. Moreover, all these ensemble methods are better with any of the two random oracles than their standard versions without the oracles.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4262617/,Twentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07),20-22 June 2007,ieeexplore

Although this endeavor is well-established, existing solutions are typically restricted to lab or hospital conditions because they operate on recordings from a set of EEG electrodes that covers the whole head. By contrast, a true breakthrough for these applications would be the deployment `in the real world', by means of wearable devices that encompass just one (or a few) channels. Such a reduction of the available information inevitably makes the classification task more challenging. We tackle this issue by means of a multilinear subspace learning step (using data from multiple channels during training) and subsequently solving a regression problem with a low-rank structure to classify new trials (using data from only a single channel during testing).

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities.

These Trojans lead to un-desired change in functionality of the design and provide easy access to sensitive information. Trojans attacks or malicious activities are triggered based on very rare conditions, which can evade test-time Trojan detection but can arise during long hours of field operation.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models.

Data stream classification in a non-stationary environment is attaining more attention recently. It is a highly challenging task, since the concept drift and limited labeled data.

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore

Many neurological diseases like paralysis are caused by the interruption of spike propagation due to the malfunctioning neurons in the signaling pathway where the spikes are carried. In this paper, we propose a neuron specific statistical multiplexing scheme to substitute a faulty sensory neural pathway with a neighboring functional one. Since the spikes are stereotyped events and they have no addressing information, we developed an addressing scheme utilizing the spikes themselves. The performance achieved by the proposed technique is analyzed in terms of the percentage of the spikes transmitted under various scenarios. We also compared the results obtained with the previously proposed TDMA based multiplexing schemes. The proposed statistical multiplexing based technique has lower implementation complexity than the previously introduced TDMA based techniques.

In order to establish an enterprise hospital information system, the integration among these heterogeneous systems must be considered. Complete integration should cover three aspects: data integration, function integration and workflow integration. However most of the previous design of architecture did not accomplish such a complete integration. This article offers an architecture design of the enterprise hospital information system based on the concept of digital neural network system in hospital.

Unsurprisingly, the cybersecurity of MCPS is of high concern, as they are life-critical systems that, if compromised, may result in dire consequences to the patient. A variety of security requirements have been developed over the past 10 years as a result of governmental acts such as HITECH in order to better secure and protect healthcare environments. However, it is unclear how applicable these re-quirements may be to MCPS infrastructures. As a result, this case study analyzes current healthcare security requirements and their applicability to MCPS using an approach that leverages ontological representations and automated requirement traversal techniques. Using such a methodology, we find that 70% of applicable requirements/risks for MCPS components are missing from the security documentation, including serious items such as Authentication, Data Encryption, DoS attacks, and Legacy Vulnerabilities. We also validate our results within real-world instances and find that almost half of the relevant requirements are not implemented within existing MCPS architectures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8648683/,"2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)",26-28 Sept. 2018,ieeexplore

So far, high compression rate algorithms require part of the training dataset for a low precision calibration, or a fine-tuning process. However, this requirement is unacceptable when the data is unavailable or contains sensitive information, as in medical and biometric use-cases. Contributions: We present three methods for generating synthetic samples from trained models. Then, we demonstrate how these samples can be used to calibrate and fine-tune quantized models without using any real data in the process. Our best performing method has a negligible accuracy degradation compared to the original training set. This method, which leverages intrinsic batch normalization layers' statistics of the trained model, can be used to evaluate data similarity. Our approach opens a path towards genuine data-free model compression, alleviating the need for training data during model deployment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9156818/,2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR),13-19 June 2020,ieeexplore

This article analyze the power of AO as data mining tools applied on databases collected in several medical intervention domains, with the aim of verify their real effectiveness, compared with the regression models and the standard ANN models, in processing such kind of complex real-world data. These tools have been applied by the authors in independent applications on nineteen analyses carried out on thirteen databases collected in five main medical domains. The performance obtained by the ANNs coupled with AO shows a systematic significant increase in terms of the overall accuracy, compared with both the traditional statistic methods (linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and the Standard ANNs. The added value of AO over standard ANNs consisted in an average increase in overall accuracy of about 10% ( from 77.59% to 88.07% respectively), bringing to a 16 % difference versus classical statistics models. This increase in predictive capacity was obtained with an average 50% ""intelligent"" reduction of the input variables.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8091750,The feasibility of deep learning algorithms integration on a GPU-based ultrasound research scanner,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound medical diagnostics is a real-time modality based on a doctor's interpretation of images. So far, automated Computer-Aided Diagnostic tools were not widely applied to ultrasound imaging. The emerging methods in Artificial Intelligence, namely deep learning, gave rise to new applications in medical imaging modalities. The work's objective was to show the feasibility of implementing deep learning algorithms directly on a research scanner with GPU software beamforming. We have implemented and evaluated two deep neural network architectures as part of the signal processing pipeline on the ultrasound research platform USPlatform (us4us Ltd., Poland). The USPlatform is equipped with a GPU cluster, enabling full software-based channel data processing as well as the integration of open source Deep Learning frameworks. The first neural model (S-4-2) is a classical convolutional network for one-class classification of baby body parts. We propose a simple 6-layer network for this task. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 786 ultrasound images of a fetal training phantom. The second model (Gu-net) is a fully convolutional neural network for brachial plexus localisation. The model uses `U-net'-like architecture to compute the overall probability of target detection and the probability mask of possible target locations. The model was trained and evaluated on 5640 ultrasound B-mode frames. Both training and inference were performed on a multi-GPU (Nvidia Titan X) cluster integrated with the platform. As performance metrics we used: accuracy as a percentage of correct answers in classification, dice coefficient for object detection, and mean and std. dev. of a model's response time. The `S-4-2' model achieved 96% classification accuracy and a response time of 3 ms (334 predictions/s). This simple model makes accurate predictions in a short time. The `Gu-net' model achieved a 0.64 dice coefficient for object detection and a 76% target's presence classification accuracy with a response time of 15 ms (65 predictions/s). The brachial plexus detection task is more challenging and requires more effort to find the right solution. The results show that deep learning methods can be successfully applied to ultrasound image analysis and integrated on a single advanced research platform.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8091750/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

The World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2016, reported that 17.9 million deaths that occur worldwide per year are a result of heart disease. In the health care sector, enormous data are being generated on a daily basis, which contains different types of data, and acquiring knowledge from these data is essential. This knowledge can be acquired using various data mining techniques to mine knowledge by designing models from the medical records dataset. We implement a machine learning based system that can detect and predict heart diseases in patients using the medical records of patients. The proposed solution is based on existing techniques like Random Forest Bayesian Classification and Logistic Regression, which provides a decision support system for medical professionals to detect and predict heart diseases and heart attacks in humans or individuals using risk factors of heart disease. The dataset used in our model consists of 18 features (risk factors) and 1990 observations after performing preprocessing. It was then split into 80% train sets and 20% test sets. Using real medical records of patients, a series of experiments were conducted to examine the performance and accuracy of the proposed system. The system was implemented in RStudio platform which predicts the risk of heart disease in patients.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092364,Towards real-time implementation of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) — How to Identify optimum acoustic output for SHAPE?,IEEE,Conferences,"Pressure measurements within the chambers of the heart yield critical information for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients (~92 million Americans), but the procedure used to gain these pressures, cardiac catheterization, is invasive and expensive. Subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) may be able to estimate intra-cardiac pressures noninvasively, if the optimum incident acoustic output (IAO) for SHAPE can be established in real-time. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine in real-time the optimum IAO for SHAPE. We developed a customized interface on a SonixTablet scanner (BK Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) using C/C++ and Qt libraries (The Qt Company, Oslo, Norway). In vitro experiments were conducted using a closed-loop flow system. Activated Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, N. Billerica, MA, USA; 0.1 ml) was mixed with 750 ml isotonic diluent. A pressure catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was used to acquire ambient pressure values. A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (f<sub>transmit</sub>: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). At the optimum IAO level the correlation coefficient between SHAPE and the pressure catheter data ranged between -0.6 and -0.9; for the IAO immediately below and above the optimum IAO, ranges were -0.4 to -0.8, and -0.6 to -0.8, respectively. In conclusion, optimum IAO level determination for insonating microbubbles to be utilized for SHAPE has been demonstrated; this will assist in real-time clinical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8092364/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore

However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets.

Different intelligent application scenarios can benefit from these computer-based systems that predict the ages of people correctly. Automatic apparent age system is particularly useful in medical diagnosis, facial beauty product development, movie role casting, the effect of plastic surgery, and anti-aging treatment. Predicting the real and apparent age of people has been quite difficult for both machines and humans. More recently, Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods have been extensively used for these classification task. It has incomparable advantages in extracting discriminative image features from human faces. However, many of the existing CNN-based methods are designed to be deeper and larger with more complex layers that makes it challenging to deploy on mobile devices with resource-constrained features. Therefore, we design a lightweight CNN model of fewer layers to estimate the real and apparent age of individuals from unconstrained real-time face images that can be deployed on mobile devices. The experimental results, when analyzed for classification accuracy on FG-NET, MORPH-II and APPA-REAL, with large-scale face images containing both real and apparent age annotations, show that our model obtains a state-of-the-art performance in both real and apparent age classification when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Various studies have developed automatic critical fall detection systems for emergency alarms and medical services. Window sizes and segmentation approaches would affect the system performance in terms of power consumption, computational speed and reliability that are essential considerations in the real-world implementation. Intuitively, employing shorter window sizes and simpler segmentation approaches leads to a faster detection speed and better power efficiency. However, few works explore the effects of windowing methods on detection performance, especially for machine learning models. This paper investigates the impact of segmentation approaches and window sizes in wearable-based critical fall detection systems with machine learning models. Two generally used segmentation approaches, including sliding windows and impact-defined windows, are explored with a range of window sizes from 0.5 s to 5.0 s and four machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Naïve Bayes (NB). The results show that sliding windows are more sensitive to the changes of window sizes compared to impact-defined windows. However, the differences between the best performance of both segmentation approaches are within 1% (99.66% in sliding windows and 99.78% in impact-defined windows).

Application of these methods to medical signals and images can help caregivers form proper decision-making. One of the important IoMT medical application areas includes aggressive driving behaviors to mitigate road incidents and crashes. Various IoMT-enabled body sensors or camera sensors can be utilized for real-time monitoring and detection of drivers' bio-signal status such as heart rate, blood pressure, and drivers' behaviors. However, it requires a lightweight detection module and a powerful training module with real-time storing and analysis of drivers' behaviors data from these medical devices to detect driving behaviors and provides instant feedback by the administrator for safety, gas emissions, and energy/fuel consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a bio-signal-based system for real-time detection of aggressive driving behaviors using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model with edge and cloud technologies. More precisely, the system consists of three modules, which are the driving behaviors detection module implemented on edge devices in the vehicle, the training module implemented in the cloud platform, and the analyzing module placed in the monitoring environment connected with a telecommunication network. The DCNN model of the proposed system is evaluated using a holdout test set of 30% on two different processed bio-signal datasets.

They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136648/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS.

Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow.

The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components. Eventually, various principal components are accumulated for clustering using scatter plots.

Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012900,BioCNN: A Hardware Inference Engine for EEG-Based Emotion Detection,IEEE,Journals,"EEG-based emotion classifiers have the potential of significantly improving the social integration of patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or the acute stages of Alzheimer's disease. Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc+, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. A subject-specific training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of 11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1.65 GOps that is in line with the real-time specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms, which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times. Its emotion inference accuracy is competitive with the top software-based emotion detectors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9151874/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

It can also be a solution for reducing the large number of sudden deaths outside of a hospital due to fatal diseases such as Arrhythmia. Towards this objective, we start from understanding the health situation, by diagnosing healthy and unhealthy persons. For this, we developed a decision-making system that is inspired by the medical doctors (MDs) decision-making processes. Our system is based on a CDS for cognitive decision-making and it can create a decision-making tree automatically. The simple, low complexity algorithmic design of the proposed system makes it suitable for real-time applications. A proof-of-concept case study of the implementation of the CDS was done on Arrhythmia disease. An accuracy of 95.4% was achieved using the proposed algorithms. Also, these algorithms can make a decision in less than 80 ms, and for one User, this includes the time for training. The proposed platform can be extended for more healthcare applications such as screening, disease class diagnosis, prevention, treatment, or monitoring healing.

However, the training activity can increase the stress level, especially in persons affected by a chronic stress condition. Wearable technologies and m-health solutions can support the person, the medical specialist, and long-term care facilities to efficiently implement personalised therapy solutions by monitoring the stress level of each subject during the motor and cognitive training. In this paper we present a comprehensive work on this topic, starting from a pilot study involving a group of frail older adults suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who actively participated in cognitive and motor rehabilitation sessions equipped with wearable physiological sensors and a mobile application for physiological monitoring. We analyse the collected data to investigate the stress response of frail older subjects during the therapy, and how the cognitive training is positively affected by physical exercise. Then, we evaluated a stress detection system based on several machine learning algorithms in order to highlight their performances on the real dataset we collected. However, stress detection algorithms generally provide only the identification of a stressful/non stressful event, which is not sufficient to personalise the therapy. Therefore, we propose a mobile system architecture for online stress monitoring able to infer the stress level during a session.

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection. We implemented our algorithms and evaluated the system with a large dataset of real-world subjects, including people with dementia, MCI persons, and cognitively healthy people. The results indicate the potential utility of this system to support the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006820/,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,1 July-Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000. Such initial extreme class imbalance during domain gamification poses a big challenge for the Watson machine-learning pipelines. The combination of ingested corpus sets, question-and-answer pairs, configuration settings, and NLP algorithms contribute toward the challenging data state. We propose several data engineering techniques, such as answer key vetting and expansion, source ingestion, oversampling classes, and question set modifications to increase the computed true labels. In addition, algorithm engineering, such as an implementation of the Newton-Raphson logistic regression with a regularization term, relaxes the constraints of class imbalance during training adaptation.

In this article, we propose a method based on machine learning (ML) and wearable sensors to identify the optimal exercises for the efficient detection of PD in patients. We first define 15 common tasks that are typically used to diagnose PD in modern clinical practice. However, these exercises still carry a high risk of misdiagnosis and, moreover, not all of them work well in the scope of existing ML solutions to support the diagnosis. Herein, we collect the data in a real clinical setting using a compact wearable wireless sensor node entailing a board gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer.

In this paper, we introduce the community anomaly detection system (CADS), an unsupervised learning framework to detect insider threats based on the access logs of collaborative environments. The framework is based on the observation that typical CIS users tend to form community structures based on the subjects accessed (e.g., patients' records viewed by healthcare providers). CADS consists of two components: 1) relational pattern extraction, which derives community structures and 2) anomaly prediction, which leverages a statistical model to determine when users have sufficiently deviated from communities. We further extend CADS into MetaCADS to account for the semantics of subjects (e.g., patients' diagnoses). To empirically evaluate the framework, we perform an assessment with three months of access logs from a real electronic health record (EHR) system in a large medical center. The results illustrate our models exhibit significant performance gains over state-of-the-art competitors.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy.

Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: (1) physiological feature extraction; (2) statistical-based feature selection; and (3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence. The new algorithm may serve as an effective method for future service robot real-time detection of patient emotional states and behavior adaptation to promote positive healthcare experiences.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6301777/,IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems,Jan. 2013,ieeexplore

X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results.

We introduce the unconditionally stable semiimplicit linearized difference scheme that is fashioned after additive operator split (AOS) [Weickert, J. et al. (1998)], [Goldenberg, R et al., (2001)] for Beltrami and the subjective surface computation. The Beltrami flow [Kimmel, R. (1997) (1999)], [Sochen, N. et al.

For gray-level images, we show that the flow equation can be arranged in an advection-diffusion form, revealing the edge-enhancing properties of this flow. This also suggests the application of AOS method for faster convergence. The subjective surface [Sarti, A. et al. (2002)] deals with constructing a perceptually meaningful interpretation from partial image data by mimicking the human visual system. However, initialization of the surface is critical for the final result and its main drawbacks are very slow convergence and the huge number of iterations required. We first show that the governing equation for the subjective surface flow can be rearranged in an AOS implementation, providing a near real-time solution to the shape completion problem in 2D and 3D. Then, we devise a new initialization paradigm where we first ""condition"" the viewpoint surface using the fast-marching algorithm.

These filters also reduce the information content of the image by suppressing spatial frequencies or by recognizing only a limited set of shapes. Here we show that denoising can be efficiently done using a nonlinear filter, which operates along patch neighborhoods and multiple copies of the original image. The use of patches enables the algorithm to account for spatial correlations in the random field whereas the multiple copies are used to recognize the noise statistics. The nonlinear filter, which is implemented by a hierarchical multistage system of multilayer perceptrons, outperforms state-of-the-art denoising algorithms such as those based on collaborative filtering and total variation. Compared to conventional denoising algorithms, our filter can restore images without blurring them, making it attractive for use in medical imaging where the preservation of anatomical details is critical.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7055927/,IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,Sept. 2015,ieeexplore

Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices.

Further, we can distinguish two types of IoMT devices: passive and active. Passive devices measure some parameters of the body and save them in databases.

However, the majority of these robots are overly complex, and require teleoperation via either a skilled operator or a specialised device, and often the operator must be present at the scene to navigate safely around the casualty. Instead, improving the autonomy of such robots can reduce the reliance on expert operators and potentially unstable communication systems, while still extracting the casualty in a safe manner. There are several stages in the casualty extraction procedure, from navigating to the location of the emergency, safely approaching and loading the casualty, to finally navigating back to the medical assistance location. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Decomposed-Objective based Model Predictive Control (HiDO-MPC) method for safely approaching and manoeuvring around the casualty. We implement this controller on ResQbot — a proof-of-concept mobile rescue robot we previously developed — capable of safely rescuing an injured person lying on the ground, i.e. performing the casualty extraction procedure. HiDO-MPC achieves the desired casualty extraction behaviour by decomposing the main objective into multiple sub-objectives with a hierarchical structure. At every time step, the controller evaluates this hierarchical decomposed objective and generates the optimal control decision. We have conducted a number of experiments both in simulation and using the real robot to evaluate the proposed method’s performance, and compare it with baseline approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy gives significantly better results than baseline approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and execution time, when applied to casualty extraction scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369351/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Although there are many frameworks focusing on training neural networks, there are few that focus on high performance inference and visualization of medical images. Neural network inference requires an inference engine (IE), and there are currently several IEs available including Intel's OpenVINO, NVIDIA's TensorRT, and Google's TensorFlow which supports multiple backends, including NVIDIA's cuDNN, AMD's ROCm and Intel's MKL-DNN. These IEs only work on specific processors and have completely different application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we presents methods for extending FAST, an open-source high performance framework for medical imaging, to use any IE with a common programming interface. Thereby making it easier for users to deploy and test their neural networks on different processors. This article provides an overview of current IEs and how they can be combined with existing software such as FAST. The methods are demonstrated and evaluated on three performance demanding medical use cases: real-time ultrasound image segmentation, computed tomography (CT) volume segmentation, and patch-wise classification of whole slide microscopy images. Runtime performance was measured on the three use cases with several different IEs and processors. This revealed that the choice of IE and processor can affect performance of medical neural network image analysis considerably. In the most extreme case of processing 171 ultrasound frames, the difference between the fastest and slowest configuration were half a second vs. 24 seconds. For volume processing, using the CPU or the GPU, showed a difference of 2 vs. 53 seconds, and for processing an whole slide microscopy image, the difference was 81 seconds vs. almost 16 minutes.

The technologies introduced in this paper are based on two key methods for real-time transformation of the photographic-quality Reinhard tone-mapping operator on emerging appliances, without compromising its quality. The first allows computing convolutions “selectively,” yielding faster computation than state-of-the-art convolution techniques while requiring a significantly lower memory footprint. The second utilizes machine learning to decrease the number of required convolutions per pixel. Both methods allow for scalable parallel implementation on commodity multicore processors and embedded processors. We also extend this implementation to 3-D and higher dimensions on massively parallel architectures for possible important applications such as medical imaging and multispectral or hyperspectral imaging applications. The inverse tone-mapping operation is equally important for rendering legacy content on new HDR displays. We used the underlying tone-mapping operator to perform inverse tone mapping using the two key methods described above. While existing techniques generally extend the dynamic range from the highlights side, our new operator performs two-sided expansion, yielding enhanced details in shades (and highlights) with generally negligible visible contrast loss.

In the field of rehabilitation, motion capture systems are often used to collect the motion information of the patient when he/she is performing rehabilitation tasks. It can be used to quantify the patient’s rehabilitation effectiveness and provide the physician with more objective data as a reference. Using inertial sensors is one of motion capture methods. However, the major challenge to reconstruct accurate human posture with sensor measurements are signal noise, bias and inaccurate gyroscope estimation during long-term wearing. Based on the reason mentioned above, this paper proposes a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based deep learning architecture that uses effective information collected by inertial sensors to predict a sequence of position of each joint of a human’s lower limbs in the 3D space throughout the entire motion. Such motion prediction result based on the deep learning model is to reduce the joint’s tracking error relying only on direct calculations based on measurements of inertial sensors.

Input data perseveration is a method to train more responsive RNN-based models. Input data is replicated k times during training and deployment. Each replication propagates through the cell state and output of the RNN, but only the output at the final replication is maintained and broadcast as the prediction for evaluation.

In digital pathology, domain shift can be manifested in differences between whole-slide images, introduced by for example differences in acquisition pipeline - between medical centers or over time. In order to harness the great potential presented by deep learning in histopathology, and ensure consistent model behavior, we need a deeper understanding of domain shift and its consequences, such that a model's predictions on new data can be trusted. This work focuses on the internal representation learned by trained convolutional neural networks, and shows how this can be used to formulate a novel measure - the representation shift - for quantifying the magnitude of model-specific domain shift. We perform a study on domain shift in tumor classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained images, by considering different datasets, models, and techniques for preparing data in order to reduce the domain shift. The results show how the proposed measure has a high correlation with drop in performance when testing a model across a large number of different types of domain shifts, and how it improves on existing techniques for measuring data shift and uncertainty. The proposed measure can reveal how sensitive a model is to domain variations, and can be used to detect new data that a model will have problems generalizing to.

10.1109/JBHI.2020.3008493,Medical Treatment Migration Prediction Based on GCN via Medical Insurance Data,IEEE,Journals,"Nowadays, prediction for medical treatment migration has become one of the interesting issues in the field of health informatics. This is because the medical treatment migration behavior is closely related to the evaluation of regional medical level, the rational use of medical resources, and the distribution of medical insurance. Therefore, a prediction model for medical treatment migration based on medical insurance data is introduced in this paper. First, a medical treatment graph is constructed based on medical insurance data. The medical treatment graph is a heterogeneous graph, which contains entities such as patients, diseases, hospitals, medicines, hospitalization events, and the relations between these entities. However, existing graph neural networks are unable to capture the time-series relationships between event-type entities. To this end, a prediction model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed in this paper, namely, Event-involved GCN (EGCN). The proposed model aggregates conventional entities based on attention mechanism, and aggregates event-type entities based on a gating mechanism similar to LSTM. In addition, jumping connection is deployed to obtain the final node representation. In order to obtain embedded representations of medicines based on external information (medicine descriptions), an automatic encoder capable of embedding medicine descriptions is deployed in the proposed model. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on a real medical insurance data set. Experimental results show that our model's predictive ability is better than the best models available.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9138732/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2453153,Modified AHP for Gene Selection and Cancer Classification Using Type-2 Fuzzy Logic,IEEE,Journals,"This paper proposes a modification to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to select the most informative genes that serve as inputs to an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) for cancer classification. Unlike the conventional AHP, the modified AHP allows us to process quantitative factors that are ranking outcomes of individual gene selection methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test, and signal-to-noise ratio. The IT2FLS is introduced for the classification task due to its great ability for handling nonlinear, noisy, and outlier data, which are common problems in cancer microarray gene expression profiles. An unsupervised learning strategy using the fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to initialize parameters of the IT2FLS. Other classifiers such as multilayer perceptron network, support vector machine, and fuzzy ARTMAP are also implemented for comparisons. Experiments are carried out on three well-known microarray datasets: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer, and prostate. Rather than the traditional cross validation, leave-one-out cross-validation strategy is applied for the experiments. Results demonstrate the performance dominance of the IT2FLS against the competing classifiers. More noticeably, the modified AHP improves the classification performance not only of the IT2FLS but of all other classifiers as well. Accordingly, the proposed combination between the modified AHP and IT2FLS is a powerful tool for cancer classification and can be implemented as a real clinical decision support system that is useful for medical practitioners.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150546/,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,April 2016,ieeexplore

While these devices offer many clinical benefits, there has been a recent increase in the number of cases, wherein, the wireless communication channel of such devices has been compromised. This not only causes the device to malfunction but also potentially threatens the patient's life. In this paper, a neural networks-based multi-layer perceptron model was designed for real-time medical device security. Machine learning algorithms are among the most effective and broadly utilized systems for classification, identification, and segmentation. Although they are effective, they are both computationally and memory intensive, making them hard to be deployed on low-power embedded frameworks. In this paper, we present an on-chip neural system network for securing diabetic treatment. The model achieved 98.1% accuracy in classifying fake versus genuine glucose measurements. The proposed model was comparatively evaluated with a linear support vector machine which achieved only 90.17% accuracy with negligible precision and recall.

This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F<sub>z</sub> 0.97, anterior Fy 0.96 (both running), and lateral Fx 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping).

The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study.

Learning generalizable features that can form universal categorical decision boundaries across domains is an interesting and difficult challenge. This problem occurs frequently in medical imaging applications when attempts are made to deploy and improve deep learning models across different image acquisition devices, across acquisition parameters or if some classes are unavailable in new training databases. To address this problem, we propose Mutual Information-based Disentangled Neural Networks (MIDNet), which extract generalizable categorical features to transfer knowledge to unseen categories in a target domain. The proposed MIDNet adopts a semi-supervised learning paradigm to alleviate the dependency on labeled data. This is important for real-world applications where data annotation is time-consuming, costly and requires training and expertise. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on fetal ultrasound datasets for two different image classification tasks where domain features are respectively defined by shadow artifacts and image acquisition devices.

Generally, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be collected from a large number of users and contain sensitive information (e.g., users' photos and medical information). The collected data would be stored and computed by service providers (SPs) or delegated to an untrusted cloud. The users can neither control how it will be used, nor realize what will be learned from it, which make the privacy issues prominent and severe. To solve the privacy issues, one of the most popular approaches is to encrypt users' data with their public keys. However, this technique inevitably leads to another challenge that how to train the model based on multi-key encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving deep learning model, namely PDLM, to apply deep learning over the encrypted data under multiple keys.

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities.

Early readmission prediction enables early intervention, which is essential to preventing serious or life-threatening events, and act as a substantial contributor to reduce healthcare costs. Existing works on predicting readmission often focus on certain vital signs and diseases by extracting statistical features. They also fail to consider skewness of class labels in medical data and different costs of misclassification errors. In this paper, we recur to the merits of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn features from time series of vital sign, and categorical feature embedding to effectively encode feature vectors with heterogeneous clinical features, such as demographics, hospitalization history, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Then, both learnt features via CNN and statistical features via feature embedding are fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for prediction. We use a cost-sensitive formulation to train MLP during prediction to tackle the imbalance and skewness challenge. We validate the proposed approach on two real medical datasets from Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and all data is taken from historical EMR databases and reflects the kinds of data that would realistically be available at the clinical prediction system in hospitals. We find that early prediction of readmission is possible and when compared with state-of-the-art existing methods used by hospitals, our methods perform significantly better. For example, using the general hospital wards data for 30-day readmission prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for the proposed model was 0.70, significantly higher than all the baseline methods.

Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area.

In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production. Therefore, we designed a lightweight edge computing-based distributed system using Raspberry Pi tailed for this need, and we optimized the data transfer and components deployment.

However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals.

Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

Semi-supervised methods leverage this issue by making use of a small labeled dataset and a larger set of unlabeled data. In this paper, we present a flexible framework for semi-supervised learning that combines the power of supervised methods that learn feature representations using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks with the deeply embedded clustering algorithm that assigns data points to clusters based on their probability distributions and feature representations learned by the networks. Our proposed semi-supervised learning algorithm based on deeply embedded clustering (SSLDEC) learns feature representations via iterations by alternatively using labeled and unlabeled data points and computing target distributions from predictions. During this iterative procedure, the algorithm uses labeled samples to keep the model consistent and tuned with labeling, as it simultaneously learns to improve feature representation and predictions. The SSLDEC requires a few hyper-parameters and thus does not need large labeled validation sets, which addresses one of the main limitations of many semi-supervised learning algorithms. It is also flexible and can be used with many state-of-the-art deep neural network configurations for image classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we implemented and tested our approach on benchmark image classification tasks as well as in a challenging medical image segmentation scenario. In benchmark classification tasks, the SSLDEC outperformed several state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, achieving 0.46% error on MNIST with 1000 labeled points and 4.43% error on SVHN with 500 labeled points.

Depending on the system and its applications, visual content received by the surgeons differs in perceived quality, which may incur implications for the performance of telesurgery tasks. To rigorously study the assessment of the quality of telesurgery videos, we performed both qualitative and quantitative research, consisting of semi-structured interviews and video quality scoring with human subjects. Statistical analyses are conducted and results show that compression artifacts and transmission errors significantly affect the perceived quality; and the effects tend to depend on the specific surgical procedure, visual content, frame rate, and the degree of distortion. The findings of the study are readily applicable to improving telesurgery systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7927709/,IEEE Access,2017,ieeexplore

Fog-computing radio access network (F-RAN) is a newly developed network paradigm, in which the edge devices perform the storage, communication, control, configuration and management. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered to be a hopeful multiple access mechanism for future radio access networks (RANs). The distinctive feature of NOMA is to assign the same channel for various users simultaneously by utilizing the power domain. With the deployment of NOMA, F-RAN can further promote system throughput, time latency, access capability and spectrum efficiency. The coordination between NOMA and F-RAN provides powerful support to extensive application of augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), vehicular networking, intelligent medical and other emerging applications. In this paper, we focus on a noncooperative game resource optimization to decrease the complexity while the dynamic optimization problem is decoupled to subchannel assignment and power allocation. Matching theory is applied to propose a subchannel assignment scheme. Then, we convert and decouple the power allocation problem into three subproblems and solve them separately at each slot. Simulation results illustrate the potency of the proposed noncooperative resource allocation scheme.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9339881/,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,June 2021,ieeexplore

Embodied learning can occur by watching an individual's body movement and also via human-computer interactions, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). In this article, we designed and implemented a novel virtual body-ownership AR/VR tool for human anatomy-the human muscular arm avatar (HMAA). HMAA utilizes embodiment-based body ownership to explore the human hand/forearm musculature. The HMAA was trialed with medical students to explore the extent to which it could be used to aid student learning. The key findings of the usability study suggest that 98% (N = 100) of students found the tool extremely useful; 83% reported that the tool allowed them to engage with the learning materials, peers, and content effectively. Also, 10% of students mentioned that the HMAA fostered an embodied learning experience. This triggered an intentional exploration of instances suggesting embodiment in the data. HMAA is believed to have allowed individuals to visualize and conceptualize abstract ideas that would have been otherwise challenging using static models. The outcomes of this article indicate the significant potential of body-ownership-based self-learning tools for anatomy.

The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949497/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

And the situation is exacerbated by the properties of velocity, variety and volume (3Vs) of big data. To recovery the system from performance anomaly, the first step is to find the root causes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature-based performance diagnosis approach to rapidly pinpoint the root causes of performance problems in big data platforms. The performance diagnosis is formalized as a pattern recognition problem. We leverage Maximum Information Criterion (MIC) to express the invariant relationships amongst the performance metrics in the normal state. Each performance problem occurred in the big data platform is signified by a unique binary vector named signature, which consists of a set of violations of MIC invariants. The signatures of multiple performance problems form a signature database. If the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the big data application exhibits model drift, our approach can identify the real culprits by retrieving the root causes which have similar signatures to the current performance problem. Moreover, considering the diversity of big data applications, we establish an ensemble approach to treat each application separately.

10.1109/ICATCCT.2016.7912031,Bearing fault diagnosis using discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Network,IEEE,Conferences,"Rotating machinery has vast industrial applications in fields of petroleum, automotive, HVAC and food processing. Rotating machineries use bearings to perform rotational or linear movement of various subcomponents while reducing friction and stress. Compared other types of bearing, REBs offer a good balance of key attributes like friction, lifetime, stiffness, speed and cost. Hence, real-time monitoring and diagnosis of bearings is crucial to prevent failures, improve safety, avoid unforeseen downtime of production assembly lines and lower cost. We propose an approach based on Wavelet Transform and ANN for analysis of vibration signals from a rolling element bearing to identify and multi-classify its component defects. The vibration signals from the REB being analyzed are passed over to the software setup consisting of Wavelet Transform and ANN. To remove noise and extract the relevant features from this signal, we pass the vibration signal through a Wavelet transform. These features are retrieved using time domain parameters like Skewness, Kurtosis, RMS and Crest Factor and they are used as an input for ANN classifier. The role of the ANN is to classify the bearing fault features produced by the Wavelet Transform and identify bearing faults, if any. To this end, we have designed a feedforward topology ANN using the sigmoid transfer function. The ANN training methodology uses three learning paradigms - namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient Back-propogation and Scaled Conjugate method. The learning models generated by each algorithm are tested to find the one which gives better accuracy. The outcome of this experiment indicates that DWT and ANN can together achieve good accuracy and reliability in detection and classification of bearing faults.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7912031/,2016 2nd International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Computing and Communication Technology (iCATccT),21-23 July 2016,ieeexplore

Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault and Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: (1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; (2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures.

In recent years, with the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), many researchers have focused on diagnose diseases by mining EMRs. They apply machine learning algorithms to train EMRs, and modify models to improve the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. However, these studies input the patient characteristics into the model at once, without multiple online interactions. Or, put another way, although those methods have performed well in the laboratory, they are not suitable for a real consultation environment. In the real world, doctors often guide patients to describe the condition step by step, and then combine the checkup value to diagnose the disease.

The medical knowledge graph is built by crawling 100K web pages, which help users improve the description of disease characteristics. We use q-learning to find the combination of symptoms in the best diagnosis and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train each strategy.

Majority of the faults which occur in induction motors are mainly diagnosed using motor current signature analysis. However, the accuracy of fault detection depends on selection of suitable features from motor current, the failure of which may result in incorrect interpretation. Considering the aforesaid fact, this paper presents an image processing aided deep learning framework for reliable diagnosis of induction motor faults, which eliminates the need of separate feature extraction stage. To this end, the motor current signals under different types of fault conditions were procured and were subsequently processed into frequency occurrence plots. The frequency occurrence image plots for different fault scenarios were finally used as inputs to a deep convolution neural network for the purpose of classification. Transfer learning technique was adopted to reduce the computation time of Convolution Neural Network and classification of motor faults was done at five different loading conditions. Four types of classification tasks have been addressed here and comprehensive analysis was done using a variety of CNN architectures.

However, in the current research, the diagnosis process is based on an assumption that the same feature distribution exists between training data and testing data. Regrettably, in real application, training data and testing data are often from diverse domains, the difference in feature distributions is often prevalent; in this case, the traditional diagnostic models lack adaptability. To address this issue, this work proposed a diagnosis framework based on domain adaptation. This framework is inspired by the domain adaptation ability of transfer learning, in that the model trained by the labeled data in source domain can be transferred to diagnose a new but similar target data. The domain adaptation algorithm transfer component analysis (TCA) and its improved algorithm- improved transfer component analysis (ITCA) are embedded into this framework, respectively, to verify its applicability.

Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data.

When the training error for two successive steps is very little, then the number of inputs in network is increased. If the spectral components are zero for sufficient time, then the number of inputs is decreased. The Hausdorff distance is proposed for spectrum classification as the distance measure for the frequency domain in a pattern recognition context. It shown that the Hausdorff distance has a monotone relationship with the signal-to-noise-ratio. Finally, the possibility of decreasing the number of spectrum components as patterns is presented, by compression with neural networks. Spectral representations of the acoustic source show that signatures collected at rolling mill sensor locations can be successfully used to identify process and structural changes in the rolling mill monitoring system. The results obtained by simulation is encouraging for real-time implementation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/607526/,Fifth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (Conf. Publ.

The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into a knowledge-based expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line past-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the case of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, hypothesis resting on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts. A working prototype for this hybrid diagnostic system is being implemented on the Plasma Therm 700 series reactive ion etcher located in the Georgia Tech Microelectronic Research Center.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/526119/,Seventeenth IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium.

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices.

The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device.

Then, CNN was employed to extract informative features from FDS results of the OIP bushing, which is sensitive to both concentrations and sources of moisture. Finally, HMMs were further utilized as a strong stability tool to recognize the damp status of OIP bushings. The proposed method was implemented to identify the bushing damp status using both simulation data and real-life measurements. Identification results demonstrate that the proposed method has high accuracy in determining the moisture level and moisture source of the OIP bushing insulation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9306924/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIM.2021.3088489,A Hybrid Generalization Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Under Unseen Working Conditions,IEEE,Journals,"The data-driven methods in machinery fault diagnosis have become increasingly popular in the past two decades. However, the wide applications of this scheme are generally compromised in real-world conditions because of the discrepancy between the training data and testing data. Although the recently emerging transfer fault diagnosis can learn transferable features from relevant source data and adapt the diagnostic model to the target data, these methods still only work on the target domain with a priori data distribution. The generalization capability of the transferred model cannot be guaranteed for unseen domains. Since the working conditions of machinery are varying during operation, the generalization capability of the diagnosis methods is crucial in this case. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a domain generalization-based hybrid diagnosis network for deploying to unseen working conditions. The main idea is to regularize the discriminant structure of the deep network with both intrinsic and extrinsic generalization objectives such that the diagnostic model can learn robust features and generalize to unseen domains. The triplet loss minimization of intrinsic multisource data is implemented to facilitate the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability at the class level, leading to a more generalized decision boundary. The extrinsic domain-level regularization is achieved by using adversarial training to further reduce the risk of overfitting. Extensive cross-domain diagnostic experiments on planetary gearbox demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9452118/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2021,ieeexplore

In some cases, the rotating machinery has long rotor, it need to arrange multiple sensors at different positions of the system and different faults are located at different positions of the system. The primary difficult issue involved in the task is to recognize the multiple faults at different positions of ball screw with high accuracy and feasibility. In order to overcome the problem, a novel method for ball screw fault diagnosis is proposed. The proposed method combines weighted data of the multiple sensors at different positions with convolutional neural network and it considers the sensitive index of different faults at different sensors for weight assignment. The proposed method mainly contains three steps. Firstly, a new data segmentation algorithm is proposed to obtain the uniform data of the vibration signals. Secondly, a sensitive sensor data selection criterion based on ball screw failure mechanism is developed to obtain the sensor importance factor. Finally, the weighted data is classified by the convolutional neural network.

10.1109/JSYST.2019.2921867,A Smart Optimization of Fault Diagnosis in Electrical Grid Using Distributed Software-Defined IoT System,IEEE,Journals,"Electrical power demands have increased significantly over the last years due to rapid increase in air conditioning units and home appliances per domestic unit, particularly in Iraq. Having an uninterrupted power supply is essential for the continuity of power-generated home services and industrial platforms. Currently, in Iraq, electrical power interruption has become a big concern to the utility suppliers. Despite successive attempts to put an end to this dilemma, the issue still prevails. One of the main factors in power outages in local zones is persistent faults in distribution transformers (DTs). DT is considered one of the main elements in the electrical network that is essential for the reliability of the grid supply. Due to the internal lack of monitoring system and periodic maintenance, DT is relentlessly subject to faults due to high overhead utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance the grid reliability, transformer health check, and maintenance practices, we propose a remote condition Internet of Things monitoring and fault prediction system that is based on a customized software-defined networking (SDN) technology. This approach is a transition to smart grid implementation by fusing the power grid with efficient and real-time wireless communication architecture. The SDN implementation is considered in two phases: one is a controller installed per local zone and the other is the main controller that is installed between zones and connected to the core network. The core network consists of redundant links to recover from any future fails. Furthermore, we propose a prediction system based on an artificial neural network algorithm, called distribution transformer fault prediction, that is installed in the management plane for periodic prediction based on real-time sensor traffic to our proposed cloud. Moreover, we propose a communication protocol in the local zone called local SDN-sense. The SDN-sense ensures a reliable communication and local node selection to relay DT sensor data to the main controller. Our proposed architecture showcases an efficient approach to handle future interruption and faults in power grid using cost-effective and reliable infrastructure that can predict and provide real-time health monitoring indices for the Iraqi grid network with minimal power interruptions.

Aiming at improving the resolution and accuracy of MDEIT and providing an efficient imaging method for breast cancer diagnosis, a new algorithm based on stacked auto-encoder (SAE) neural network is proposed. Both numerical simulation and phantom experiments are done to verify its feasibility. In the numerical simulation, an amount of sample data with different conductivity distribution are calculated. Then a neural network model is established and trained by training these samples. Finally, the conductivity distribution of an imaging target with the anomaly location can be reconstructed by the network model. The reconstruction result of the SAE algorithm is compared with the reconstruction results of the traditional sensitivity matrix (SM) algorithm and the back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. Under the noise of 30dB, the relative errors of BP algorithm, SM algorithm and SAE algorithm are 137.19%, 24.90% and 15.28% respectively. Result shows by the SAE algorithm, the location of anomalies is reconstructed more accurately, the conductivity value is more closely to the real one and the anti-noise performance is more robust. At last, a breast phantom experiment by self-made platforms is completed to verify the application feasibility of the new algorithm.

However, traditional fault diagnosis methods usually adopt manual feature extraction, which not only costs expensively and depends on prior knowledge. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of automatic fault identification based on the original vibration signals. Recently, existing studies have shown that most of fault diagnoses are implemented by using deep neural network. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performances, there are obvious limitations in real applications, that is, the complexity of deep neural network requires a lot of hardware computing resources. This hinders the development of online fault diagnosis tools. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet, and realizes an end-to-end intelligent fault classification and diagnosis application.

The importance of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to diagnose diabetes has led to extensive research efforts to improve the accuracy, applicability, interpretability, and interoperability of these systems. However, this problem continues to require optimization. Fuzzy rule-based systems are suitable for the medical domain, where interpretability is a main concern. The medical domain is data-intensive, and using electronic health record data to build the FRBS knowledge base and fuzzy sets is critical. Multiple variables are frequently required to determine a correct and personalized diagnosis, which usually makes it difficult to arrive at accurate and timely decisions. In this paper, we propose and implement a new semantically interpretable FRBS framework for diabetes diagnosis. The framework uses multiple aspects of knowledge-fuzzy inference, ontology reasoning, and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) to provide a more intuitive and accurate design. First, we build a two-layered hierarchical and interpretable FRBS; then, we improve this by integrating an ontology reasoning process based on SNOMED CT standard ontology. We incorporate FAHP to determine the relative medical importance of each sub-FRBS. The proposed system offers numerous unique and critical improvements regarding the implementation of an accurate, dynamic, semantically intelligent, and interpretable CDSS.

However, since EEG signals are highly complex, nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, both visual inspection and the existing computed aid detection approaches fail to capture the intrinsic dynamics of seizure events, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. Therefore, an accurate computer-aided automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis system is valuable and urgently needed in clinical application. In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%.

Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques.

Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles.

Machine learning-based methods are increasingly being used for fault diagnosis applications. However, the performance of such detection algorithms will degrade because of variations between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation of the field. Furthermore, the fault's data in the target domain for model training are usually not available.

Then by generating dummy arcing data with the learned transformation using the normal data from the target domain and employing domain adaptation, a robust and reliable fault diagnosis scheme can be achieved for the target domain.

Meanwhile, the widely used traditional data generation methods for the imbalanced data problem are limited by data dependencies over time continuity. To fill this research gap, this paper develops a new diagnostic framework based on the adversarial neural networks (GAN) and multi-sensor data fusion technique to generate new synthetic data for data compensation purpose. Two different practice modes are designed based on this framework according to the position logic of the data fusion, namely a Pre-fusion GAN mode and a Post-fusion GAN mode. More concretely, without data pre-processing, the designed generator generates synthetic data to puzzle the discriminator and the synthetic data that out-trick the discriminator can be used to compensate the minor class. To avoid data dependency and to ensure the generality of the proposed framework, the network modelling are trained with a more practical approach where the training and test data are obtained under different rotating speeds. Two imbalanced data sets on the rotating machinery, one benchmark public rolling bearing data set and another gear box data set acquired in our lab, are used to validate the proposed method. The performance is examined through a wide range of data imbalanced ratios (as high as 30:1), and compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

More importantly, it presents a systematic way of constructing rTFPGs by combining the powers of human experts and data-driven methods: first, an expert constructs a partial rTFPG based on his/her expertise; then a data-driven algorithm refines the rTFPG by adding nodes and edges based on a given set of labeled signals. The proposed approach has been successfully implemented and evaluated on three case studies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9142280/,IEEE Control Systems Letters,July 2021,ieeexplore

It is always a major challenge to ensure fault diagnosis accuracy in particular under severe working conditions. In this article, a deep adversarial domain adaptation (DADA) model is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. This model constructs an adversarial adaptation network to solve the commonly encountered problem in numerous real applications: the source domain and the target domain are inconsistent in their distribution. First, a deep stack autoencoder (DSAE) is combined with representative feature learning for dimensionality reduction, and such a combination provides an unsupervised learning method to effectively acquire fault features. Meanwhile, domain adaptation and recognition classification are implemented using a Softmax classifier to augment classification accuracy. Second, the effects of the number of hidden layers in the stack autoencoder network, the number of neurons in each hidden layer, and the hyperparameters of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm are analyzed.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073670,Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Resource Block Usage Rate for Spectrum Saturation Diagnosis,IEEE,Journals,"Strict restrictions on spectrum utilization and the rapid increases in mobile users have brought fundamental challenges for mobile network operators in securing sufficient spectrum resources. In designing reliable cellular networks, it is essential to predict spectrum saturation events in the future by analyzing the past behavior of base stations, especially their frequency resource block (RB) utilization states. This paper investigates a deep learning-based forecasting strategy of the future RB usage rate (RBUR) status of hundreds of LTE base stations deployed in Seoul, South Korea. The dataset consists of real measurement RBUR samples with a randomly varying number of base stations at each measurement time. This poses a difficulty in handling variable-length RBUR data vectors, which is not trivial for state-of-the-art deep learning estimation models, e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNNs), developed for handling fixed-length inputs. To this end, we propose a two-step RBUR estimation approach. In the first step, we extract a useful feature of the RBUR dataset that accurately approximates the behavior of the top quantile base stations. The feature parameters are carefully designed to be fixed-length vectors regardless of the dimensions of the raw RBUR samples. The fixed-length feature parameter vectors are readily exploited as the training dataset of RNN-based prediction models. Thus, in the second step, we propose a feature estimation strategy where the RNN is trained to predict the future RBUR from the input feature parameter sequences. With the estimated RBUR at hand, we can easily predict the spectrum saturation of the future LTE systems by examining the resource utilization states of the top quantile base stations. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the proposed RBUR estimation methods with the real measurement dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9406027/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

However, in many real-world fault diagnosis applications, the distribution of the source domain data (on which the model is trained) is different from the distribution of the target domain data (where the learned model is actually deployed), which leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce domain adaptation, which can find the solution to this problem by adapting the classifier or the regression model trained in a source domain for use in a different but related target domain. In particular, we proposed a novel deep neural network model with domain adaptation for fault diagnosis. Two main contributions are concluded by comparing to the previous works: first, the proposed model can utilize domain adaptation meanwhile strengthening the representative information of the original data, so that a high classification accuracy in the target domain can be achieved, and second, we proposed several strategies to explore the optimal hyperparameters of the model.

This research aims to develop a drill fault detection system using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques. Many researchers have applied the traditional approach design for an MFD system, including handcrafted feature extraction of the raw sound signal, feature selection, and conventional classification. However, drill sound fault detection based on conventional machine learning methods using the raw sound signal in the time domain faces a number of challenges. For example, it can be difficult to extract and select good features to input in a classifier, and the accuracy of fault detection may not be sufficient to meet industrial requirements.

Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation.

Recently, ultrasound contrast agents (UCA) and contrast-specific imaging methods have substantially improved the characterization of FLL. This was made possible by the known differences in dynamic vascular patterns (DVP) between healthy parenchyma and various FLL types, revealed by UCA. The purpose of this work was to develop a new method, called DVP processing, which provides a DVP-enhanced imaging mode of FLL using contrast ultrasound; this mode allows an improved differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. DVP processing consists in generating a sequence of images, where hyper-echoic and hypo- echoic pixels, compared to reference levels taken in healthy parenchyma, are coded over time in warm and cold colors, respectively. For example, a benign lesion remains hyper-echoic over time, while a malignant lesion is hyper-echoic in the arterial phase and turns into hypo-echoic in the portal phase. This method was implemented as an image-processing software program, which was the object of clinical evaluation. Sequences of 111 FLL were acquired with real-time low-MI contrast- specific ultrasound after a 2.5-mL bolus injection of SonoVuetrade, and subsequently analyzed off-fine with DVP processing. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by two clinical observers in this way were 92%, and 86%, respectively.

Unlike still images, video images contain many color shifts, blurs, reflections, and so on, a classification method that takes these noises into account is indispensable. In this paper, in the framework of Bag-of-Feature (BoF), we use a pre-learned convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with general images as feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classification. A robust classification method for endoscopic video is proposed by relearning SVM with several sets of endoscopic images. In addition, since CNN and SVM need to perform many multiplication and accumulation (MAC) operations, we implement the hardware system on a customizable DSP, which can be realize at high speed MAC operations and parallel processing with Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW). The prototyped system can be achieved real-time processing on video frame rate (30 fps @ 200 MHz).

It allows to continuously monitor patients without restricting their movements and to inform the health specialist of the evolution of their states. However, the deployment of new technologies in health applications without taking into account data security makes the privacy of patients vulnerable. Thus, these systems have insufficient performance for large and varied data sets, because they do not process information sufficiently diverse to cover all scenarios. Moreover, the interpretation of physiological signals is a tedious process in which human errors can be caused.To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an effective health system that ensures the secure collection and transfer of patient data to the physician, to facilitate the diagnosis and the detection of life threatening diseases. Our main contribution is to offer real-time, high quality processing, learning and analysis capabilities, in a smart and secure system. For that, we have collected real patient datasets from Tunisian doctors.To achieve this goal, we used ANN and XgBoost as learning algorithms and AES as an encryption protocol for sending secure data to medical personnel for diagnostic purposes.

The proposed approach consists of three main steps. Firstly, a texture analysis is applied onto input abdominal CT images to extract pixel level features. Here, two main categories of features, namely wavelet coefficients and Haralick texture descriptors are investigated. Secondly, support vector machines (SVM) are implemented to classify the data into pixel-wised liver or non-liver. Finally, specially combined morphological operations are designed as a post processor to remove noise and to delineate the liver. Our unique contributions to liver segmentation are twofold: one is that it has been proved through experiments that wavelet features present better classification than Haralick texture descriptors when SVMs are used; the other is that the combination of morphological operations with a pixel-wised SVM classifier can delineate volumetric liver accurately. The algorithm can be used in an advanced computer-aided liver disease diagnosis and surgical planning systems.

10.1109/NSS/MIC42677.2020.9507799,A New Image Reconstruction Technique with Limited View-angle Projection Data for BNCT-SPECT,IEEE,Conferences,"This study proposed a novel image reconstruction technique using Bayesian estimation for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) with limited view-angle projection data, and compered the performance with the existing method, ML-EM. BNCT requires real-time visualization of therapeutic effects, that is, output of reconstructed images to show local boron dose. Since BNCT-SPECT is a treatment, not a diagnosis, there are limits related to projection angle and measuring time. It should be noted that in BNCT-SPECT, unlike normal image reconstruction like Xray CT, the accuracy of each pixel value (dose) is more important than the structural similarity to the true image. This is because the most crucial estimate value is the patient's exposure dose in the normal cells. Therefore, we devised a method using Bayesian estimation as an image reconstruction method that could reproduce an individual pixel value accurately. As a result of numerical simulation, it was found that the proposed method is superior to the ML-EM method in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). As the next step, we are planning to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the measurement data acquired in the experiment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9507799/,2020 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC),31 Oct.-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

The paper discusses the potential for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into an application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for condition monitoring. The paper is a continuation of the work presented by the authors at the IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference in Calgary. The proposed asset management system analyses condition monitoring (CM) data and assesses the risk of failure data across complete HV networks. Knowledge of deteriorating asset condition provides the operator with an advanced, early warning of incipient mechanical and electrical faults. With knowledge of the severity and source of such faults, pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions can then made during planned maintenance outages. The complete HV network asset monitoring solution described includes permanent sensors and monitoring nodes deployed at strategic locations across the network. Processed data is passed via a local area network to local servers and then via secure data cloud transmission to a centralized monitoring server located at the CM headquarters. This central server operates a CM database that logs, displays, benchmarks and trends the condition data with comparison to a statistically-significant database of measurements. It is proposed in the IIoT solution proposed that this database will be downloadable to a smartphone/tablet for use by the field engineer. The monitoring technology will likely also incorporate a number of AI machine learning software modules for the de-noising of raw signals and the diagnosis of different types of defects within different types of HV plant items. The proposed SMART CM system includes an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing HV asset CM data along with operational and maintenance (O&amp;M) data. The GUI will also be able to display both condition criticality and operational criticality (on a color-coded range of 0-100%) for individual HV plant items on a digitized mimic of the HV network's single-line diagram (SLD). This could also be combined with geometric positioning data of assets across the facility (including HV cable routes and lengths) to provide a fully digitized SMART network diagram for use in the IIoT asset management solution. Asset management data, combined with the application of the developing techniques of AI, AR and VR, will greatly help the user to visualize the plant items in 3-D, their position within the network, their condition and operational criticality along with all related asset management information together on one dashboard screen, downloaded onto smartphone/tablet.

Subjective segmentations are widely adopted in clinical diagnosis and treating, but they are neither accurate nor reliable. An automatical and objective system for brain tumor segmentation is strongly expected.

The preprocessing is used to extract image patches for each MR image and obtains the gray level sequences of image patches as the input of the deep learning network. The deep learning network based classification is implemented by a stacked auto-encoder network to extract the high level abstract feature from the input, and utilizes the extracted feature to classify image patches. After mapping the classification result to a binary image, the post-processing is implemented by a morphological filter to get the final segmentation result.

Decentralization/distributed solutions can solve some of these problems (Goldszmidt, G. and Yemini, Y., 1995), and thus there is considerable interest in distributed/decentralized network management applications. We present the design and evaluation of an SNMP-based distributed network fault detection/monitoring system. We integrate into the SNMP framework our ML-ADSD algorithm (Su, M.-S. et al., Proc. 39th Annual Allerton Conf. on Commun., Control, and Computers, 2001; Su, ""Multilevel distributed diagnosis and the design of a distributed network fault detection system based on the SNMP protocol"", Ph.D. Thesis, School of Computer Science, University of Oklahoma, 2002) for fault diagnosis in a distributed processor system. The algorithm uses the multilevel paradigm and requires only minor modifications to be scalable to networks of varying sizes. The system is fault tolerant, allowing processor failure and/or recovery during the diagnosis process. We have implemented the system on an Ethernet network of 32 machines. Our results show that the diagnosis latency (or time to termination) is much better than that of earlier solutions. Also, the system's bandwidth utilization is insignificant, demonstrating the practicality of its deployment in a real network.

The power data has characteristics of big data and unlike big data of other types, it has the advantage of applying efficient and useful services by applying various analysis and prediction techniques without any additional data processing. Despite these advantages, the field of automated meter reading still focuses on the construction of the system, so data analysis and application aren't actively implemented. However, the auto metering infrastructure is being installed continuously and the amount of data is continuously increasing. Therefore, the importance of utilization of power data based on the auto metering infrastructure becomes an issue, and research on power big data analysis and data mining is actively being carried out. In this paper, we have performed a probabilistic analysis, diagnosis, and prediction of the fault condition of the system through application of the artificial intelligent deep learning algorithm using the system state data stored in real time in the low voltage meter reading system.

It needs to be monitored to ensure the safety of railway operations. In the literature, image processing techniques that can localize BSs from inspection images are proposed. However, the boxes produced by existing methods can contain incomplete and/or irrelevant information of the localized BS. This reduces the accuracy of BS condition diagnosis in further analyses. To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of an action-driven reinforcement learning method that adopts the coarse-localized box provided by existing methods, and finds the movements needed for the box to approach to the true BS position automatically and accurately. In contrast to the existing methods that predict one position of the box containing a BS, the proposed action-driven method sees the localization problem as a dynamic position searching process. The localization of BS is achieved by following a sequence of actions, which in this paper are position-moving (up, down, left or right), scale-changing (scale up or scale down) and shape-changing (fatter or taller). The policy of selecting dynamic actions is obtained by reinforcement learning. In the experiment, the proposed method is tested with real-life images taken from a high-speed line in China. The results show that our method can effectively improve the localization accuracy for 81.8% of the analyzed images.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

In recent years, the deep learning techniques greatly improve the fault detection accuracy, but there still remain some problems. If one fault is absent in the training data or the fault signal is disturbed by severe noise interference, the fault classifier may misjudge the health state. This problem limits the reliability of the fault diagnosis in real applications. In this paper, we enhance the fault diagnosis method by using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN). A Shannon entropy-based method is presented to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The BCNN turns the deterministic predictions to probabilistic distributions and enhances the robustness of the fault diagnosis. The uncertainty quantification method helps to indicate the wrong predictions, detect unknown faults, and discover the strong disturbances. Then, a fine-tuning strategy is applied to enhance the model performance further. The potential usability of the proposed method in monitoring the motors of 3D printers is studied. And the experiment is conducted on a motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The proposed BCNN achieves 99.82% fault classification accuracy over nine health conditions.

And the situation is exacerbated by the properties of velocity, variety and volume (3Vs) of big data. To recovery the system from performance anomaly, the first step is to find the root causes. In this paper, we propose a novel signature-based performance diagnosis approach to rapidly pinpoint the root causes of performance problems in big data platforms. The performance diagnosis is formalized as a pattern recognition problem. We leverage Maximum Information Criterion (MIC) to express the invariant relationships amongst the performance metrics in the normal state. Each performance problem occurred in the big data platform is signified by a unique binary vector named signature, which consists of a set of violations of MIC invariants. The signatures of multiple performance problems form a signature database. If the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of the big data application exhibits model drift, our approach can identify the real culprits by retrieving the root causes which have similar signatures to the current performance problem. Moreover, considering the diversity of big data applications, we establish an ensemble approach to treat each application separately. The experiment evaluations in a controlled big data platform show that our approach can pinpoint the real culprits of performance problems in an average 84% precision and 87% recall when one fault occurs, which is better than several state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359155/,2018 IEEE Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE),26-29 March 2018,ieeexplore

Misidentifying various diseases in agricultural crops can lead to significant economic loss and environmental impacts. Rice is the most predominant food crop in Bangladesh. It possesses around 75% of the grossed harvest area of the country. Early diagnosis of rice grain diseases can save tonnes of agricultural products every year. The traditional manual observation of the crop disease is time-consuming and less accurate. For addressing this issue, researchers have utilized different high-performing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that perform well in the disease classification tasks. But these networks have very complex architecture and not very much suitable for real-life applications. Moreover, there is a limitation of devices and stable connectivity in agricultural areas. So there requires a lightweight efficiency for applying the automated disease detection system. In this paper, we present a custom memory-efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) namely, RiceNet to automatically detect rice grain diseases.

Rotating machineries use bearings to perform rotational or linear movement of various subcomponents while reducing friction and stress. Compared other types of bearing, REBs offer a good balance of key attributes like friction, lifetime, stiffness, speed and cost. Hence, real-time monitoring and diagnosis of bearings is crucial to prevent failures, improve safety, avoid unforeseen downtime of production assembly lines and lower cost. We propose an approach based on Wavelet Transform and ANN for analysis of vibration signals from a rolling element bearing to identify and multi-classify its component defects. The vibration signals from the REB being analyzed are passed over to the software setup consisting of Wavelet Transform and ANN. To remove noise and extract the relevant features from this signal, we pass the vibration signal through a Wavelet transform. These features are retrieved using time domain parameters like Skewness, Kurtosis, RMS and Crest Factor and they are used as an input for ANN classifier. The role of the ANN is to classify the bearing fault features produced by the Wavelet Transform and identify bearing faults, if any. To this end, we have designed a feedforward topology ANN using the sigmoid transfer function. The ANN training methodology uses three learning paradigms - namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, Resilient Back-propogation and Scaled Conjugate method. The learning models generated by each algorithm are tested to find the one which gives better accuracy.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples.

We alleviate this problem and improve the quality of saliency maps by augmenting recurrent models with an attention mechanism. We validate our methodology on synthetic data and compare these results to previous work. This synthetic experiment quantitatively validate that our methodology effectively captures the underlying signal of the input data.

These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: (1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; (2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures. Finally, the potential challenges that come along with the implementation of Deep Learning technologies for industrial applications are discussed and future research directions are proposed.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8756423/,2019 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Paris),2-5 May 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SustainCom-SocialCom48970.2019.00187,DKDR: An Approach of Knowledge Graph and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Disease Diagnosis,IEEE,Conferences,"Using artificial intelligence to solve medical problems has been an intriguing yet challenging topic. In recent years, with the availability of electronic medical records (EMRs), many researchers have focused on diagnose diseases by mining EMRs. They apply machine learning algorithms to train EMRs, and modify models to improve the accuracy of diseases diagnosis. However, these studies input the patient characteristics into the model at once, without multiple online interactions. Or, put another way, although those methods have performed well in the laboratory, they are not suitable for a real consultation environment. In the real world, doctors often guide patients to describe the condition step by step, and then combine the checkup value to diagnose the disease. In this paper, we simulate this process and propose a novel system called DKDR, which combine a knowledge graph and deep reinforcement learning to diagnose disease. The medical knowledge graph is built by crawling 100K web pages, which help users improve the description of disease characteristics. We use q-learning to find the combination of symptoms in the best diagnosis and use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to train each strategy. Finally, we experiment on real medical datasets and synthetic medical datasets. DKDR finds the best combination of symptoms for diagnosing disease. The diagnostic accuracy rates for pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and obesity are 89%, 90% and 92%, respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9047423/,"2019 IEEE Intl Conf on Parallel & Distributed Processing with Applications, Big Data & Cloud Computing, Sustainable Computing & Communications, Social Computing & Networking (ISPA/BDCloud/SocialCom/SustainCom)",16-18 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Also the rapid development of deep learning segmentation and classification models alleviates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio and artifacts of ultrasonic imaging. However, due to the privacy issues of medical data, it is not easy to acquire sufficient data for deep learning model training. In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used in data augmentation. However, GANs suffer from the problem of mode collapse in the training process then generate images with a limited variety. On the other hand, variational auto-encoder (VAE) is free from mode collapse but it generates blurred images. In this work, we study an auto-encoding generative adversarial network combining the advantages of GAN and VAE to generate realistic images for medical thyroid ultrasound image augmentation. Experiment results show that the generated images can simulate realistic ultrasound features and thyroid tissues for augmentation and help training a U-Net model to get better segmentation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9593403/,2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),11-16 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

Not So Fast,IEEE,Conferences,"Data-driven models are now deployed in a plethora of real-world applications - including automated diagnosis - but models learned from data risk learning biases from that same data. When models learn spurious correlations not found in real-world situations, their deployment for critical tasks, such as medical decisions, can be catastrophic. In this work we address this issue for skin-lesion classification models, with two objectives: finding out what are the spurious correlations exploited by biased networks, and debiasing the models by removing such spurious correlations from them. We perform a systematic integrated analysis of 7 visual artifacts (which are possible sources of biases exploitable by networks), employ a state-of-the-art technique to prevent the models from learning spurious correlations, and propose datasets to test models for the presence of bias.

For machine health monitoring systems (MHMS), the major efforts have been put in designing and deploying more and more complex machine learning models which are also called as black-box models considering they are non-transparent towards their working mechanism. However, this research trend brings huge potential risk in real life. Since machine health monitoring itself is a high-stake decision scenario, the decision of the autonomous monitoring system should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: Why the deployed MHMS predict what they predict. In this paper, we shed some lights on this meaningful research direction: explainable machine health monitoring systems (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can only make diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named as DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), balances precision-explainability trade-off. Specifically, features and temporal information will be encoded in different stages of our model. Second, to explain the decision of the model, we adopt the gradient-based methods to generate features and temporal saliency maps highlighting which kind of features and time steps are key for the model's predictions.

Despite neural immaturity, seizures can also occur in preterm infants. However, surprisingly little is known about their evolution after an HI insult or patterns of expression. An improved understanding of preterm seizures will help facilitate diagnosis and prognosis and the implementation of treatments. This requires improved detection of seizures, including electrographic seizures. We have established a stable preterm fetal sheep model of HI that results in different types of post-HI seizures. These including the expression of epileptiform transients during the latent phase (0-6 h) of cerebral energy recovery, and bursts of high amplitude stereotypic evolving seizures (HAS) during the secondary phase of cerebral energy failure (~6-72 h). We have previously developed successful automated machine-learning strategies for accurate identification and quantification of the evolving micro-scale EEG patterns (e.g. gamma spikes and sharp waves), during the latent phase. The current paper introduces, for the first time, a real-time approach that employs a 15-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, directly fed with the raw EEG time-series, to identify HAS in the 1024Hz and 256Hz down-sampled data in our preterm fetuses post-HI. The classifier was trained and tested using EEG segments during ~6 to 48 hours post-HI recordings. The classifier accurately identified HAS with 98.52% accuracy in the 1024Hz and 97.78% in the 256Hz data.

However, wearable devices having real-time cardiac health monitoring aids individuals as well as medical professionals in the timely diagnosis of fatal heart diseases, such as arrhythmia.

To this end, the motor current signals under different types of fault conditions were procured and were subsequently processed into frequency occurrence plots. The frequency occurrence image plots for different fault scenarios were finally used as inputs to a deep convolution neural network for the purpose of classification. Transfer learning technique was adopted to reduce the computation time of Convolution Neural Network and classification of motor faults was done at five different loading conditions. Four types of classification tasks have been addressed here and comprehensive analysis was done using a variety of CNN architectures.

In this work, we propose EpiSense - a smart healthcare solution for epileptic patients' care. EpiSense leverages sensory, mobile, and web technologies, as well as machine learning techniques for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures. As part of the system, a patient's mobile app. is provided to allow the detection of seizures' occurrence in real time and the sending of alarm notifications to care takers, for appropriate actions. Moreover, a web portal enables doctors to view the progress of their patients and get notified about seizures' occurrence and statistics.

Incremental learning proves to be time as well as resource-efficient solution for deployment of deep learning algorithms in real world as the model can automatically and dynamically adapt to new data as and when annotated data becomes available. The development and deployment of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools in medical domain is another scenario, where incremental learning becomes very crucial as collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset spanning over multiple pathologies and imaging machines might take years. However, not much has so far been explored in this direction. In the current work, we propose a robust and efficient method for incremental learning in medical imaging domain. Our approach makes use of Hard Example Mining technique (which is commonly used as a solution to heavy class imbalance) to automatically select a subset of dataset to fine-tune the existing network weights such that it adapts to new data while retaining existing knowledge.

The difficulty stems from the fact that most implemented diagnostic services for time-triggered systems employ the prior knowledge of the schedule to provide diagnosis. However, at the beginning of the startup process, when the global time base is not yet established, these diagnostic services are not viable. This work proposes the use of a fault injection framework to generate data that resembles the behaviour of failed components during startup. The data generated can then be used for developing fault diagnostic mechanisms.

10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9344971,Federated Learning for Arrhythmia Detection of Non-IID ECG,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper, a distributed arrhythmia detection algorithm based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is proposed for auxiliary diagnosis and treatment. ECG that contains tremendous cardiac rhythm information plays an important role in clinical treatment. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can effectively build the relationship between ECG and the underlying arrhythmia in it. Due to the privacy sensitivity of the ECG, we introduced a federated learning (FL)-based distributed algorithm that enables each medical institution to cooperatively train a arrhythmia detection algorithm locally. Compared with the traditional centralized ML algorithms, the use of FL-based algorithm does not need to collect all the local ECG of each medical institution to an external platform to perform centralized learning, and hence preventing the privacy from leakage. However, ECG collected from different medical institution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) in reality, which will lead to non convergence of the FL-based algorithm. To address this challenge, we optimize the FL-based algorithm using a sharing strategy for partial ECG data of each medical institution combined with elastic weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm. Here, the sharing strategy, which makes each medical institution share ECG data to the central server while not share to other clients, could help build an initial FL model and EWC algorithm make the accuracy of the model trained by each medical institution not decline, therefore the proposed FL algorithm can achieve a trade-off between the privacy and model performance. The experiment results show that, compared with baseline FedAvg algorithm and FedCurv algorithm, the optimized FL-based algorithm is faster in convergence for IID ECG and achieves signicant improvement in terms of both recall and precision for non-IID ECG.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9344971/,2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),11-14 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Due to its direct impact on Central Nervous System if tumor cells prevail at certain locations in the brain, the overall functionality of the body is disturbed and chances of a person approaching death accelerate. Tumors can be cancerous or non-cancerous but in many cases, the chances of complete recovery are less and as a result death rate has increased all over the world despite recent advancements in technology, equipment and awareness. So the main concern is to detect brain related diseases at early stages so that it does not spread into vital parts of brain and disrupt body functions. Also, more precise and accurate technologies are required to serve as aid in diagnosis, treatment and surgery of brain. Therefore, its high alarming time to monitor mortality statistics and develop faster and accurate methods to curb the situation by simulating tissue deformation and locating cancerous nodes which is a good area of research.

10.1109/SAFEPROCESS45799.2019.9213378,Improved Transfer Component Analysis and It Application for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Across Diverse Domains,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent years, intelligent fault diagnosis models based on machine learning used for intelligent condition monitoring and diagnosis have achieved considerable success. However, in the current research, the diagnosis process is based on an assumption that the same feature distribution exists between training data and testing data. Regrettably, in real application, training data and testing data are often from diverse domains, the difference in feature distributions is often prevalent; in this case, the traditional diagnostic models lack adaptability. To address this issue, this work proposed a diagnosis framework based on domain adaptation. This framework is inspired by the domain adaptation ability of transfer learning, in that the model trained by the labeled data in source domain can be transferred to diagnose a new but similar target data. The domain adaptation algorithm transfer component analysis (TCA) and its improved algorithm- improved transfer component analysis (ITCA) are embedded into this framework, respectively, to verify its applicability. An experiment was conducted on the datasets of bearing to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the proposed transfer framework. The results show that the proposed method presents high accuracy in the transfer task of bearing fault diagnosis under different conditions across diverse experimental positions and fault types.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9213378/,"2019 CAA Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes (SAFEPROCESS)",5-7 July 2019,ieeexplore

Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem.

10.1109/HPCA.2018.00018,In-Situ AI: Towards Autonomous and Incremental Deep Learning for IoT Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent years have seen an exploration of data volumes from a myriad of IoT devices, such as various sensors and ubiquitous cameras. The deluge of IoT data creates enormous opportunities for us to explore the physical world, especially with the help of deep learning techniques. Traditionally, the Cloud is the option for deploying deep learning based applications. However, the challenges of Cloud-centric IoT systems are increasing due to significant data movement overhead, escalating energy needs, and privacy issues. Rather than constantly moving a tremendous amount of raw data to the Cloud, it would be beneficial to leverage the emerging powerful IoT devices to perform the inference task. Nevertheless, the statically trained model could not efficiently handle the dynamic data in the real in-situ environments, which leads to low accuracy. Moreover, the big raw IoT data challenges the traditional supervised training method in the Cloud. To tackle the above challenges, we propose In-situ AI, the first Autonomous and Incremental computing framework and architecture for deep learning based IoT applications. We equip deep learning based IoT system with autonomous IoT data diagnosis (minimize data movement), and incremental and unsupervised training method (tackle the big raw IoT data generated in ever-changing in-situ environments). To provide efficient architectural support for this new computing paradigm, we first characterize the two In-situ AI tasks (i.e. inference and diagnosis tasks) on two popular IoT devices (i.e. mobile GPU and FPGA) and explore the design space and tradeoffs. Based on the characterization results, we propose two working modes for the In-situ AI tasks, including Single-running and Co-running modes. Moreover, we craft analytical models for these two modes to guide the best configuration selection. We also develop a novel two-level weight shared In-situ AI architecture to efficiently deploy In-situ tasks to IoT node. Compared with traditional IoT systems, our In-situ AI can reduce data movement by 28-71%, which further yields 1.4X-3.3X speedup on model update and contributes to 30-70% energy saving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8327001/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA),24-28 Feb. 2018,ieeexplore

Feature selection is one essential method in such applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability. However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive empirical evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using one synthetic dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover different use cases.

The majority of malignant skin lesions present at a general practice level where a diagnosis is based on a clinical decision algorithm. As a false negative diagnosis is an unacceptable outcome, clinical caution tends to result in a low positive predictive value of as low at 8%. There has been a large burden of surgical excisions that retrospectively prove to have been unnecessary.This paper proposes a method to identify melanomas in dermoscopic images using a convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method implements transfer learning based on the ResNet50 CNN, pretrained using the ImageNet dataset. Datasets from the ISIC Archive were implemented during training, validation and testing. Further tests were performed on a smaller dataset of images taken from the Dermnet NZ website and from recent clinical cases still awaiting histological results to indicate the trained network's ability to generalise to real cases. The 86% test accuracy achieved with the proposed method was comparable to the results of prior studies but required significantly less pre-processing actions to classify a lesion and was not dependant on consistent image scaling or the presence of a scale on the image.

The running status of radars are consecutively recorded in time series to monitor the status of different channels. However, due to the large sum of data, the status data is not rigorously used to diagnose possible radar faults. Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data. Based on the assumption that anomaly deviates from normal data, the time periods with large prediction error can be recognized as faults.

It has also become a necessity to predict the faults that could occur between the different transfer nodes of the enterprise application. The features of preventive maintenance which includes methodical study, estimation, the notion of time, the diagnosis of faults and so on can be analyzed using well designed and structured methods of relevance to the application domain. In this scenario, the technologies which are focused are diagnosis of faults and activities, prediction of the states and monitoring the conditions. There is a large amount of data which is being used for preventive maintenance. The flow of packets between transfer nodes can be stored and this data can be used for purpose of training and testing. Further, machine learning algorithms can be implemented based on the features present in the historical data. The advantage on the study of preventive maintenance is that it can aid in reduction of cost which is the primary motive of each organization existing toady.

10.1109/SMARTCOMP50058.2020.00027,Quantitative Analysis of Deep Leaf: a Plant Disease Detector on the Smart Edge,IEEE,Conferences,"Diagnosis of plant health conditions is gaining significant attention in smart agriculture. Timely recognition of early symptoms of a disease can help avoid the spread of epidemics on the plantations. In this regard, most of the existing solutions use some AI techniques on smart edge devices (IoTs or intelligent Cyber Physical Systems), typically equipped with a hardware like sensors and actuators. However, the resource constraints on such devices like energy (power), memory and computation capability, make the execution of complex operations and AI algorithms (neural network models) for disease detection quite challenging. To this end, compression and quantization techniques offer viable solutions to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks while maximizing performance on the constrained devices. In this paper, we realized a real intelligent CPS on top of which we implemented an AI application, called Deep Leaf running on a microcontroller of the STM32 family, to detect coffee plant diseases with the help of a Quantized Convolutional Neural Network (Q-CNN) model. We present a quantitative analysis of Deep Leaf by comparing five different deep learning models: a 32-bit floating point model, a compressed model, and three different types of quantized models exhibiting differences in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, average inference time, and energy consumption.

Experimental results show the significant dominance of the GP classifier against its competing methods including k-nearest neighbors, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine and ensemble learning AdaBoost.

We present the development and functioning of our lab-developed fNIRS system. It provides a real-time display of variation in blood chromophores related to neuronal activation. It employs 128 dual-wavelength LEDs of 735 nm and 850 nm. The selection of these wavelengths allows computation of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). A single photosensor is used in the presented device.

People with LBP show altered trunk muscle activity and enhanced fatigability of trunk muscles is associated with the development and future risk of LBP. Therefore, a system that can forecast trunk muscle activity and detect fatigue can help subjects, practitioners and physiotherapists in the diagnosis, monitoring and recovery of LBP.

In particular, formulating the respiration monitoring process as a 3D space-time volumetric representation, we introduce a real-time surface reconstruction algorithm to generate omni-direction deformation states of a patient's chest while breathing, which reflects the change in tidal volume over time. These deformation states are then used to estimate breathing volume through a per-patient correlation metric acquired through a Bayesian-network learning process.

The approach focuses on integrating neural networks into a knowledge-based expert system. The system employs evidential reasoning to identify malfunctions by combining evidence originating from equipment maintenance history, on-line sensor data, and in-line past-process measurements. Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component. Predicted failure rates are then converted to belief levels. For on-line diagnosis in the case of previously unencountered faults, a CUSUM control chart is implemented on real sensor data to detect very small process shifts and their trends. For the known fault case, hypothesis resting on the statistical mean and variance of the sensor data is performed to search for similar data patterns and assign belief levels. Finally, neural process models of process figures of merit (such as etch uniformity) derived from prior experimentation are used to analyze the in-line measurements, and identify the most suitable candidate among faulty input parameters (such as gas flow) to explain process shifts.

The CSVM-EC<sup>2</sup>RC algorithm involves two stages: estimating the classification reliability based on trained SVM classifier, and determining the optimal reject rate of positive class and negative class by minimizing the average cost based on the given error cost and class-dependent reject cost.

10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318840,Semi-supervised manifold learning with affinity regularization for Alzheimer's disease identification using positron emission tomography imaging,IEEE,Conferences,"Dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) in particular is a global problem and big threat to the aging population. An image based computer-aided dementia diagnosis method is needed to providing doctors help during medical image examination. Many machine learning based dementia classification methods using medical imaging have been proposed and most of them achieve accurate results. However, most of these methods make use of supervised learning requiring fully labeled image dataset, which usually is not practical in real clinical environment. Using large amount of unlabeled images can improve the dementia classification performance. In this study we propose a new semi-supervised dementia classification method based on random manifold learning with affinity regularization. Three groups of spatial features are extracted from positron emission tomography (PET) images to construct an unsupervised random forest which is then used to regularize the manifold learning objective function. The proposed method, stat-of-the-art Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM) and supervised SVM are applied to classify AD and normal controls (NC). The experiment results show that learning with unlabeled images indeed improves the classification performance. And our method outperforms LapSVM on the same dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7318840/,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),25-29 Aug. 2015,ieeexplore
10.1109/INDIANCC.2016.7441102,Sensor health monitoring using simple data driven approaches,IEEE,Conferences,"Present day high end vehicles contain as many as 100 microprocessors and have more than 100 million lines of code [3]. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7441102/,2016 Indian Control Conference (ICC),4-6 Jan. 2016,ieeexplore

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis (unhealthy individuals).

This paper proposes a new statistical method combined with a simple classification algorithm that can discriminate epileptic EEG signals from normal signals. The statistical method extracts most significant spectral features by maximizing statistical distance between the epileptic and the normal power spectrums. The power spectrum density of EEG signals is estimated by the multi-taper method. A linear algorithm based on the Fisher discriminant analysis classifies the selected spectral features as either the epileptic or the normal class from the EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that our method could reach &gt;99.6% classification accuracy while its computational complexity appears to be much lower than the previously proposed methods that exhibited similar classification performances.

Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system.

Doctors screen for sarcopenia by observing patients’ habitual gait features without quantification and the performance of gait disturbances differ in various people that are considered to be sarcopenic, which is an important basis along with reduced physical functioning for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Such a subjective diagnosis has been seen as a problem because diagnostic results may differ among doctors and factors such as fatigue may affect diagnosis.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092364,Towards real-time implementation of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) — How to Identify optimum acoustic output for SHAPE?,IEEE,Conferences,"Pressure measurements within the chambers of the heart yield critical information for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients (~92 million Americans), but the procedure used to gain these pressures, cardiac catheterization, is invasive and expensive. Subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) may be able to estimate intra-cardiac pressures noninvasively, if the optimum incident acoustic output (IAO) for SHAPE can be established in real-time. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine in real-time the optimum IAO for SHAPE. We developed a customized interface on a SonixTablet scanner (BK Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) using C/C++ and Qt libraries (The Qt Company, Oslo, Norway). In vitro experiments were conducted using a closed-loop flow system. Activated Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, N. Billerica, MA, USA; 0.1 ml) was mixed with 750 ml isotonic diluent. A pressure catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was used to acquire ambient pressure values. A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (f<sub>transmit</sub>: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727769,Training cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks on imbalance data problems,IEEE,Conferences,"Many real-world problems are usually unbalanced, where datasets present skewed class distributions, such as failure diagnosis, spam detection, anomaly detection, fraud detection, oil spillage detection and medical diagnosis, etc. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a competitive machine learning technique with good performance in many applications. However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets. An evolutionary algorithm is also implemented to optimize the misclassification costs for each class in cost matrix.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7727769/,2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),24-29 July 2016,ieeexplore

In many industry scenarios, collected labeled sample signals are usually not in the same data distribution. A major assumption for traditional learning and deep learning based bearing fault diagnosis methods is the training data and testing data must follow the same data distribution. However, this assumption may not hold in reality. To address the different distribution problem, this paper proposed an unsupervised approach for bearing fault diagnosis based on transfer learning. The correlation alignment (CORAL) algorithm is used to align data distribution of domains in the proposed approach, then the proposed approach applies statistical algorithms to extract shallow features and wavelet scattering network to extract deep features. The 1 nearest neighbors (1-NN) classifier is trained with the feature vector matrix of source domain, which is able to classify the unlabeled samples of target domain presenting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2832648,A Cost-Sensitive Deep Belief Network for Imbalanced Classification,IEEE,Journals,"Imbalanced data with a skewed class distribution are common in many real-world applications. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning technique that is effective in classification tasks. However, conventional DBN does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes equal costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches assign different misclassification costs for different classes without disrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive learning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential evolution to optimize the misclassification costs based on the training data that presents an effective approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e., G-mean) into the objective function. We first optimize the misclassification costs, and then apply them to DBN. Adaptive differential evolution optimization is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates its corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge.

Notably, the noise in the signal will interfere with the diagnosis process of the signal and reduce the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Based on the above problem, adaptive filtering (AF) is used as an excellent method to attenuate noise without specifying the noise type. However, how to define the most appropriate length and type of morphological filter element is the most inherent problem which needs to be solved first. This paper proposed a cooperative diagnosis method of rolling bearings vibration signal based on improved adaptive filtering and joint distribution adaptation (JDA). First, the kurtosis under different element types and lengths is calculated as an index. The structural element corresponding to maximum kurtosis is selected as the most suitable morphological filter element because the different morphological filter elements reflect the effect of feature extraction. Then, JDA aims to improve both the marginal distribution and the conditional distribution to solve the chaotic distribution of time-domain features under variable working conditions. Finally, the improved least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) verified the effectiveness and improvement of the proposed method under bearing acceleration signal.

10.1109/TIM.2021.3088489,A Hybrid Generalization Network for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Under Unseen Working Conditions,IEEE,Journals,"The data-driven methods in machinery fault diagnosis have become increasingly popular in the past two decades. However, the wide applications of this scheme are generally compromised in real-world conditions because of the discrepancy between the training data and testing data. Although the recently emerging transfer fault diagnosis can learn transferable features from relevant source data and adapt the diagnostic model to the target data, these methods still only work on the target domain with a priori data distribution. The generalization capability of the transferred model cannot be guaranteed for unseen domains. Since the working conditions of machinery are varying during operation, the generalization capability of the diagnosis methods is crucial in this case. To tackle this challenge, this article proposes a domain generalization-based hybrid diagnosis network for deploying to unseen working conditions. The main idea is to regularize the discriminant structure of the deep network with both intrinsic and extrinsic generalization objectives such that the diagnostic model can learn robust features and generalize to unseen domains. The triplet loss minimization of intrinsic multisource data is implemented to facilitate the intraclass compactness and the interclass separability at the class level, leading to a more generalized decision boundary. The extrinsic domain-level regularization is achieved by using adversarial training to further reduce the risk of overfitting.

Different intelligent application scenarios can benefit from these computer-based systems that predict the ages of people correctly. Automatic apparent age system is particularly useful in medical diagnosis, facial beauty product development, movie role casting, the effect of plastic surgery, and anti-aging treatment. Predicting the real and apparent age of people has been quite difficult for both machines and humans. More recently, Deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods have been extensively used for these classification task. It has incomparable advantages in extracting discriminative image features from human faces. However, many of the existing CNN-based methods are designed to be deeper and larger with more complex layers that makes it challenging to deploy on mobile devices with resource-constrained features. Therefore, we design a lightweight CNN model of fewer layers to estimate the real and apparent age of individuals from unconstrained real-time face images that can be deployed on mobile devices.

In some cases, the rotating machinery has long rotor, it need to arrange multiple sensors at different positions of the system and different faults are located at different positions of the system. The primary difficult issue involved in the task is to recognize the multiple faults at different positions of ball screw with high accuracy and feasibility. In order to overcome the problem, a novel method for ball screw fault diagnosis is proposed. The proposed method combines weighted data of the multiple sensors at different positions with convolutional neural network and it considers the sensitive index of different faults at different sensors for weight assignment. The proposed method mainly contains three steps. Firstly, a new data segmentation algorithm is proposed to obtain the uniform data of the vibration signals.

In this context, it is of paramount importance to identify such conflicts before sending network service (NS) request (NS-Req) to the embedding algorithm to avoid unexpected behavior in its execution. Since both NS-Req and NFV infrastructure (NFVI) may contain many policies, the process of conflict detection and diagnosis is an intricate work both for humans and computer systems. Besides, as conflicts may occur among a set of constraints, pairwise detection will not suffice. Therefore, this paper proposes NSChecker, a semantic verification system to detect and diagnose policy conflicts in NFV environments. To achieve its functionality, NSChecker uses an ontology, called Onto-NFV, to describe the NFVI, NS, and associated policies. With Onto-NFV, conflicts detection is carried out through description logic (DL) inconsistency verification. We develop a prototype of NSChecker in Java and validate its capabilities on a small scenario with three use cases, showing that it supports conflict detection concerning the following policies: network function precedence, resource usage, and location.

Analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has attracted wide attention for identifying fatigue driving. With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), we hope to establish an EEG-based IoV traffic management system to improve traffic safety. In the proposed system, real-time diagnosis is a significant factor, and improvement of the detection speed is our main concern. EEG signals generate a large amount of spatially oriented data over a relatively short duration; hence, their dimension needs to be reduced effectively before being analysed. We proposes a feature reduction method, based on a novel weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) algorithm for EEG signals. First, the EEG features are extracted by an autoregressive (AR) model. Second, we calculate the influence of different features on the classified performance of fatigue state. The accuracy reduction values of different features are normalised as the weights of the features. Finally, these weights are assigned to the WPCA to reduce the EEG features. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we carried out a simulated driving experiment involving eight participants. For comparison, power spectral density and differential entropy models were also introduced to extract EEG features. Support Vector Machine was adopted as a classifier to establish a fatigue driving classification experiment. The experimental results show that the WPCA method can effectively reduce the feature dimension of different EEG feature extraction methods, speed up calculations, and achieve a much higher classification accuracy of fatigue driving.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8815722/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima.

It can convert the innumerable raw day-to-day medical big data from massive IoT-based medical devices to diagnostic valuable data so that they can be feed to clinical routine. In this article, we propose a novel spatiotemporal two-streams generative adversarial network (SpGAN) as a cross-modality data processing approach to deploy the medical IoT in infarction learning. Our SpGAN remotely converts diagnostic valuable contrast-enhanced images (the “gold standard” for infarction learning, but it requires the injection of contrast agents) directly from raw nonenhanced cine MR images. This converting allows physicians to remotely perform infarction observation and analysis to break through the limitations of time and space by building a cloud computing platform of IoT-based MRI devices. Importantly, this converting offers a low-risk IoT-based manner to eliminate the potential fatal risk caused by contrast agent injection in the current infarction learning workflow. Specifically, SpGAN consists of: 1) a spatiotemporal two-stream framework as an encoding–decoding model to achieve data converting and 2) a spatiotemporal pyramid network enhances those features that are responsible to the infarction learning during encoding to improve decoding performance. Real IoT-based remote diagnosis experiments performed on 230 patients demonstrate that SpGAN provides high-quality converted images for infarction learning and promotes the in-depth application and deployment of IoT in the medical field.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386256/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971319,Artificial Generation of Partial Discharge Sources Through an Algorithm Based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks,IEEE,Journals,"The measurement of partial discharges (PD) in electrical equipment or machines subjected to high voltage can be considered as one of the most important indicators when assessing the state of an insulation system. One of the main challenges in monitoring these degradation phenomena is to adequately measure a statistically significant number of signals from each of the sources acting on the asset under test. However, in industrial environments the presence of large amplitude noise sources or the simultaneous presence of multiple PD sources may limit the acquisition of the signals and therefore the final diagnosis of the equipment status may not be the most accurate. Although different procedures and separation and identification techniques have been implemented with very good results, not having a significant number of PD pulses associated with each source can limit the effectiveness of these procedures. Based on the above, this research proposes a new algorithm of artificial generation of PD based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) architecture which allows artificially generating different sources of PD from a small group of real PD, in order to complement those sources that during the measurement were poorly represented in terms of signals. According to the results obtained in different experiments, the temporal and spectral behavior of artificially generated PD sources proved to be similar to that of real experimentally obtained sources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979409/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TASE.2004.840071,Artificial-intelligence approach for biomedical sample characterization using Raman spectroscopy,IEEE,Journals,"An artificial-intelligence approach is proposed to differentiate various biomedical samples via Raman spectroscopy technology to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision making. The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components. Eventually, various principal components are accumulated for clustering using scatter plots. The long-term objective of this intelligent-control approach is to create a real-time technique for sample analysis, using a Raman spectrometer directly mounted at the end-effectors of medical robots, which is to enhance the robotic surgery.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1381368/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,Jan. 2005,ieeexplore

However, since EEG signals are highly complex, nonlinear and nonstationary in nature, both visual inspection and the existing computed aid detection approaches fail to capture the intrinsic dynamics of seizure events, leading to unsatisfactory detection performance. Therefore, an accurate computer-aided automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis system is valuable and urgently needed in clinical application. In this study, we propose an automatic classification method using nonlinear dynamics features and nonlinear classifiers for determining whether the EEG signals are in interictal or ictal activities, respectively. The main novelty of this paper is that investigating the performance of discernable entropy-based nonlinear dynamics features used for automatic diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. First, the discrete wavelet transform is applied to obtain de-noised and sub-band signals. Second, the nonlinear dynamics features are extracted based on information entropy theory. Subsequently, one-way analysis of variance and forward sequential feature selection technique are employed to identify the most explainable features for seizure detection. Then the selected features are fed to six different classifiers, namely, least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes classifier, and random forest, for automatic diagnosis of the epileptic seizure. Finally, a public EEG dataset from Bonn University, Germany, is utilized to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the LS-SVM yields the optimal performance with an accuracy of 99.50%, a sensitivity of 100.00%, and a specificity of 99.40%.

Remarkable research is being carried out to propose robust automatic diagnostic tools for the detection of pathologies from the chest radiographs. Artificial Intelligence techniques have been found to give promising results in automating the field of medicine. Lot of research has been done for automatic detection of pneumothorax from chest radiographs while proposing several frameworks based on artificial intelligence techniques. Undoubtedly, several models are available for automatic diagnosis of pneumothorax, however a summarized review of the existing literature is still missing. This study summarizes the existing literature for pneumothorax detection from chest x-rays along with describing the available chest radiographs datasets. It will help the researchers to select the optimal and most effective model with respect to the real-time scenarios. The comparative analysis of the literature is provided in terms of goodness, usability, and quality along with highlighting the research gaps for further investigation. From the literature, it is evident that pneumothorax is more common in men as compared to women. Additionally, the proposed models have achieved incredible results for pneumothorax detection on selected datasets, however, the effectiveness of proposed models in real-time cases cannot be claimed, as none of the models have been implemented clinically yet. This issue can be solved by external validation of the models. Furthermore, the class-imbalance problem in most of the medical image dataset has been solved by algorithm-level-techniques. Moreover, there is need to put more effort in combined detection and localization of pneumothorax as mostly research is limited to either classification or localization of pathology. So far, best results have been achieved by deep-learning based models with Area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) of 88.87% for classification, and Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of 88.21% for localization of pneumothorax.

The aim of this paper is to reduce user variability in data acquisition by automatically computing a score of echo quality for operator feedback. To do this, a deep convolutional neural network model, trained on a large set of samples, was developed for scoring apical four-chamber (A4C) echo. In this paper, 6,916 end-systolic echo images were manually studied by an expert cardiologist and were assigned a score between 0 (not acceptable) and 5 (excellent). The images were divided into two independent training-validation and test sets. The network architecture and its parameters were based on the stochastic approach of the particle swarm optimization on the training-validation data. The mean absolute error between the scores from the ultimately trained model and the expert's manual scores was 0.71 ± 0.58. The reported error was comparable to the measured intra-rater reliability. The learned features of the network were visually interpretable and could be mapped to the anatomy of the heart in the A4C echo, giving confidence in the training result. The computation time for the proposed network architecture, running on a graphics processing unit, was less than 10 ms per frame, sufficient for real-time deployment. The proposed approach has the potential to facilitate the widespread use of echo at the point-of-care and enable early and timely diagnosis and treatment.

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers—both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios—and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$&gt;$</tex-math></inline-formula> 97% F-score.

In this article, we address this challenge by introducing a novel system to recognize symptoms of cognitive decline by exploiting modern smart-home sensors. Since several studies indicate that cognitive issues are frequently associated to locomotion anomalies, our work relies on clinical models of wandering behavior. Previous works tried to recognize wandering of elderly people in outdoor environments, using GPS data and location trace analysis. However, the recognition of wandering indoors poses additional challenges. On the one hand, when moving in a restricted indoor environment, a system for wandering recognition may produce a large number of false positive, since a person's movements are frequently more intricate indoors than outdoors. On the other hand, several indoor movements resembling wandering may be actually due to the normal execution of daily living activities, or to the particular shape of the home. To address these challenges, we adopt a collaborative learning approach, using a training set of trajectories shared by individuals living in smart-homes. New wandering episodes are classified using a personalized model, built considering the homes’ shape and the individuals’ profiles. We apply a long-term analysis of classified wandering episodes to provide a hypothesis of diagnosis to be communicated to a medical center for further inspection.

However, in engineering practice, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sample data to train the intelligent diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a fusion diagnosis model CGAN-2-D-CNN that combines a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis with small samples. Considering the problem of insufficient sample data, CGAN is used to learn the data distribution of real samples to generate new samples with similar data distribution by the confrontation training of the generator and discriminator.

Machine learning-based methods are increasingly being used for fault diagnosis applications. However, the performance of such detection algorithms will degrade because of variations between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation of the field. Furthermore, the fault's data in the target domain for model training are usually not available. In this paper, domain adaptation combined with deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DA-DCGAN)-based methodology is proposed, where DA-DCGAN first learns an intelligent normal-to-arcing transformation from the source-domain data. Then by generating dummy arcing data with the learned transformation using the normal data from the target domain and employing domain adaptation, a robust and reliable fault diagnosis scheme can be achieved for the target domain. The PV loop current is framed and arranged into a 2D matrix as input for cross-domain DC series arc fault diagnosis. The system is validated offline using pre-recorded PV loop current data from a real 1.5-kW grid-connected rooftop PV system. Also, the proposed method is implemented in an embedded system and tested in real-time according to UL-1699B standard.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986356,Data Fusion Generative Adversarial Network for Multi-Class Imbalanced Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery,IEEE,Journals,"For the fault diagnosis problems of rotating machinery in the real industrial practice, measurement data with imbalanced class distributions negatively affect the diagnostic performance of most conventional machine learning classification algorithms since equal cost weights are assigned to different fault classes. Meanwhile, the widely used traditional data generation methods for the imbalanced data problem are limited by data dependencies over time continuity. To fill this research gap, this paper develops a new diagnostic framework based on the adversarial neural networks (GAN) and multi-sensor data fusion technique to generate new synthetic data for data compensation purpose. Two different practice modes are designed based on this framework according to the position logic of the data fusion, namely a Pre-fusion GAN mode and a Post-fusion GAN mode. More concretely, without data pre-processing, the designed generator generates synthetic data to puzzle the discriminator and the synthetic data that out-trick the discriminator can be used to compensate the minor class. To avoid data dependency and to ensure the generality of the proposed framework, the network modelling are trained with a more practical approach where the training and test data are obtained under different rotating speeds.

Although the use of data-driven fault detection techniques have gained much interest, the main deterrent in using these approaches in detecting ITSC faults is in the generalization and robustness of the diagnosis. In this paper, a data-driven on-line fault detection framework, incorporated with multi-feature extraction/selection and multi-classifier ensemble is proposed, capable of detecting ITSC faults in induction motors (IMs) that subjected to variable operating conditions. By using the synchronous time series signals collected from the machines, multiple feature extraction/selection is explored to find the sensitive faulty features, and the different types of classification strategies is used to increase the diversity of single based models. With the increased diversity of the base learners, the fault detection accuracy is expected to be enhanced and the robustness can be guaranteed.

Since machine health monitoring itself belongs to high stake decision applications, the outputs of the autonomous monitoring systems should be trustworthy and reliable, which refers to obtain explainability. Then, it comes to the following key question: why the deployed MHMS predicts what they predict. In this article, we shed some light on this meaningful research direction: explainable MHMSs (EMHMS). In EMHMS, the machine doctor could act like a real doctor who can not only make a diagnosis but also describe the patient's symptoms. First, we propose a specific convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, named DecouplEd Feature-Temporal CNN (DEFT-CNN), to balance precision-explainability tradeoff. Specifically, feature information and temporal information have been encoded in different stages of our model. The spatial attention module is added to boost the performance of the model.

In addition, there is a huge increase in the amount of monitoring data of equipment. There is urgent need for handling this massive data, obtaining highly discriminative features, and further producing accurate diagnosis results in the field of fault diagnosis. Aimed at these problems, a deep residual network based on multi-task learning is proposed, taking detection of fault location and judgment of fault severity into account simultaneously. This network is fed with two kinds of diagnostic information, which is helpful to mine the potential links between two tasks of fault diagnosis and generate very representative features.

10.1109/TADVP.2004.828824,Intelligent SOP manufacturing,IEEE,Journals,"Microsystems packaging is fundamentally dependent on the manufacture of microelectronic, photonic, radio frequency (RF), and MEMS devices. The system-on-package (SOP) approach has been identified as a key strategy for integrating these strategic packaging technologies. Because of rising costs, the challenge before SOP manufacturers is to offset capital investment with greater automation and technological innovation in the fabrication process. To reduce manufacturing cost, several important subtasks have emerged, including increasing fabrication yield, reducing product cycle time, maintaining consistent levels of product quality and performance, and improving the reliability of processing equipment. Because of the large number of steps involved, maintaining product quality in an SOP manufacturing facility requires the control of hundreds of process variables. The interdependent issues of high yield, high quality, and low cycle time are addressed by the ongoing development of several critical capabilities in state-of-the-art computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) systems: in situ process monitoring, process/equipment modeling, real-time process control, and equipment diagnosis. Recently, the use of computational intelligence in various manufacturing applications has increased, and the SOP manufacturing arena is no exception to this trend. Artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs), and other techniques have emerged as powerful tools for assisting CIM systems in performing various process monitoring, modeling, and control functions.

However, in many cases the collected data may be incomplete or inconsistent, while the underlying environment may be time-varying or unformulated. In this paper, we develop an innovative cognitive fault diagnosis framework that tackles the above challenges. This framework investigates fault diagnosis in the model space instead of the signal space. Learning in the model space is implemented by fitting a series of models using a series of signal segments selected with a sliding window. By investigating the learning techniques in the fitted model space, faulty models can be discriminated from healthy models using a one-class learning algorithm. The framework enables us to construct a fault library when unknown faults occur, which can be regarded as cognitive fault isolation.

Different from native real-valued negative selection algorithm (RNSA) that operates in original data space, this algorithm utilizes feature space transformation and diversity factor-based GA for optimized detector distribution in nonself feature space. The proposed framework comprises three stages namely; feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection, and GA optimized AIS. In the first stage, signal processing methods are applied to extract multidomain features (time-domain statistical, frequency domain statistical, and special features) of the system. In the second stage, two unsupervised methods namely, k-NN clustering and pretraining using deep learning neural network are proposed for dominant fault-characterizing feature selection. Finally, in the third stage, the fault-characterizing feature vectors are used for system status categorization (i.e., normal, fault) using selected (fault-characterizing) features-based AIS method. The efficacy of the proposed framework is verified through experiments on motor bearing fault detection using vibration signal. The major accomplishment of the proposed combination of space transformation, feature selection and AIS (anomaly classification) techniques is the alleviation of computational burden on RNSA implementation.

However, many of existing DL methods fail in relationship mining between signals explicitly. Unlike those deep neural networks, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) taking graph data with topological structure as input is more efficient for data relationship mining, making GCN to be powerful for feature representation from graph data in non-Euclidean space. Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation. To address these issues, a multireceptive field graph convolutional network (MRF-GCN) is proposed for effective intelligent fault diagnosis. In MRF-GCN, data samples are converted into weighted graphs to indicate differences in relationship of data samples. Moreover, MRF-GCN learns not only features from different receptive field, but also fuses learned features as an enhanced feature representation.

CM can be performed via an array of sensors providing multiple, real-time equipment degradation information with broad coverage. However, loss of sensor readings due to sensor abnormalities and/or malfunction of connectors has long been a hurdle to reliable fault diagnosis and prognosis in multichannel CM systems. The problem becomes more challenging when the sensor channels are not synchronized because of different sampling rates used and/or time-varying operational schemes. This paper provides a nonparametric sensor recovery technique and a semi-parametric alternative to enhance the robustness of multichannel CM systems. Based on historical data, models for all the sensor signals are constructed using functional principal component analysis (FPCA), and functional regression (FR) models are developed for those correlated signals. These models with parameters updated in online implementation can be used to recover the lost sensor signals.

Generally, the training of models requires large, representative datasets, which may be collected from a large number of users and contain sensitive information (e.g., users' photos and medical information). The collected data would be stored and computed by service providers (SPs) or delegated to an untrusted cloud. The users can neither control how it will be used, nor realize what will be learned from it, which make the privacy issues prominent and severe. To solve the privacy issues, one of the most popular approaches is to encrypt users' data with their public keys. However, this technique inevitably leads to another challenge that how to train the model based on multi-key encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving deep learning model, namely PDLM, to apply deep learning over the encrypted data under multiple keys. In PDLM, lots of users contribute their encrypted data to SP to learn a specific model. We adopt an effective privacy-preserving calculation toolkit to achieve the training process based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in a privacy-preserving manner.

However, the network generated by KAF keeps growing with the accumulation of the training samples, which leads to the increasing memory requirement and computational burden. To address this issue, a pruning approach that attempts to restrict the network size to a fixed value is incorporated into a kernel recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm, yielding a novel KAF algorithm called parsimonious KRLS (PKRLS). The basic idea of the pruning technique is to remove the center with the least importance from the existing dictionary. The importance of a center is quantified by its contribution to minimizing the cost function. The calculation of the importance measure is formulated in an efficient manner, which facilitates its implementation in online settings.

However, human diagnosis is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional.

Neural networks are used in the maintenance phase of diagnosis to approximate the functional form of the failure history distribution of each component.

Potentially, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis could form a basis for the objective evaluation of intelligent medical systems. However, it has several weaknesses when applied to the types of data used to evaluate intelligent medical systems. First, small data sets are often used, which are unsatisfactory with existing methods. Second, many existing ROC methods use parametric assumptions which may not always be valid for the test cases selected. Third, system evaluations are often more concerned with particular, clinically meaningful, points on the curve, rather than on global indexes such as the more commonly used area under the curve. A novel, robust and accurate method is proposed, derived from first principles, which calculates the probability density function (pdf) for each point on a ROC curve for any given sample size. Confidence intervals are produced as contours on the pdf. The theoretical work has been validated by Monte Carlo simulations. It has also been applied to two real-world examples of ROC analysis, taken from the literature (classification of mammograms and differential diagnosis of pancreatic diseases), to investigate the confidence surfaces produced for real cases, and to illustrate how analysis of system performance can be enhanced. The authors illustrate the impact of sample size on system performance from analysis of ROC pdf's and 95% confidence boundaries. This work establishes an important new method for generating pdf's, and provides an accurate and robust method of producing confidence intervals for ROC curves for the small sample sizes typical of intelligent medical systems.

Numerical results show that the proposed Fourier series method coincides with that of Fast Fourier Transform. Experimental results and the comparison with previous methods show high efficiency and merits of its application to transistor open-circuit fault location in the voltage-source inverter.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9084098/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TBME.2013.2243447,Simultaneously Identifying All True Vessels From Segmented Retinal Images,IEEE,Journals,"Measurements of retinal blood vessel morphology have been shown to be related to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The wrong identification of vessels may result in a large variation of these measurements, leading to a wrong clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we address the problem of automatically identifying true vessels as a postprocessing step to vascular structure segmentation. We model the segmented vascular structure as a vessel segment graph and formulate the problem of identifying vessels as one of finding the optimal forest in the graph given a set of constraints. We design a method to solve this optimization problem and evaluate it on a large real-world dataset of 2446 retinal images. Experiment results are analyzed with respect to actual measurements of vessel morphology. The results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve 98.9% pixel precision and 98.7% recall of the true vessels for clean segmented retinal images, and remains robust even when the segmented image is noisy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6423262/,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,July 2013,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIM.2020.2987654,Smartphone-Based Point-of-Care System Using Continuous-Wave Portable Doppler,IEEE,Journals,"Point-of-care Ultrasound (PoCUS) is a safe, repeatable, and inexpensive bedside diagnostic tool. Over the years, PoCUS services are adopted in resource-limited settings for faster and useful outcomes. For a cost-effective and power-efficient solution, a smartphone-based portable continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound (US) system has been developed for diagnosing peripheral arterial diseases based on the hemodynamic feature values. The proposed system includes the analog front end (AFE), signal processing and display unit (SPDU), and smartphone application. The AFE acquires blood flow signal from the brachial artery using an 8-MHz pencil probe, extracts the Doppler shift frequency, and transfers to the SPDU through 12-bit analog-to-digital converter. To provide an area and power-efficient solution, SPDU is embedded in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based single chip. A COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC)-based custom-designed 512-point fast Fourier transform is implemented in that FPGA for displaying the blood flow spectrogram in real time. For back-end processing, the smartphone application receives a spectrogram through Bluetooth, removes noise, extracts hemodynamic features, and diagnoses using a machine learning framework. The device has been examined on 18 volunteers (normal: 17 and abnormal: 1), while the accuracy is found to be 94% in the pretrained support vector machine classifier. For validation, the spectrogram of the normal and abnormal subjects and parameter values are compared with the commercial device. Overall, the handheld device is minimally trained operator-dependent and consumes &lt;; 4 W of power for real-time processing. Such smartphone-based feature extraction and automated diagnosis can facilitate the point-of-care system and provide a baseline for early assessment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9064842/,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/JSEN.2019.2921862,Speed of Sound-Based Capnographic Sensor With Second-Generation CNN for Automated Classification of Cardiorespiratory Abnormalities,IEEE,Journals,"The measurement of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration in exhaled air can be used as a diagnostic tool for many pulmonary and respiratory diseases. Capnography, the waveform that tracks the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in exhaled air, reflects the physiological and anatomical conditions of the human body. In this paper, we propose a novel speed of sound-based capnographic sensing mechanism for measuring the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the exhaled air. The sensor response is further classified using our proposed second-generation convolutional neural network with SVM architecture. Automated quantitative analysis to differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), between healthy and congestive heart failure (CHF), and between COPD and CHF has been implemented. The classification was performed on both the signal acquired using the developed hardware and the signal from the capnobase dataset. Furthermore, the experimental results were clinically validated. The proposed method yields an accuracy of 95.16%, 87.55%, and 90.19% for COPD/Healthy, CHF/Healthy, and COPD/CHF classifications, respectively. The development of a non-invasive, low cost, and small size sensor for capnography can extend the use of capnography from intubated patients to pre-hospital applications. Lower computation time and better accuracy achieved depict the effectiveness of the proposed method to be used in real-time diagnosis of cardiorespiratory diseases.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8733864/,IEEE Sensors Journal,"1 Oct.1, 2019",ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095391,Studying the Applicability of Generative Adversarial Networks on HEp-2 Cell Image Augmentation,IEEE,Journals,"The Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANAs) testing is the primary serological diagnosis screening test for autoimmune diseases. ANAs testing is conducted mainly by the Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) on Human Epithelial cell-substrate (HEp-2) protocol. However, due to its high variability, human-subjectivity, and low throughput, there is an insistent need to develop an efficient Computer-Aided Diagnosis system (CADs) to automate this protocol. Many recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrated promising results in HEp-2 cell image classification, which is the main task of the HE-p2 IIF protocol. However, the lack of large labeled datasets is still the main challenge in this field. This work provides a detailed study of the applicability of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) algorithms as an augmentation method. Different types of GANs were employed to synthesize HEp-2 cell images to address the data scarcity problem. For systematic comparison, empirical quantitative metrics were implemented to evaluate different GAN models' performance of learning the real data representations. The results of this work showed that though the high visual similarity with the real images, GANs' capacity to generate diverse data is still limited. This deficiency in the generated data diversity is found to be of a crucial impact when used as a standalone method for augmentation. However, combining limited-size GANs-generated data with classic augmentation improves the classification accuracy across different variants of CNNs. Our results demonstrated a competitive performance for the overall classification accuracy and the mean class accuracy of the HEp-2 cell image classification task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9475986/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2963939,Towards Real-Time Computing of Intraoperative Hyperspectral Imaging for Brain Cancer Detection Using Multi-GPU Platforms,IEEE,Journals,"Several causes make brain cancer identification a challenging task for neurosurgeons during the surgical procedure. The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949497/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
