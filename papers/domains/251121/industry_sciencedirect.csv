At the same time, the real manufacturing system is prone to various disturbance events, which increase the complexity and uncertainty of shop floor. To this end, this paper addresses the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem with insufficient transportation resources (DFJSP-ITR) to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption. As a sequential decision-making problem, DFJSP-ITR can be modeled as a Markov decision process where the agent should determine the scheduling object and allocation of resources at each decision point. So this paper adopts deep reinforcement learning to solve DFJSP-ITR. In this paper, the multiobjective optimization model of DFJSP-ITR is established. Then, in order to make agent learn to choose the appropriate rule based on the production state at each decision point, a hybrid deep Q network (HDQN) is developed for this problem, which combines deep Q network with three extensions. Moreover, the shop floor state model is established at first, and then the decision point, generic state features, genetic-programming-based action space and reward function are designed. Based on these contents, the training method using HDQN and the strategy for facing new job insertions and machine breakdowns are proposed. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted, and the results show that HDQN has superiority and generality compared with current optimization-based approaches, and can effectively deal with disturbance events and unseen situations through learning.",industry

In this paper, we solve the seam tracking issue using a six-axis welding robot, a line laser sensor and an industrial computer. The processing of welding images is the core of the seam tracking system, which aims to determine the weld feature point in each image. We propose a two-stage weld feature point localization method that combines convolution filter and deep reinforcement learning (CF-DRL) to localize the weld feature point in each welding image robustly and accurately. In the first stage, the weld feature point is roughly tracked using a convolution filter tracker. But the position given by the convolution tracker is sometimes not accurate enough due to the natural gap between visual tracking and seam tracking. Consequently, in the second stage, the weld feature point should be further refined using our trained policy network. Using our two-stage weld feature point localization method, the weld feature points can be determined from noisy images in real time during the welding process. The 3D coordinate values of these points are obtained according to the structured light measurement principle to control the movement of the robot and the torch in real time. A robotic seam tracking system is established based on the equipment and methods mentioned above. Experimental results show that the welding torch runs smoothly with a strong arc light and splash interference. The mean tracking error of our experiments reaches 0.189Â mm, which can fulfill actual welding requirements. Several comparison tests have been performed to illustrate the robustness and accuracy of our seam tracking system using our welding image dataset.",industry

Thus, the new industrial paradigm of Industry 4.0 has gained interest worldwide, leading many manufacturers to a significant digital transformation. Digital technologies have enabled a novel approach to decision-making processes based on data-driven strategies, where knowledge extraction relies on the analysis of a large amount of data from sensor-equipped factories. In this context, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) based on Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent data-driven analytical approaches for monitoring industrial systems aiming to maximise reliability and efficiency. In fact, PdM aims not only to reduce equipment failure rates but also to minimise operating costs by maximising equipment life. When considering industrial applications, industries deal with different issues and constraints relating to process digitalisation. The main purpose of this study is to develop a new decision support system based on decision trees (DTs) that guides the decision-making process of PdM implementation, considering context-aware information, quality and maturity of collected data, severity, occurrence and detectability of potential failures (identified through FMECA analysis) and direct and indirect maintenance costs. The decision trees allow the study of different scenarios to identify the conditions under which a PdM policy, based on the ML algorithm, is economically profitable compared to corrective maintenance, considered to be the current scenario. The results show that the proposed methodology is a simple and easy way to implement tool to support the decision process by assessing the different levels of occurrence and severity of failures. For each level, savings and the potential costs have been evaluated at leaf nodes of the trees aimed at defining the most suitable maintenance strategy implementation. Finally, the proposed DTs are applied to a real industrial case to illustrate their applicability and robustness.",industry

The advantages range from ease of installation and maintenance to reduced deployment time and infrastructure costs. However, industrial automation has critical requirements regarding network infrastructure, such as reliability and failure tolerance. Therefore, it is imperative to have an adequate placement of sensor and router nodes, to obtain a network with multiple paths, allowing the data to reach management systems within a reasonable time, even in the event of failures. The placement of router nodes has to consider latency, network lifespan, connectivity, and failure tolerance aspects in a possibly hostile environment, with classified areas and obstacles such as silos, tanks and buildings. We present a new approach, called POSIMNET-R, to place IWSN routing nodes in an industrial configuration, which circumvents forbidden areas and obstacles, based on Artificial Immunological Networks. The resulting network offers low failure rates and path redundancy criteria. The results have shown that POSIMNET-R was capable of providing a reliable network with multiple paths and resilience of the used routers equal to 81.50% in the basic case study and 73.66% in the real case scenario.",industry

Although traditional automated defect detection applications have shown good performance, these methods are usually configured with handcrafted features designed by a human operator. Recently, deep learning methods that include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance in a wide variety of computer-vision applications. To take advantage of the CNNâs feature representation, the direct utilization of feature maps from the convolutional layers as universal feature descriptors has been studied. In this paper, we propose a sewing defect detection method using a CNN feature map extracted from the initial layers of a pre-trained VGG-16 to detect a broken stitch from a captured image of a sewing operation. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on a set of sewing images, including normal images, their synthetic defects, and rotated images. As a result, the proposed method detected true defects with 92.3% accuracy. Moreover, additional conditions for computing devices and deep learning libraries were investigated to reduce the computing time required for real-time computation. Using a general and cheap single-board computer with resizing the image and utilizing a lightweight deep learning library, the computing time was 0.22Â s. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed methodâs performance as an appropriate manufacturing technology for garment production.",industry

Some of the learning-based feature recognition methods produce less favourable results when recognising highly interacting features, while some require a significant amount of 3D models for training, which present an increasing challenge in a real world scenario, especially whenever collecting large training data becomes too difficult and time-consuming. To this end, effective highly interacting feature recognition via small sample learning becomes bottleneck for learning-based methods. To tackle the above issue, the paper proposes a novel method named RDetNet based on single-shot refinement object detection network (RefineDet) which is capable of recognising highly interacting features with small training samples. In addition, the paper further utilises several data augmentation (DA) strategies to increase the amount of relevant 3D training models. Experiments carried out in this paper show that the proposed method yields favourable results in recognising highly interacting features by using small training samples (e.g. 32 models per class).",industry

One major reason for this robustness problem is a lack of adequate training data, especially faulty data, measured in various operating conditions. To cover this gap, we propose a novel data augmentation framework for robustness enhancement in railway MFD applications. First, multibody dynamic simulation (MBS) for physical modeling is applied to simulate arbitrary faulty and operating conditions. Second, fast weighted feature-space averaging (FWFSA) as a new data augmentation technique is developed to augment the simulated faulty data, producing infinite reality-augmented simulation data. The proposed MBS-FWFSA can fit in arbitrary MFD algorithms and transfer-learning settings with minimal effort. Moreover, an in-depth empirical study has been carried out to investigate the causality between condition variations and robustness. A new metric has been defined to evaluate robustness. The experiments also revealed the effect of the proposed MBS-FWFSA and its outperformance against several state-of-the-art augmentation methods.

However, as most current and commercial AVs are closed-source solutions, in practice, little is known about their real internals: information such as what is a typical AV database size, the detection methods effectively used in each operation mode, and how often on average the AVs are updated are still unknown. This prevents research work from meeting the industrial practices more thoroughly. To fill this gap, in this work, we systematize the knowledge about AVs. To do so, we first surveyed the literature and identified existing knowledge gaps in AV internalsâ working. Further, we bridged these gaps by analyzing popular (Windows, Linux, and Android) AV solutions to check their operations in practice. Our methodology encompassed multiple techniques, from tracing to fuzzing. We detail current AVâs architecture, including their multiple components, such as browser extensions and injected libraries, regarding their implementation, monitoring features, and self-protection capabilities.

In that case, efficient reconfiguration of the original service composition under practical constraints is critical; however, existing research scarcely focuses on it. This paper proposes a dynamic service composition reconfiguration model to bridge the gap by considering practical constraints (DSCRPC) in a real-life cloud manufacturing environment. Based on the constraints considered in this study, the DSCRPC model redefines three objectives: time (T*), cost (C*), and product service quality (Q*S*). To optimize the DSCRPC model, this study developed an adaptive multi-population multi-objective whale optimization algorithm (AMPOWOA) based on the Pareto strategy. The algorithm adopts four balancing strategies and adaptively optimizes and adjusts the key parameters under various balancing strategies through well-designed reinforcement learning models. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments and actual application case tests to compare the performances of AMPOWOA and other algorithms (MOWOA, MOHHO, NSGA-II). The results show that DSCRPC can continuously tackle the cloud manufacturing service composition (CMSC) reconfiguration issue with constraints until an order is completed.

However, dynamic control of these resources in concert with traditional building loads, to effect efficiency and demand flexibility, is not yet commonplace in commercial control products. Traditional rule-based control algorithms do not offer integrated closed-loop control to optimize across systems, and most often, PV and battery systems are operated for energy arbitrage and demand charge management, and not for the provision of grid services. More advanced control approaches, such as MPC control have not been widely adopted in industry because they require significant expertise to develop and deploy. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer a promising option to optimize the operation of DER systems and building loads with reduced setup effort. However, there are limited studies that evaluate the efficacy of these methods to control multiple building subsystems simultaneously.

Many image forensic techniques are proposed earlier, but their effectiveness falls short on real-world images shared over microblogging sites. As forged images shared over these platforms are typically altered using multiple manipulation techniques, it is hard for forensic techniques to detect them. This paper proposes a customized convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism to spot fake images shared over microblogging platforms. Deep learning convolutional networks learn the intrinsic feature set of images and can detect the forged images. To handle multiple manipulations in an image, the applied attention mechanism focuses on the most relevant image region to learn the inherent feature sets. The model utilizes High-pass filters from the image processing domain to initialize kernel weights of the neural network. This supports the proposed model to converge faster and achieve better accuracy. The pooling layers are designed to specifically handle images from microblogging sites. The solution is universal and can detect complex tampering scenarios like text-editing, face-swapping, copy-move, splicing and mirroring. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is utilized to localize the manipulated region in a forged image. LIME also adds interpretability and confidence to the proposed model, a common concern in deep learning models. The model is verified against the publicly available CASIA 2.0 dataset. An accuracy score of 94.7% is achieved, which is better than the previous state-of-art papers in fake image detection. In order to test the model on real-world images published on Twitter, a recent dataset is built from an Indian viewpoint. The model achieves a modest accuracy of 83.2% over the real-world Twitter dataset. The experiment proves that the proposed model can accurately detect the forged images over social platforms. It can be utilized in the fact-checking field to improve manual efforts. It will also support manual fact-checkers in swift decision making.",industry

The significant role of manufacturing strategy deployment is selecting the production system best suited for a manufacturing firm. The appropriately chosen production system (strategic process choice) facilitates a firm to produce âorder winningâ outputs and provides a production competence to achieve business success. This research presents a novel framework to determine the compatible production system for a manufacturing firm. An integrated three-stage Delphi-MCDM-Bayesian Network (BN) framework has been proposed. The process choice criteria (PCC) considered for deciding production systems are identified through an in-depth literature review and then validated by experts through a Delphi method in the first stage. It resulted in the determination of twenty-six PCC. In the second stage, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) method is adopted to determine each criterion's relative importance for a firm. The relative weights obtained are then used as input for the machine learning (ML) technique- Bayesian network (BN) in the third stage. The BN model quantifies the selection probability of production systems. The proposed Delphi-MCDM-BN framework is demonstrated using a real-life case of a âhydraulic and pneumatic valveâ manufacturing firm to select a suitable production system. The three-stage framework is a novel contribution to the literature, which can be used by researchers, practitioners, and manufacturing strategists to choose an appropriate production system for any manufacturing firm.",industry

Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server.

Amoxicillin as an antibiotic is one of the EPs and categorized as the Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) in hazardous materials. Accumulation of amoxicillin in the soil bulk increases the cancer risk, drug resistances and other epidemiological diseases. Hence, the soil bioremediation of antibiotics can be a solution for this problem which is more environmental-friendly system. This study technically creates a bio-engine setup in soil bulk for remediation of amoxicillin based on Aspergillus Flavus (AF) activities and Removal Percentage (RP) of amoxicillin with Aflatoxin B1 Generation (AG) controls. The main novelty is to propose a hybrid computational intelligence approach to do optimization for mechanical and biological aspects and to predict the behavior of bio-engine's effective mechanical and biological features in an intelligent way. The optimization model is formulated by the Central Composite Design (CCD) which is set by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The prediction model is formulated by the Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Tree (RT) algorithms. According to the experimental practices from real soil samples in different times and places, concentration of amoxicillin and Aflatoxin B1 are set equal to 25Â mg/L (ppm) and 15Â Î¼g/L (ppb). Likewise, the outcomes of experiments in CCD-RSM computations are evaluated by curve fitting comparisons between linear, 2FI, quadratic and cubic polynomial equations with considering to regression coefficient and predicted regression coefficient values, ANOVA and optimization by sequential differentiation. Based on the results of CCD-RSM, the RP performance in the optimum conditions is measured around 86% and in 25 days after runtime, the RP and AG are balanced in the safe mode.

The modeling method of digital cores can be divided into the physical experimental methods and numerical simulation methods. Physical experimental methods usually are time-consuming and expensive because the drilling and core sampling for physical experiments are quite costly and the manufacturing of experimental samples sometimes are difficult to implement. Without the complex physical preparation and the demands for expensive equipment, numerical simulation methods are relatively cost-effective but still suffer from a lengthy processing time. Recently, deep learning and its variants can effectively extract characteristics from training images (TIs), casting light on the fast reconstruction of digital cores. In this paper, a reconstruction method is proposed by combining the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the generative adversarial network (GAN) to achieve the balance of their strengths and weaknesses.

To construct a high-performance WMPC model, a large amount of labeled training data is required, which entails a high annotation cost for engineers. To reduce the annotation cost, an active learning framework has been investigated, in which annotation is conducted at the individual wafer map level. If wafer maps can be grouped into clusters based on the similarity of defect patterns, then annotation can be performed at the cluster level rather than at the wafer map level, thereby affording cost effectiveness. Based on the cluster-level annotation, we propose an active cluster annotation to obtain a high-performance WMPC model with reduced annotation cost. For a dataset annotated only for a small subset of wafer maps, clustering is first conducted for unlabeled wafer maps. In an active learning iteration, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed with labeled wafer maps. Subsequently, the cluster-level classification uncertainties of the CNN for unlabeled wafer maps are calculated. With the uncertainties, the query clusters are selected and annotated by an engineer at the cluster level. The performance of the CNN is improved cost-effectively by repeating these iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on real-world data from a semiconductor manufacturer. In addition, we show that cluster-level annotation is a robust annotation method that can yield consistent labels.",industry

However, existing deep learning methods for RUL prediction are not completely successful due to the following two reasons. First, relying on a single objective function to estimate the RUL will limit the learned representations and thus affect the prediction accuracy. Second, while longer sequences are more informative for modelling the sensor dynamics of equipment, existing methods are less effective to deal with very long sequences, as they mainly focus on the latest information. To address these two problems, we develop a novel attention-based sequence to sequence with auxiliary task (ATS2S) model. In particular, our model jointly optimizes both reconstruction loss to empower our model with predictive capabilities (by predicting next input sequence given current input sequence) and RUL prediction loss to minimize the difference between the predicted RUL and actual RUL. Furthermore, to better handle longer sequences, we employ the attention mechanism to focus on all the important input information during the training process. Finally, we propose a new dual-latent feature representation to integrate the encoder features and decoder hidden states, to capture rich semantic information in data. We conduct extensive experiments on four real datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method.

Applications of computer vision are growing in importance in livestock systems due to their ability to generate real-time, non-invasive, and accurate animal-level information. However, the development of a computer vision system requires sophisticated statistical and computational approaches for efficient data management and appropriate data mining, as it involves massive datasets. This article aims to provide an overview of how deep learning has been implemented in computer vision systems used in livestock, and how such implementation can be an effective tool to predict animal phenotypes and to accelerate the development of predictive modeling for precise management decisions. First, we reviewed the most recent milestones achieved with computer vision systems and the respective deep learning algorithms implemented in Animal Science studies. Then, we reviewed the published research studies in Animal Science which used deep learning algorithms as the primary analytical strategy for image classification, object detection, object segmentation, and feature extraction. The great number of reviewed articles published in the last few years demonstrates the high interest and rapid development of deep learning algorithms in computer vision systems across livestock species. Deep learning algorithms for computer vision systems, such as Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO (v3 and v4), DeepLab v3, U-Net and others have been used in Animal Science research studies. Additionally, network architectures such as ResNet, Inception, Xception, and VGG16 have been implemented in several studies across livestock species. The great performance of these deep learning algorithms suggests an improved predictive ability in livestock applications and a faster inference. However, only a few articles fully described the deep learning algorithms and their implementation. Thus, information regarding hyperparameter tuning, pre-trained weights, deep learning backbone, and hierarchical data structure were missing. We summarized peer-reviewed articles by computer vision tasks (image classification, object detection, and object segmentation), deep learning algorithms, animal species, and phenotypes including animal identification and behavior, feed intake, animal body weight, and many others.

Machine learning (ML) methods have been implemented to improve understanding of defect formation in AM-built parts and controlling process variability in real-time. However, modern ML methods, in particular deep neural networks, are empowered by massive high-quality labeled data, which are limited in AM due to the following reasons: First, large data labeling is often tedious, costly, and requires substantial human efforts with considerable expertise. Second, the performance of the learning methods depends to a great extent on the presence of positive data instances (i.e., defective) as they are more informative for monitoring. Third, the rare positives result in a severe imbalanced dataset poses critical challenges in training ML methods designed with the assumption that the input contains an equal number of instances from each class. In this research, we propose novel annotation and learning with limited number of data through the integration of active search and hyperdimensional computing (HDC).

Efficient management of the commercial ponds for healthy production of prawns is the key mantra of success in this industry. It is a necessity to maintain the water quality parameters in these ponds within specific ranges to create an ideal environment of optimal growth of healthy prawns. The current practice of water quality data collection and their usage for decision making on most farms is not efficient and does not take full advantage of the latest technologies. The research presented in this paper aimed at addressing this problem by systematic investigation and development of an integrated framework where (i) modern sensors were investigated for their suitability and deployed for continuous monitoring of the water quality variables in prawn ponds; (ii) novel machine learning models were investigated based on collected data and deployed to accurately forecast pond status over next 24 h. This provides farmers insight into upcoming situations and take necessary measures to avoid catastrophic situations; and (iii) augmented reality-based visualisation methods were investigated for improved data capture process and efficient decision making through real-time interactive interfaces. The paper presents the integrated framework as well as the details of sensing, machine learning, and augmented reality components. We found that (i) YSI EXO2 Multi-Sonde is the best sensor for continuous monitoring of prawn ponds; (ii) ForecastNet (our developed machine learning model) provides best forecasting results with symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 6.1 %, 9.6 %, and 8.5 % for dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature; and (iii) augmented reality-based interactive interface achieves accuracy as high as 89.2 % for management decisions with at least 41 % less time.

It is known that deep learning features can depict the complex behavior of the froth surface more comprehensively and accurately than handcrafted features. However, few studies have tried to use additional information to improve flotation performance through optimal control. To this end, we have attempted to develop a novel deep learning feature-based two-layer optimal control scheme. The first layer is proposed for setpoint generation of high-dimensional features using improved fuzzy association rule reasoning. Then, an offline conservative double Q-learning control layer that can learn from historical industrial records by mitigating bootstrapping error in action value functions is developed. The proposed method can adapt the setpoint to the change in process feeds. Meanwhile, in contrast to traditional approximate dynamic programming methods that need to interact with real/simulated process systems, this controller can work without any further interactions, which makes it possible to transfer the success of reinforcement learning algorithms to complex industrial process control where opportunities to explore are missing. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and promising for practical flotation process control.",industry

To effectively aid the reduction of energy consumption in the building sector, the development of demand-driven control systems for heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) is necessary. In countries with temperate climates such as the UK, many buildings depend on natural ventilation strategies such as openable windows, which are useful for reducing overheating prevalence during the summer. The manual opening and adjustment of windows by occupants, particularly during the heating season, can lead to substantial heat loss and consequent energy consumption. This could also result in the unnecessary or over ventilation of the space, or the fresh air is more than what is required to ensure adequate air quality. Furthermore, energy losses build up when windows are left open for extended periods. Hence, it is important to develop control strategies that can detect and recognise the period and amount of window opening in real-time and at the same time adjust the HVAC systems to minimise energy wastage and maintain indoor environment quality and thermal comfort. This paper presents a vision-based deep learning framework for the detection and recognition of manual window operation in buildings. A trained deep learning model is deployed into an artificial intelligence-powered camera. To assess the proposed strategy's capabilities, building energy simulation was used with various operation profiles of the opening of the windows based on various scenarios. Initial experimental tests were conducted within a university lecture room with a south-facing window. Deep learning influenced profile (DLIP) was generated via the framework, which uses real-time window detection and recognition data. The generated DLIP were compared with the actual observations, and the initial detection results showed that the method was capable of identifying windows that were opened and had an average accuracy of 97.29%. The results for the three scenarios showed that the proposed strategy could potentially be used to help adjust the HVAC setpoint or alert the occupants or building managers to prevent unnecessary heating demand. Further developments include enhancing the framework ability to detect multiple window opening types and sizes and the detection accuracy by optimising the model.",industry

Customer churn prediction is a crucial tool to support customer retention. It allows an early identification of customers who are at risk to abandon the company and provides the ability to gain insights into why customers are at risk. Hence, customer churn prediction models should complement predictive performance with model insights. Inspired by their ability to reconcile strong predictive performance and interpretability, this study introduces rule ensembles and their extension, spline-rule ensembles, as a promising family of classification algorithms to the customer churn prediction domain. Spline-rule ensembles combine the flexibility of a tree-based ensemble classifier with the simplicity of regression analysis. They do, however, neglect the relatedness between potentially conflicting model components which can introduce unnecessary complexity in the models and compromises model interpretability. To tackle this issue, a novel algorithmic extension, spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization (SRE-SGL) is proposed to enhance interpretability through structured regularization. Experiments on fourteen real-world customer churn data sets in different industries (i) demonstrate the superior predictive performance of spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso over a set well yet powerful benchmark methods in terms of AUC and top decile lift; (ii) show that spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization significantly outperform conventional rule ensembles whilst performing at least as well as conventional spline-rule ensembles; and (iii) illustrate the interpretable nature of a spline-rule ensemble model and the advantage of structured regularization in SRE-SGL by means of a case study on customer churn prediction for a telecommunications company.",industry

Shaft orbit images generated from turbomachine vibration signals have been used to diagnose component faults. However, the existing methods were developed mostly by either using features extracted from orbits or utilizing simulation data which may produce inaccurate results in practical applications due to system complexity and data uncertainties. This paper presents a novel deep learning convolution neural network methodology for accurately automatic diagnostics of multiple faults in general rotating machines by adeptly integrating advanced signal processing with orbit images augmentation, considering the high non-linearity and uncertainty of sensed vibration signals. Environmental noise in vibration signals are filtered through the integration of multiresolution discrete wavelet packet transform and Bayesian hypothesis testing-based automatic thresholding.

A short-term production schedule determines the daily/weekly/monthly sequence of extraction, the destination of materials and utilization of processing streams. This paper presents a novel self-learning artificial intelligence algorithm for mining complexes that learns, from its own experience, to adapt the short-term production scheduling decisions by responding to incoming new information. The algorithm plays the game of short-term production scheduling on its own using a Monte Carlo tree search to train a deep neural network agent that adapts the short-term production schedule with incoming new information. The deep neural network agent evaluates the short-term production scheduling decisions and, in parallel, performs searches using the Monte Carlo tree search to generate experiences. The experiences are then used to train the agent. The agent improves the strength of the tree search, which results in an even stronger self-play to generate better experiences. An application of the proposed algorithm at a real-world copper mining complex shows its exceptional performance to adapt the 13-week short-term production schedule almost in real-time.

To perform this assessment, it is necessary to use state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, such as deep learning, so that tools, components, and actions may be identified by visual control systems. We develop a deep-learning-based visual control assembly assistant that enables real-time evaluation of the activities in the assembly process so that errors can be identified. A general-use language is developed to describe the actions in assembly processes, which can also be used independently of the proposed architecture. Finally, we generate two datasets with annotated data to be fed to the deep learning methods, the first for the recognition of tools and accessories and the second for the identification of basic actions in manufacturing processes. To validate the proposed method, a set of experiments are conducted, and high accuracy is obtained.",industry

Many intelligent air quality monitoring networks have been deployed in various places, especially in big cities. These monitoring networks collect air quality data with some missing data for some reasons which pose an obstacle for air quality publishing and studies. Generative adversarial nets (GAN) methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in missing data imputation. GAN-based imputation method needs enough training data while one monitoring network has just a few and poor quality monitoring data and these data sets do not meet the independent identical distribution (IID) condition. Therefore, one monitoring network side needs to utilize more monitoring data from other sides as far as possible. However, in the real world, these air quality monitoring networks are owned by different organizations â companies, the government even some secret units. Many of them cannot share detailed monitoring data due to security, privacy, and industrial competition. In this paper, it is the first time to propose a conditional GAN imputation method under a federated learning framework to solve the data sets that come from diverse data-owners without sharing. Furthermore, we improve the vanilla conditional GAN performance with Wasserstein distance and âHint maskâ trick. The experimental results show that our GAN-based imputation methods can achieve the best performance. And our federated GAN imputation method outperforms the GAN imputation method trained locally for each participant which means our imputation model can work. Our proposed federated GAN method can benefit model quality by increasing access to air quality data through private multi-institutional collaborations. We further investigate the effects of data geographical distribution across collaborating participants on model quality and, interestingly, we find that the GAN training process with a federated learning framework performs more stable.",industry

In this paper, we propose a DTL framework CDAR, namely conditional distribution deep adaptation in regression. As only few labeled target data is available, in addition to only considering the prediction accuracy of individual samples, CDAR aims to preserve the global properties of the conditional distribution dominated by the target data. Thus, a hybrid loss function is constructed by combining the mean square error (MSE) and conditional embedding operator discrepancy (CEOD) in CDAR, and the target model is able to be finetuned by minimizing the designed loss function through back-propagation.

This could include monitoring an electronic perimeter fence or a critical infrastructure such as telecom and power grids. Such applications rely on the fidelity of data reported from the IoT devices, and hence it is imperative to identify the trustworthiness of the remote device before taking decisions. Existing approaches use a secret key usually stored in volatile or non-volatile memory for creating an encrypted digital signature. However, these techniques are vulnerable to malicious attacks and have significant computation and energy overhead. This paper presents a novel device-specific identifier, IoT-ID that captures the device characteristics and can be used towards device identification. IoT-ID is based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs), that exploit variations in the manufacturing process to derive a unique fingerprint for integrated circuits. In this work, we design novel PUFs for Commercially Off the Shelf (COTS) components such as clock oscillators and ADC, to derive IoT-ID for a device. Hitherto, system component PUFs are invasive and rely on additional dedicated hardware circuitry to create a unique fingerprint. A highlight of our PUFs is doing away with special hardware. IoT-ID is non-invasive and can be invoked using simple software APIs running on COTS components. IoT-ID has the following key properties viz., constructability, real-time, uniqueness, and reproducibility, making them robust device-specific identifiers.

However, widespread applications and market penetration of such components are often hindered by the formation of common defects that affect part quality, reliability, and serviceability, and increase the cost. Here, for the first time, we show that a combination of physics-informed machine learning, mechanistic modeling, and experimental data can reduce the occurrence of common defects in additive manufacturing. By analyzing experimental data on the defect formation for commonly used alloys available in the disjointed, peer-reviewed literature, we identify several important variables that reveal the physics behind the defect formation. Values of those variables computed using a mechanistic model, when used in a physics-informed machine learning, provide the hierarchical importance of the variables on defect formation. In addition, based on the results of the physics-informed machine learning, we provide easy-to-use, verifiable, quantitative formalism that can be used in real-time to predict defects before experiments. The proposed methodology can help in reducing common defects such as balling, cracking, lack of fusion, porosity, and surface roughness, and solve other complex engineering problems beyond additive manufacturing.",industry

In this paper we propose an approach based on an extension of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for robot velocity regulation in industrial-like environments characterized by uncertain motion difficulties. The velocity selected by POMCP is used by a standard engine controller which deals with path planning. This two-layer approach allows POMCP to exploit prior knowledge on the relationships between task similarities to improve performance in terms of time spent to traverse a path with obstacles. We also propose three measures to support human-understanding of the strategy used by POMCP to improve the performance. The overall architecture is tested on a Turtlebot3 in two environments, a rectangular path and a realistic production line in a research lab. Tests performed on a C++ simulator confirm the capability of the proposed approach to profitably use prior knowledge, achieving a performance improvement from 0.7% to 3.1% depending on the complexity of the path. Experiments on a Unity simulator show that the proposed two-layer approach outperforms also single-layer approaches based only on the engine controller (i.e., without the POMCP layer). In this case the performance improvement is up to 37% comparing to a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning engine controller, and up to 51% comparing to the standard ROS engine controller.

Many anomaly detection methods are inefficient and easy to lose effective information due to manual features extracting. Deep learning-based methods can solve the problem effectively, but the detection accuracy is still not satisfactory. In addition, most of the methods cannot take the time-ordered specialty into account which is significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. To address these issues, a novel method named deep sequence multi-distribution adversarial model (DSMDA) is proposed to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection in bearing condition monitoring. The proposed model utilizes the data reconstruction capability of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) under the framework of generative adversarial network (GAN) to make full use of information. The feedforward neural network layer of VAE is replaced by the long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) layer, which uses the forgetting mechanism of LSTM to effectively avoid the false alarms caused by the excessive influence of the old sequences. Additionally, the fault-attention abnormal state index can be constructed by the real-time spatial distribution and latent spatial distribution features learned by the double discriminators. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on two public datasets are carried out with only healthy data in training stage that is more suitable for practical industrial applications. The results show that the proposed method is superior to GANomaly and other advanced methods. Furthermore, the 2-D visualization results can indicate the level of fault while the last feature space of the two discriminators is combined and embedded into the visualization, and the fault-attention abnormal state indictor constructed on these features can indicate abnormalities well.",industry

The effectiveness of anomaly detectors can be assessed by subjecting them to test suites of attacks, but less consideration has been given to adversarial attackers that craft noise specifically designed to deceive them. While successfully applied in domains such as images and audio, adversarial attacks are much harder to implement in CPSs due to the presence of other built-in defence mechanisms such as rule checkers (or invariant checkers). In this work, we present an adversarial attack that simultaneously evades the anomaly detectors and rule checkers of a CPS. Inspired by existing gradient-based approaches, our adversarial attack crafts noise over the sensor and actuator values, then uses a genetic algorithm to optimise the latter, ensuring that the neural network and the rule checking system are both deceived. We implemented our approach for two real-world critical infrastructure testbeds, successfully reducing the classification accuracy of their detectors by over 50% on average, while simultaneously avoiding detection by rule checkers.

The HHO algorithm mimics the cooperative behavior of Harris Hawks and their foraging behavior in nature called surprise pounce. HHO benefits from a small number of controlling parameters setting, simplicity of implementation, and a high level of exploration and exploitation. To alleviate the drawbacks of this algorithm, a modified version called Nonlinear based Chaotic Harris Hawks Optimization (NCHHO) is proposed in this paper. NCHHO uses chaotic and nonlinear control parameters to improve HHOâs optimization performance. The main goal of using the chaotic maps in the proposed method is to improve the exploratory behavior of HHO. In addition, this paper introduces a nonlinear control parameter to adjust HHOâs exploratory and exploitative behaviors. The proposed NCHHO algorithm shows an improved performance using a variety of chaotic maps that were implemented to identify the most effective one, and tested on several well-known benchmark functions. The paper also considers solving an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimization problem that showcases the applicability of NCHHO in solving large-scale, real-world problems. The results demonstrate that the NCHHO algorithm is very competitive, and often superior, compared to the other algorithms.

Due to the technical and economic challenges in upgrading to a fully SDN-enabled network, hybrid SDN, with a partial deployment of SDN switches in a traditional network, has been a prevailing network architecture. Meanwhile, Traffic Engineering (TE) in the hydbrid SDN has attracted wide attentions from academia and industry. Previous studies on TE in the hybrid SDN are either traffic-oblivious or time-consuming, which causes routing schemes failed in responding to the dynamically-changing traffic rapidly and intelligently. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based method, which learns a traffic-splitting agent to address the dynamically-changing traffic and achieve the link load balancing in the hybrid SDN. Specifically, to rapidly and intelligently determine a routing scheme to the new traffic demands, a traffic-splitting agent is designed and learnt offline by exploiting the RL algorithm to establish the direct relationship between traffic demands and traffic-splitting policies. Once the traffic-splitting agent is learnt, the effective traffic-splitting policies, which are used to determine the traffic-splitting ratios on SDN switches, can be generated rapidly. Additionally, to meet the interactive requirements for learning a traffic-splitting agent, a reasonable simulation environment is proposed to be constructed to avoid routing loops when traffic-splitting policies are taken. Extensive evaluations on different topologies and real traffic demands demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the comparable network performance and performs superiorities in rapidly generating the satisfying routing schemes.",industry

However, the implementation of NMPC in real time has two challenges: Firstly, the design of an accurate non-linear model, which can run many times faster than real time. Secondly, the usage of a rapid and reliable optimization algorithm to solve the optimization problem in real time. To solve these issues, the constrained MIMO NMPC is created based on the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm as a result of its clarity, ease of use, and capacity to deal with problems in one algorithm. In addition, seven ensembles of eight multi-input single-output (MISO) non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models are used as a base model for the GPC controller to predict the future process outputs. Estimation of free and forced responses of the GPC based on the neural network (NN) model of the plant each sampling time without performing instantaneous linearization is proposed in this study, which reduces the NMPC optimization problem to a linear optimization problem at each sampling step.

Although it is one of the most studied stock market anomalies, the current literature is often limited in explaining this phenomenon by a small number of factors using simpler regression methods. In this paper, we use a machine learning based approach instead, and aim to capture the PEAD dynamics using data from a large group of stocks and a wide range of both fundamental and technical factors. Our model is built around the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and uses a long list of engineered input features based on quarterly financial announcement data from 1,106 companies in the Russell 1000 index between 1997 and 2018. We perform numerous experiments on PEAD predictions and analysis and have the following contributions to the literature. First, we show how Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift can be analysed using machine learning methods and demonstrate such methodsâ prowess in credibly forecasting the drift direction. It is the first time PEAD dynamics are studied using XGBoost. We show that the drift direction is driven by different factors for stocks from different industrial sectors and in different quarters and XGBoost is effective in understanding the changing dynamics. Second, we show that an XGBoost well optimised by a Genetic Algorithm can help allocate out-of-sample stocks to form portfolios with higher positive returns to long and portfolios with lower negative returns to short, a finding that could be adopted in the process of developing market neutral strategies. Third, we show how theoretical event-driven stock strategies have to grapple with ever-changing market prices in reality, reducing their effectiveness. We present a tactic to remedy the difficulty of buying into a moving market when trading on PEAD signals.",industry

Therefore, in this work, we present a novel approach that does not require manual selection of feature sets and then delivers them to the classifier, using deep learning theory and convolutional neural network (ConvNets) to automatically detect driver drowsiness based on multi-channel EEG signals during real driving. The proposed 12-layer deep ConvNets model automatically learns and extracts the most prominent features from the raw EEG data through 5 convolutional layers, 3 max pooling layers and 1 mean pooling layer and optimizes the classification results through 3 fully connected layers at the same time, which is an end-to-end manner. To overcome the lack of a large amount of EEG data, a data augmentation strategy is proposed. The proposed deep ConvNets model is trained on 4 s segments of EEG data from different participants and tested using a 10-fold cross validation.

Meanwhile, the scarcity of fault data and different working conditions lead to serious data imbalance and distribution differences, which make a great challenge for planetary gearbox fault detection and diagnosis. To address these issues, a novel adaptive normalized convolutional neural network (ANCNN) is developed to accurately and automatically diagnose the different fault locations and severities of planetary gearbox considering the scenarios of complex variable working conditions and data imbalance. First, Teager calculated order (TCO) spectrum is applied to avoid the influences of large speed fluctuations and variable loads, which is an efficient pretreatment approach for the proposed ANCNN. Then, the batch normalization algorithm is adopted to eliminate the feature distribution differences caused by variable operating modes and data imbalance. Finally, in order to automatically adapt to different planetary gearbox diagnosis circumstances, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategy is used for optimizing and flexibly deciding the key hyperparameters of the designed model, thereby improving the overall performance of the model. The effectiveness of the presented method is confirmed through experiments on two different planetary gearbox datasets, which are from a generic planetary gearbox for industrial applications and a drivetrain dynamic simulator test rig. In addition, comparison with other mainstream intelligent diagnosis techniques validates the superiority of the presented method. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented method can achieve diagnostic accuracies of better than 99.8%, and also shows excellent stability for the unbalanced data classification.",industry

The current 3D human body reconstruction technology requires complex external equipment to scan all angles of the human body, which is complicated to be implemented and cannot be popularized. In order to solve this problem, this paper applies deep learning models on reconstructing 3D human body based on monocular images. First of all, this paper uses Stacked Hourglass network to perform convolution operations on monocular images collected from different views. Then Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are used to decode the encoded high-level images. The feature codes in the two views(main and side) are fused, and the interior and exterior points are classified by the fusion features, so as to obtain the corresponding 3D occupancy field. At last, the Marching Cube algorithm is used for 3D reconstruction with a specific threshold and then we use Laplace smoothing algorithm to remove artifacts. This paper proposes a dense sampling strategy based on the important joint points of the human body, which has a certain optimization effect on the realization of high-precision 3D reconstruction. The performance of the proposed scheme has been validated on the open source datasets, MGN dataset and the THuman dataset, provided by Tsinghua University. The proposed scheme can reconstruct features such as clothing folds, color textures, and facial details,and has great potential to be applied in different applications.",industry

SCN uses a supervisory random mechanism to assign its input weights and hidden biases, which makes it more stable than other randomized algorithms but also leads to time-consuming model training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel bidirectional SCN algorithm (BSCN) in this paper, which divides the way of adding hidden nodes into two modes: forward learning and backward learning. In the forward learning mode, BSCN still uses the supervisory mechanism to configure the parameters of the newly added nodes, which is the same as SCN. In the backward learning mode, BSCN calculates the parameters at one time based on the residual error feedback of the current model. The two learning modes are performed iteratively until the prediction error of the model reaches an acceptable level or the number of hidden nodes reaches its maximum value. This semi-random learning mechanism greatly speeds up the training efficiency of the BSCN model and significantly improves the quality of the hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark regression problems, two real-life air pollution prediction problems, and a classical image processing problem show that BSCN can achieve faster training speed, higher stability, and better generalization ability than SCN.",industry

The majority of existing work overwhelmingly learn node embeddings in the context of static, plain or attributed, homogeneous graphs. However, many real-world applications frequently involve bipartite graphs with temporal and attributed interaction edges, named temporal interaction graphs. The temporal interactions usually imply different facets of interest and might even evolve over the time, thus putting forward huge challenges in learning effective node representations. Furthermore, most existing graph embedding models try to embed all the information of each node into a single vector representation, which is insufficient to characterize the nodeâs multifaceted properties. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named TigeCMN to learn node representations from a sequence of temporal interactions. Specifically, we devise two coupled memory networks to store and update node embeddings in the external matrices explicitly and dynamically, which forms deep matrix representations and thus could enhance the expressiveness of the node embeddings. Then, we generate node embedding from two parts: a static embedding that encodes its stationary properties and a dynamic embedding induced from memory matrix that models its temporal interaction patterns. We conduct extensive experiments on various real-world datasets covering the tasks of node classification, recommendation and visualization. The experimental results empirically demonstrate that TigeCMN can achieve significant gains compared with recent state-of-the-art baselines.",industry

Engineered iron oxide nanoparticles have been widely tested in AOPs catalysis, but their full potential as magnetic induction self-heating catalysts has not been studied yet on real and highly contaminated industrial wastewaters. In this study we have designed a self-heating catalyst with a finely tuned structure of small cores (10Â nm) aggregates to develop multicore particles (40Â nm) with high magnetic moment and high colloidal stability. This nanocatalyst, that can be separated by magnetic harvesting, is able to increase reaction temperatures (up to 90Â Â°C at 1Â mg/mL suspension in 5Â min) under the action of alternating magnetic fields. This efficient heating was tested in the degradation of a model compound (methyl orange) and real wastewaters, such as leachate from a solid landfill (LIX) and colored wastewater from a textile industry (TIW). It was possible to increase reaction rates leading to a reduction of the chemical oxygen demand of 50 and 90%, for TIW and LIX. These high removal and degradation ability of the magnetic nanocatalyst was sustained with the formation of strong reactive oxygen species by a Fenton-like mechanism as proved by electron paramagnetic resonance.

However, the classification and forecasting of wear rates in friction related processes is a real industrial challenge that is unsolved today. Hence, an on-line monitoring system able to classify wear rate can be crucial for many industries as it could help in preventing catastrophic failures. Applications include lifetime assessment of various industrial components where a range of wear failures occur such as scuffing (a typical sudden failure mechanism). These tribological processes can now be sensorized, and the corresponding sensor signatures can be modelled and monitored using state-of-the-art Machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, we use an Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor and ML frameworks to classify different wear categories simulated with a customized pin-on-disc tribometer. A real-time investigation of the wear track is necessary to find out the origins of the wear scar visible at the surface. To achieve this objective, the experiments were conducted on a pin-on-disc tribometer equipped with a Digital Holographic Microscope (DHM). Experiments were carried out using alumina and steel balls against steel discs at room temperature. Real-time DHM images of the wear track surface were recorded for each lap at the same position. An acoustic emission sensor recorded the AE signals during the complete duration of experiments. The AE signatures, in combination with the real-time DHM images, were correlated as input and ground truth labels for the ML algorithm. Several ML frameworks were compared; they are support vector machine, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, quadratic discriminant analysis and Naive Bayes. The classifier was trained to differentiate the acoustic emission features of the different wear rates. Most ML algorithms had an average classification accuracy above 80%, and the highest was obtained with support vector machine (84.7%). The classification accuracy can be improved by combining two neighboring categories with limited differences in terms of wear rate. Hence, the proposed method has a significant industrial potential for in-situ and real-time quality monitoring of wear processes since it requires minimum modifications of commercially available industrial machines.",industry

However, we found that very often they were significantly biased by their use of data containing information that was a direct consequence of a company reaching some level of success (or failure). Such an approach is a classic example of the look-ahead bias. It leads to very optimistic test results, but any attempt at using such an approach in a real-world scenario may result in dramatic consequences. We designed our experiments in a way that would prevent the leaking of any information unavailable at the decision moment to the training set.
                  We compared three algorithms â logistic regression, support vector machine, and the gradient boosting classifier. Despite the conscious decision to limit the number of predictors, we reached very promising results in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores which, for the best model, were 57%, 34%, and 43% respectively. The best outcomes were obtained with the gradient boosting classifier. We give detailed information about the importance of different features, with the top three being country and region that the company operates in and the companyâs industry. Our model can be applied directly as a decision support system for different types of venture capital funds.",industry

However, they have a deficiency in evaluating the quality of the attributed community structure, which may mislead them and discover less valuable structures.

The practical and challenging scenario is investigated, where the training and testing data are from different machinery operating conditions, and no target-domain run-to-failure data is available for training. In the deep learning framework, data alignment schemes are proposed in the representation sub-space, including healthy state alignment, degradation direction alignment, degradation level regularization and degradation fusion. In this way, the life-cycle data of different machine entities across domains can follow the same degradation trace, thus achieving prognostic knowledge transfer.

The success of these advanced methods depends on the assumption that enough labeled samples for each fault type are available. However, in some practical situations, it is extremely difficult to collect enough data, e.g., when the sudden catastrophic failure happens, only a few samples can be acquired before the system shuts down. This phenomenon leads to the few-shot fault diagnosis aiming at distinguishing the failure attribution accurately under very limited data conditions. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called Feature Space Metric-based Meta-learning Model (FSM3), to overcome the challenge of the few-shot fault diagnosis under multiple limited data conditions. Our method is a mixture of general supervised learning and episodic metric meta-learning, which will exploit both the attribute information from individual samples and the similarity information from sample groups. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms a series of baseline methods on the 1-shot and 5-shot learning tasks of bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis across various limited data conditions. The time complexity and implementation difficulty have been analyzed to show that our method has relatively high feasibility.

However, the volume of data in a hyperspectral image is large (order of Gigabytes) and standard off-the-shelf algorithms for multi-channel image analysis cannot be readily applied, due to the prohibitive computational time and large memory requirements. Therefore, new scalable approaches are required to perform hyperspectral image analysis. In this article we address an efficient methodology for conducting Unsupervised Image Segmentation â one of the basic and most fundamental image analysis operations. In the methodology proposed, unsupervised segmentation is conducted after transforming the spectral and spatial dimensions of the raw hyperspectral image into a more compact representation using multivariate and multiresolution techniques. The clusters identified in the compact image representation are then used to train a discriminative classifier. The classifier is then adapted and transferred for application to the raw image, where it will efficiently label all the original pixels. With the proposed methodology, the computational expensive operations (unsupervised clustering and classifier learning) are minimized, whereas the efficient implementation of the classifier guarantees the analysis at the native resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested on a real case study considering an industrial hyperspectral image capturing the reflectance spectrum for several objects made of different unknown materials. A significant reduction in the computational cost was achieved without compromising the quality of the unsupervised segmentation, demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach.",industry

In this paper, a novel meta-learning fault diagnosis method (MLFD) based on model-agnostic meta-learning is proposed to address this issue. The raw signals of different working conditions are first converted to timeâfrequency images and then randomly sampled to form tasks for MLFD according to the protocol of meta-learning. The MLFD model acquires prior knowledge by optimizing initialization parameters based on multiple fault classification tasks of known working conditions during the meta-training process, and achieves fast and accurate few-shot bearing fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions by leveraging the learned knowledge.

Despite its great promise in fabrication flexibility, print quality has long been a major barrier for its widespread implementation.

In-situ monitoring methods by relying on the in-process sensor data, on the other hand, can provide viable alternatives to aid with the online detection of anomalies during the process. Given the crucial importance of melt pool characteristics to the quality of final products, this paper provides a framework to process the melt pool images by a configuration of Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) neural networks. The networkâs corresponding bottleneck layer learns a deep yet low-dimensional representation from melt pools while preserving the spatial correlation and complex features intrinsic in the images.

To tackle these challenges, a feedback model based on a multi-input neural network is proposed to evaluate the sintering status accurately by integrating the thermal history and process features. Subsequently, a layerwise feedback control strategy is proposed to process the discrete sintering status into the variation trend of part quality and ensure that the material has the desired thermal history during sintering.

Nonlinear systems, such as neutralization reactors, provide special challenges to MPC design. Linear prediction models may be inadequate to describe the process at all operating points. One alternative is the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as prediction models. ANNs are nonlinear structures that can be trained to reproduce the process behavior. Inside MPC schemes, ANNs can rapidly predict the process response to a control action. The time-consuming step for ANN training is to obtain a representative overall data set from experiments or simulation data from the studied process. In the present work, we propose to obtain this data set from computational simulations using a first principles model. However, mismatches were found between rigorous simulation and actual pH process responses. Those deviations were naturally transferred to the internal neural model, as a consequence, actual control problems were identified. Avoiding high costs of performing actual experimental runs for ANN and MPC design, we used a real-time adaptation algorithm, based on extended Kalman filter (EKF), that acts to correct the ANN prediction while process is running. The adaptive model ANN-based MPC was able to maintain the actual controlled process, in all operating conditions tested. The sum of square error of pH was reduced in 64.3%, compared to the ANN-based MPC without model adaptation. Using a Kalman filter to adapt the internal model has significantly improved the MPC performance, reducing oscillations and maintaining the controlled variable in the setpoint, even in servo regulatory situations of industrial practice.

If the RBTE reduces by 30%, the weight reduction of the entire component will reach up to tens of kilograms while improving the dynamic balance performance of the large component. Current RBTE control requires the off-process measurement of limited discrete points on the component bottom to provide the reference value for compensation. This leads to incompleteness in the remaining bottom thickness control and redundant measurement in manufacturing. In this paper, the framework of data-driven physics based model is proposed and developed for the real-time prediction of critical quality for large components, which enables accurate prediction and compensation of RBTE value for the thin wall components.

Some research on recommender systems utilizes the usersâ interaction history on items to represent the usersâ interests, which has achieved remarkable success. Usersâ interests in the real world are dynamically changing and have a strong correlation with the interaction sequence. However, sometimes usersâ interests are less relevant to the order of the current interaction sequence, but are more relevant to certain items in the user interaction history. In this paper, a novel deep neural network model is proposed to deal with this situation. The developed model consists of two parts: the present interest relevant to the order of the interaction sequence and the comprehensive interest relevant to some items in the interaction sequence. An ancillary multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is constructed to improve the training of our model. Experiments on public and industrial datasets are conducted.

Besides, these questions should follow not only natural expressions but also user-interested aspects simultaneously. For this challenging task, an innovative generative adversarial net-based QG model is proposed â a generator featuring multi-source attention mechanism is employed to yield questions from multiple information sources; a discriminator featuring quality control is applied to fine-tune generated questions in terms of both language performance and aspect compatibility.

Renewables have been developed fast, however, the intermittent nature has imposed higher requirement for the flexibility of the power grid. Retrofitting carbon capture technologies to existing fossil-fuel fired power plants is an important solution to avoid the âlock-inâ of emissions, but the high operating costs hinders their large scale application. The coexistence of renewable power and carbon capture opens up a new avenue that the deployment of carbon capture can provide additional flexibility for better accommodation of renewable power while excess renewables can be used to reduce the operating costs of carbon capture. To this end, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence based optimal scheduling strategy for the power plant-carbon capture system in the context of renewable power penetration to show that the mutual benefits between carbon capture and renewable power can be achieved when the carbon capture process is made fully adjustable. An artificial intelligent deep belief neural network is used to reflect the complex interactions between carbon, heat and electricity within the power plant carbon capture system. Multiple operating goals are considered in the scheduling such as minimizing the operating costs, renewable power curtailment and carbon emission, and the particle swarm heuristic optimization is employed to find the optimal solution. The impacts of carbon capture constraint mode, carbon emission penalty coefficient, carbon dioxide production constraints and renewable power installed capacity are investigated to provide broader insight on the potential benefit of carbon capture in future low-carbon energy system. A case study using real world data of weather condition and load demand shows that renewable power curtailment can be reduced by 51% with the integration of post-combustion capture systems and 35% of total carbon emission are captured by the use of excess renewable power through optimal scheduling.

Nowadays, the baseline state of the art systems has quite a low accuracy and high computations, which needs upgrading to make it reasonable for real-time industrial uses such as detection of content from speech data. The main intent for low recognition rate and high computational cost is a scarceness of datasets, model configuration, and patterns recognition that is the supreme stimulating work for building a robust SER system. In this study, we address these problems and propose a simple and lightweight deep learning-based self-attention module (SAM) for SER system. The transitional features map is given to SAM, which produces efficiently the channel and spatial axes attention map with insignificant overheads.

Therefore, the leached metal solutions are expected to contain ultra-high metal concentrations, up to 10Â mol/l. These solutions will have challenging thermodynamic properties (increased density, viscosity and interfacial tension). As a result, an analysis of dimensionless numbers for fluidics and mass transport was made, showing that some of these are favourable under the constraints of accessible microfluidic operations. Experiments were performed with advanced microfluidic reactors (a coiled-flow inverter (CFI) and an industrial re-entrance flow reactor from CorningÂ®) at high metal concentrations and high nickel to cobalt ratios (3:0.3Â mol/l Ni:Co). Using Cyanex 272 as a selective extractant for cobalt, extraction efficiencies of 60% with high separation factors (>1000) were reached in just one extraction stage. The CFI showed high extraction efficiency for low fluid velocities and a residence time of 60Â s. For the CorningÂ® reactor, high fluid velocities or the use of many modules (>3) are needed to obtain an emulsion, resulting in high extraction efficiencies at a very short residence time of 13Â s. The comparison between the CFI and the CorningÂ® reactor shows that they share the best operation point (at 120Â ml/h), but the CorningÂ® reactor performs better at higher flow rates and thus can leverage higher productivity. However, the CFI is easier to operate and has a much lower pressure drop, resulting in low energy input.

It not only poses occupational safety hazards such as suffocation or lung disorders for exposed persons but is often extremely explosible in ignition sensitive environment. This probability of explosion can be assessed and minimised with in-depth knowledge of controlling parameters/physical properties that trigger the ignition. This research takes into account the minimum ignition temperature (MIT), which is the control parameter for explosion risk assessment. MIT relies on multiple factors, such as moisture content, particle size, dust concentration, dispersion pressure, humidity and environmental temperature. In this study, the ignition of corn dust clouds was analysed using a Godbert Greenwald furnace for different combinations of dispersion pressure and concentrations. Test findings revealed that the minimum ignition temperature rises with a decrease in particle size. However, the minimum ignition temperature decreases with increased dispersion pressure and concentration until a specific value known as optimal value for ignition. Moreover, this work focuses on a statistical approach of polynomial surface fitting to forecast the MIT based on the combined impact of concentration and dispersion pressure on MIT for corn dust in a real-time experiment. The minimum value of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to select the most appropriate polynomial model due to its authenticity and strong reputation. An artificial neural network (ANN) is also used as a predictive tool to develop a model that can forecast the MIT with a defined combination of dispersion pressures and corn dust concentrations. As soon as an appropriate estimation of this minimum ignition temperature of the combustible dust is confirmed, it is possible to ensure that the temperatures of the surrounding hot surfaces do not rise to that point to prevent the explosion. The predictive results obtained from ANN were found to be good when compared with the polynomial surface fit.

This paper introduces a multivariate approach to predict manufacturer's demand for components throughout multiple forecast horizons using different leading indicators of demand shifts. We compare the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) with Machine Learning (ML) models. Using a real case study, we empirically evaluate the forecasting and supply chain performance of the multivariate regression models over the component's life-cycle. The experiments show that the proposed multivariate approach provides superior forecasting and inventory performance compared with traditional univariate benchmarks. Moreover, it reveals applicable throughout the component's life-cycle, not just to a single stage.

Improper optimization of the LENS process parameters may lead to defects, such as porosity and cracks, in the manufactured parts. Cracks, for instance, can adversely affect the mechanical properties of the parts, which may render them unserviceable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop online nondestructive testing (NDT) methods to monitor and detect the defects. As an important NDT method, laser spot thermography (LST) has drawn great attention due to its characteristics of non-contact and high-sensitivity. In this study, we design a laser spot scanning system, which can exert a multi-mode point heat source. A new technique combined with laser spot thermography and neural network is developed to characterize the crack parameters in LENS components. The temperature and its gradient at the crack location are extracted and used as inputs for training the neural network. The trained neural network builds a relationship between the input (temperature signal) and output (crack width) data. After verifying the reliability of the neural network by conducting numerical simulations and experiments with artificial cracks, the widths of real cracks in LENS samples are evaluated.

In the initial and normal stage, the tool wear was slow because of the protection of the adhesive titanium layer and dense alumina film. Diffusion wear and oxidation wear occurred until the sever wear stage. Based on the above wear mechanism determination, after acquiring the real time cutting force, the tool wear prediction models were established using a convolutional bi-directional long short-term memory networks (CNNÂ +Â BILSTM) and a convolutional bi-directional gated recurrent unit (CNNÂ +Â BIGRU).

In this paper, the structure of the air transport network is analyzed with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to reduce the number of airways and to aggregate the passengers and also to reduce route changes and the travel time fortravelers. The proposed topology model of this study is based on the combination of two topologies â point-to-point and hub-and-spoke â with multiple goals for decreasing in airways and travel length per passenger and also to reach the minimum number of air stops per passenger. Four state-of-the-art Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) are considered for comparison studies and are tested and assessed in data of the Iran airline industry in 2018, as an experiment to real-world applications. Using the combination of point-to-point and hub-and-spoke topologies can improve the performance of the MOGA to solve a network-wide flight trajectory planning. Based on Iran airline traffic patterns in 2018, the proposed model successfully decreased 50.8% of air routes (184 air routes) compared to the current situations while the average travel length and the average changes in routes were increased up to 13.8% (about 100Â km) and up to 18%, respectively. The proposed model also suggests that the current air routes of Iran can be decreased to 24.7% (89 airways) if the travel length and the number of changes increase up to 4.5% (32Â km) and 5%, respectively.

Existing TCM methods for UMW require offline high-resolution measurement of tool surface profiles, which leads to undesirable production downtime and delayed decision-making. This paper proposes a completely online TCM system for UMW using sensor fusion and machine learning (ML) techniques. A data acquisition (DAQ) system is designed and implemented to obtain in-situ sensing signals during welding processes. A large feature pool is then extracted from the sensing signals.

The best-performing classification models can achieve close to 100% classification accuracy for both training and test datasets.

Acoustic signals for these categories have been decomposed with wavelet packets, and sub-band energies have been chosen as features. Then, only the most informative features were selected via standard linear principal component analysis. Finally, the classification was performed via a traditional support vector machine.

China, Brazil, and other countries have proposed standard methods to detect the addition of benzoic acid in food. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an upcoming spectral detection technique, which has been widely used in the field of material analysis with the advantages of non-invasive, fast detection speed and complex environment with little interference. To detect the illegal use of benzoic acid in dairy industry, we developed Ag-COF (covalent-organic framework) material as SERS substrate to detect benzoic acid in liquid milk. The great enhancement ability of Ag-COF substrate is controlled by the addition of acetic acid and complex interplay between COF material and benzoic acid. This detection method has high sensitivity and reliability that allows us to achieve limit of detection (LOD) of 0.13 Î¼g/mL in milk and 0.00372 Î¼g/mL in water by applying this method. In experiment on recovery rate of real samples, the detection time is less than 15 minutes and the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 2.82% to 5.69%.

Additionally, it is a complex multi-criteria problem due to the need to optimize overall energy use while satisfying usersâ comfort. Both conventional rule-based (RB) controllers, which are difficult to apply in multi-loop settings, and advanced model-based controllers, which require an accurate building model, cannot fulfil the requirements of the building automation industry to solve this problem optimally at low development and commissioning costs. This work presents a fully data-driven pipeline to obtain an optimal control policy from historical building and weather data, thus avoiding the need for complex physics-based modelling. We demonstrate the potential of this method by jointly controlling a room temperature and an EV to minimize the cost of electricity while retaining the comfort of the occupants. We model the room temperature with a recurrent neural network and use it as a simulation environment to learn a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control policy. It achieves on average 17% energy savings and 19% better comfort satisfaction than a standard RB room temperature controller. When a bidirectional EV is connected additionally and a two-tariff electricity pricing is applied, it successfully leverages the battery and decreases the overall cost of electricity. Finally, we deployed it on a real building, where it achieved up to 30% energy savings while maintaining similar comfort levels compared to a conventional RB room temperature controller.",industry

Process qualification traditionally involves employing elaborate experimental methods to find the response surface mapping the response to various process parameters and measurements. Most of the existing methods are passive experimental designs which take into account the limits of the parameter space and a design method (CCD, Taguchi, orthogonal etc.) to identify the points in the parameter space. More often than not, these methods need a lot of experiments to be conducted and do not take into account how the response changes with each experiment. Also, the number of experiments increase combinatorically to get a desired estimate of the response surface. The formulation of mathematical models for complex, high dimensional, inherently nonstationary, and stochastic systems like abrasive machining process and also catering to the process-machine interactions is challenging. In this work, to address the other alternative for cost-effective experimentation: we adapt a Query by Committee (QBC) based active learning approach where we sequentially find the next best experimental point to reduce the uncertainty of prediction of surface roughness over the sample space. The method uses a carefully curated list of committee members, (i.e., models) which predict the response surface at each instant and selects the next experimental point based on a metric called prediction deviation. We used a real-world dataset from a cylindrical plunge grinding platform to test if the QBC approach performs better than a passive CCD design. The machine tool used is the next generation precision grinder (NGPG) from IIT Madras which is capable to finishing components to an IT3 tolerance grade. We compared the QBC based active learning model to a previous random forest model built on a dataset which gave a test accuracy (R

Within operations research, over the last 25 years the use of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), known as reinforcement learning in many disciplines, to solve these types of problems has increased in popularity. These efforts have resulted in the successful deployment of ADP-generated decision policies for driver scheduling in the trucking industry, locomotive planning and management, and managing high-value spare parts in manufacturing.

Aiming to sustain competitive advantage and intensify customer loyalty, full-service providers offer the use of their products as a service to achieve continuous revenues. For this purpose, companies implement AI classification algorithms to enable high levels of service at controllable costs. However, traditional asset sellers who become service providers require previously atypical payment structures, as classic payment methods involving a one-time fee for production costs and profit margins are unsuitable. In addition, a low predictive power of the implemented classification algorithm can lead to misclassifications, which diminish the achievable level of service and the intended net present value of the resultant service. While previous works focus solely on the costs of such misclassifications, our decision model highlights implications for payment structures, service levels, and â ultimately â the net present value of such data-driven service offerings.

We propose a data allocation method based on Distributed Deep Neural Networks (DDNN) framework, which allocates data to edge servers or stays locally for processing. DDNN divides deep learning tasks and deploys pre-trained shallow neural networks and deep neural networks at local or edges, respectively. However, all data is processed locally, and the failure is sent to the edge server or the cloud. It will lead to excessive pressure on local terminal equipment and long-term idle edge servers, which cannot meet industrial productionâs real-time requirements on user privacy and time-sensitive tasks. In this paper, the complexity and inference error rate of machine learning model, the data processing speed of local equipment and edge server, and the transmission time are comprehensively considered to establish the system model.

The raw sugarcane bagasse and the biosorbent SBM were characterized by scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and porous structure. Batch experiments were carried out on the effect of the effluent pH, contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate, adsorbent dosage, particle size, and effluent color concentration on the adsorption process. The best-operating conditions found were in an acid medium, using an SBM particle size of 0.7 mm, and a dosage of 0.6 g, which allowed a color removal of 100 % for an initial true color concentration of 149 PtCo.Lâ1. The multilayer feed-forward neural network, with five inputs and one output, was trained with eight neurons in the hidden layer. A comparison between the experimental data and the predicted by ANN model showed that color removal results fitted very well to the model with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.928 and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.013. Nonlinear adjustments were made to the kinetic and adsorption isotherm models. In general, the adsorption process with SBM proved to be a promising method for the treatment of textile effluent, and the developed ANN model can be successfully used to make predictions for the final color of the effluent.",industry

As a proof of concept, CNNs were applied to image data from both, in- and at-line OCT implementations, monitoring film-coated tablets as well as single- and multi-layered pellets. CNN results were compared against results from established algorithms based on ellipse-fitting, as well as to human-annotated ground truth data. Performance benchmarks used include, efficiency (computation speed), sensitivity (number of detections from a defined test set) and accuracy (deviation from the reference method). The results were validated by comparing the output of several algorithms to data manually annotated by human experts and microscopy images of cross-sectional cuts of the same dosage forms as a reference method. In order to guarantee comparability for all results, the algorithms were executed on the same hardware. Since modern OCT systems must operate under real-time conditions in order to be implemented in-line into manufacturing lines, the necessary steps are discussed on how to achieve this goal without sacrificing the algorithmic performance and how to tailor a deep CNN to cope with the high amount of image noise and alterations in object appearance. The developed deep learning approach outperforms static algorithms currently available in pharma applications with respect to performance benchmarks, and represents the next level in real time evaluation of challenging industrial OCT image data.",industry

In many industries, there are classical models that capture the fundamentals of general planning decisions (e.g., designing a delivery route). However, these models are generic and often require customization to truly reflect the realities of specific operational settings. Yet, such customization can be an expensive and time-consuming process. At the same time, popular cloud computing software platforms such as Software as a Service (SaaS) are not amenable to customized software applications. We present a framework that has the potential to autonomously customize optimization models by learning mathematical representations of customer-specific business rules from historical data derived from model solutions and implemented plans. Because of the wide-spread use in practice of mixed integer linear programs (MILP) and the power of MILP solvers, the framework is designed for MILP models. It uses a common mathematical representation for different optimization models and business rules, which it encodes in a standard data structure. As a result, a software provider employing this framework can develop and maintain a single code-base while meeting the needs of different customers. We assess the effectiveness of this framework on multiple classical MILPs used in the planning of logistics and supply chain operations and with different business rules that must be observed by implementable plans.

In this work, we aim to solve rumor detection task under the framework of representation learning.

Then we propose a gated graph neural network based algorithm called PGNN, which can generate powerful representations for each node in the propagation graph. The proposed PGNN algorithm repeatedly updates node representations by exchanging information between the neighbor nodes via relation paths within a limited time steps. On this basis, we propose two models, namely GLO-PGNN (rumor detection model based on the global embedding with propagation graph neural network) and ENS-PGNN (rumor detection model based on the ensemble learning with propagation graph neural network). They respectively adopt different classification strategies for rumor detection task, and further improve the performance by including attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the weight of each node in the propagation graph.

This ensemble optimizer is formulated to perform operation improvement and update the targeted LGI automatically when a higher index is achieved for continuous improvement.

Meanwhile, a portable neuroimaging device â Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was also utilized to collect userâs brain activities by measuring hemodynamic responses associated with neuron behavior. A humanâsubject experiment (nÂ =Â 16) was conducted to evaluate participantsâ neural activity patterns and physiological metrics (gaze movement) related to their stress status and final task performance. Each participant was required to review the operational instructions for a pipe maintenance task for a short period and then perform the task based on their memory in both normal and stressful scenarios. Our experiment results indicated that stressful training had a strong impact on participantsâ neural connectivity patterns and final performance, suggesting the use of stressors during training to be an important and useful control factors. We further found significant correlations between gaze movement patterns in review phase and final task performance, and between the neural features and final task performance. In summary, we proposed a variety of supervised machine learning classification models that use the fNIRS data in the review session to estimate individualâs task performance. The classification models were validated with the k-fold (kÂ =Â 10) cross-validation method. The Random Forest classification model achieved the best average classification accuracy (80.38%) in classifying participantsâ task performance compared to other classification models. The contribution of our study is to help establish the knowledge and methodological basis for an early warning and estimating system of the final task performance based on the neurophysiological measures during the training for industrial operations. These findings are expected to provide more evidence about an early performance warning and prediction system based on a hybrid neurophysiological measure method, inspiring the design of a cognition-driven personalized training system for industrial workers.",industry

This kind of industrial inspection robots is expected to automatically detect anomalous structures (e.g., defects, damages, rejects, etc.) from the images of the manufactured products. Generally, the existing visual anomaly detection (VAD) methods mainly focus on modeling the complex and high-dimensional distribution of normal data, while neglecting the specific visual properties of abnormal data since their frequency of occurrence is much less than that of the normal data. In this paper, inspired by the human cognition on extracting abstractly visual properties and to distinguish the anomaly patterns from the observed data, we propose a novel cognitive VAD method for industrial inspection robot. Specifically, we introduce a constrained latent space to mimic the cognitive ability of humans, where the abstraction learned from the observed normal and anomaly data are represented. We build our method based on a convolutional generative adversarial network and a denoising auto-encoder, where the adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to establish the boundary between the normal and anomaly data. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a real-world dataset where the images are captured for the manufactured products. The comprehensive results comparing with several recent VAD methods show that the proposed method is effective to detect the anomaly images of different categories with a high accuracy.",industry

However, in the real world industrial application, the dissimilarity of data due to changes in the working conditions and data acquisition environment often cause a poor performance of the existing fault diagnosis methods. Consequently, to address these inadequacies, this paper developed a novel method by integrating the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithms. Named as âVariational Mode Decomposition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (VMD-DCNNs)â, the method, in an end-to-end way, directly processes raw vibration signals without artificial experiences and manual intervention to realize the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. In addition, the CNN technique is used to extract features from each Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) in order to address the deficiency in extracting features from a single source and to achieve an effective and efficient fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under different environments and states. The value of parameter K of the VMD-DCNNs model is optimized by considering time complexity and generalization ability of the model. Lastly, bearing experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the VMD-DCNNs in diagnosing fault under different conditions. The visualizations of the signals in the convolutional layer explain the reasonability in selecting the value of parameter K and they also indicate that the translational invariances in a raw IMF component have been learned by the VMD-DCNNs model.",industry

The timely and accurate prediction for key quality characteristics of separated coal plays a significant role in condition monitoring and production control. However, these quality characteristics are usually difficult to directly measure online in industrial practices Although some computation intelligence based soft sensor modeling methods have been developed and reported in existing research for these quality variables estimation, some problems still exist, i.e., manual feature extraction, considerable unlabeled data, temporal dynamic behavior in data, which will influence the accuracy and efficiency for established soft sensor model. To address above-mentioned problem and develop an more excellent quality prediction model for coal preparation process, a novel deep learning based semi-supervised soft sensor modeling approach is proposed which combining the advantage of unsupervised deep learning technique (i.e., Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE)) with the advantage of supervised deep bidirectional recurrent learner (i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)). More specifically, the unsupervised SAE networks are implemented to learn the representative features hidden in all available input data (labeled and unlabeled samples) and store them as context vector. Then, partial context vector with corresponding labels and the quality variable measure value at previous time are concatenated to form a new merged input feature vector. After that, the temporal and dynamic features are further extracted from the new merged input feature vector via BLSTM networks. Subsequently, the fully connected layers (FCs) are exploited to learn the higher-level features from the last hidden layer of the BLSTM. Lastly, the learned output features by FCs are fed into a supervised liner regression layer to predict the coal quality metrics. Meanwhile, to avoid over-fitting, some regularization techniques are utilized and discussed in proposed network.

Most notably, holonic architectures are defined in terms of their world-of-interest (Van Brussel et al., 1998). They do not have an information layer, a communication layer, etc. Instead, they have components that relate to real-world assets (e.g. machine tools) and activities (e.g. assembly). And, they mirror and track the structure of their world-of-interest, which allows them to scale and adapt accordingly.
                  This research has wandered around, at times learning from its mistakes, and progressively carved out an invariant structure while it translated and applied scientific insights from complex-adaptive systems theory (e.g. autocatalytic sets) and from bounded rationality (e.g. holons). This paper presents and discusses the outcome of these research efforts.
                  At the top level, the holonic structure distinguishes intelligent beings (or digital twins) from intelligent agents. These digital twins inherit the consistency from reality, which they mirror. They are intelligent beings when they reflect what exists in the world without imposing artificial limitations in this reality. Consequently, a conflict with a digital twin is a conflict with reality.
                  In contrast, intelligent agents typically transform NP-hard challenges into computations with low-polynomial complexity. Unavoidably, this involves arbitrariness (e.g. donât care choices). Likewise, relying on case-specific properties, to ensure an outcome in polynomial time, usually renders the validity of an agentâs choices both short-lived and situation-dependent. Here, intelligent agents create conflicts by imposing limitations of their own making in their world-of-interest.
                  Real-world smart systems are aggregates comprising both intelligent beings and intelligent agents. They are performers. Inside these performers, digital twins may constitute the foundations, supporting walls, support beams and pillars because these intelligent beings are protected by their real-world counterpart. Further refining the top-level of this architecture, a holonic structure enables these digital twins to shadow their real-world counterpart whenever it changes, adapts and evolves.
                  In contrast, the artificial limitations, imposed by the intelligent agents, cannot be allowed to build up inertia, which would hamper the undoing of arbitrary or case-specific limitations. To this end, performers explicitly manage the rights over their assets. Revoking such rights from a limitation-imposing agent will free the assets. This will be at the cost of reduced services from the agent. When other service providers rely on this agent, their services may be affected as well; thatâs how the inertia builds up and how harmful legacy is created. Thus, the services of digital twins are to be preferred over the services of an intelligent agent by developers of holonic manufacturing systems.
                  Finally, digital twins corresponding to the decision making in the world-of-interest (a non-physical asset) allow to mirror the world-of-interest in a predictive mode (in addition to track and trace). It allows to generate short-term forecasts while preserving the benefits of intelligent beings. These twins are the intentions of the decision-making intelligent agents. Evidently, when intentions change, the forecasts needs to be regenerated (i.e. tracking the corresponding reality by the twin). This advanced feature can be deployed in a number of configurations (cf. annex).",industry

The control architecture is distributed at the edge of the shop floor for data collecting and format transformation, and then centralized at the cloud computing platform for data aggregation, machine learning and intelligent decisions.

Traditional approaches for tracking control of mobile robots usually require the computation of Jacobian-inverse or linearization of its mathematical model. The proposed algorithm uses a nature-inspired optimization approach to directly solve the nonlinear optimization problem without any further transformation. First, we formulate the tracking control as a constrained optimization problem. The optimization problem is formulated on position-level to avoid the computationally expensive Jacobian-inversion. The nonholonomic limitation is ensured by adding equality constraints to the formulated optimization problem. We then present the Beetle Antennae Olfactory Recurrent Neural Network (BAORNN) algorithm to solve the optimization problem efficiently using very few mathematical operations. We present a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and show that its computational cost is linear with respect to the degree of freedoms (DOFs), i.e., O(m).

The unique feature extraction method consists of three stages: extraction of time-domain features from the vibration signals, dimension-reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) and dimension-increment by the integrated radial basis function based kernel principal component analysis (KPCA_IRBF).

                  Methods
                  Normal human articular chondrocytes (NHACs) were cultured with varying concentrations of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) and/or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) to optimize the culture condition for thickness-wise growth of chondrocytes. Next, the tissues grown in the optimal condition were subjected to re-differentiation culture in attached and detached states to assess differentiation capacity by evaluating secreted factors, histological analysis, and a gene expression assay.
               
                  Results
                  NHACs grew thickness-wise efficiently in the presence of 1Â ng/mL TGF-Î²1 and 10Â ng/mL FGF-2. After two weeks of culture, NHACs grew with 11-fold higher thickness and 16-fold higher cell number compared to cells which were neither treated with TGF-Î²1 nor with FGF-2. These thickness-wise-grown chondrocytes could be re-differentiated by a differentiation medium according to the increase in melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) and positive safranin-O staining. Interestingly, the cartilaginous gene expression was considerably different between the attached and detached conditions even in the same culture medium, indicating the necessity of detachment and shrinkage to achieve further differentiation.

                      This application is valuable in the fields of military, industry, and aerospace. However, the accuracy of recognizing the readings of pointer meters by machine vision is, oftentimes, affected by several factors, such as uneven illumination in each image, large range variation of illumination in different images, complex backgrounds, tilting of pointer meters, image blur, and scale change, resulting in the recognized readings with unacceptable accuracy. In this paper, a new robust approach to reading recognition of pointer meters is proposed. The proposed method consists of three main contributions: (1) constructing a novel deep learning algorithm in which the PrRoIPooling is used in lieu of the RoiAlign in the existing Mask-RCNN, (2) classifying the type of pointer meters while fitting the pointer binary mask, and (3) calculating the readings of pointer meters by the proposed angle method. In addition, we also report and release a new dataset for the community. Experiments show that the new algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of the recognized readings of pointer meters, meanwhile, the proposed approach is also robust to the natural environments and computationally efficient.",industry

Even industrial electronic component and system design also prefer same slim fashion. On other hand the overheating of electronic components reduces its performance, life and by the way the reliability of such electronic product/system is greatly affected due to overheating. The conventional cooling methods failed to offer best performances. Hence this part of research proposed a effective two phase cooling technique with nano-fluid. The objective of this research is to maintain the maximum temperature at the junction and hot spots in order to break a new ground in the cooling of electronic systems. The Maximum permissible operating temperature for any commercial electronic applications is only upto 70Â Â°C (equal to 343.15Â K) and above which most of the inherent electronic circuits may malfunction and destroy the entire application.The HotSpot Simulator-6.0 software employed for establish, verify the simulated model and trial runs to answer many âwhat ifâ questions.

Due to its low rigidity, serious machining error may occur, therefore, Finite Element method and mechanism analysis are usually utilized to modeling its deformation. However, they are very time-consuming and only suitable for elastic deformation error. In this study, an integrated error compensation method is proposed based on on-machine measurement (OMM) inspection and error compensation. The OMM inspection is firstly applied to measure the comprehensive machining errors. The Hampel filtering is then used to eliminate outliers, followed by the triangulation-based cubic interpolation as well as a machine learning algorithm which are used to establish the compensation model. At last, the real time compensation of high-density cutting points is realized by developing the compensation system based on External Machine Zero Point Shift (EMZPS) function of machine tool. Three sets of machining experiment of a typical thin web part are conducted to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. Experiment results revealed that after compensation, the comprehensive machining errors were controlled under different machining conditions and 58.1%, 68.4% and 62.6% of the machining error ranges were decreased, respectively.

Optical diagnostics of two-phase bubbly flows with modern panoramic techniques makes it possible to capture simultaneously instantaneous characteristics of both continuous and dispersed phases with a high spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on neural networks to recognize bubble patterns in images and identify their geometric parameters. The originality of the proposed method consists in training of a neural network ensemble using synthetic images that resemble real photographs gathered in experiment. The use of neural networks in combination with automatically generated data allowed us to detect overlapping, blurred, and non-spherical bubbles in a broad range of volume gas fractions. Experiments on a turbulent bubbly jet proved that the implemented method increases the identification accuracy, reducing errors of various kinds, and lowers the processing time compared to conventional recognition methods. Furthermore, utilizing the new method of bubbles recognition, the primary physical parameters of a dispersed phase, such as bubble size distribution and local gas content, were calculated in a near-to-nozzle region of the bubbly jet.

However, the state of the Turkish fisheries is in critical condition as both the quality (i.e, in number of caught species, value and sizes of fish) and quantity of fisheries catches have been rapidly declining in recent decades. One pioneer fisheries management initiative thoroughly evaluated here pertains to minimum landing size (MLS) regulations for commercial taxa, with the aim of promoting stock sustainability by ensuring fish reproduce before they are caught. This study examines 29 taxa in relation to MLS by analyzing changes in catch per unit effort trends pre-and post MLS to gauge regulation effectiveness, changes to MLS regulations since implementation, and finally evaluates the Turkish MLS sizes in relation to Turkish maturity sizes, to provide advice for taxa requiring changes. It seems intensive fishing may have reduced the size at maturity for many species in Turkey, as they mature smaller here than the Mediterranean and global averages. Eleven taxa listed in MLS regulations are under the lengths of first maturity (Lmat) sizes in Turkish waters and need to be increased, especially that of bonito, hake, swordfish and bluefish (by 18Â cm, 10Â cm, 10Â cm and 8Â cm, respectively), while 16 taxa still require national studies to determine their Lmat sizes in Turkish waters. In conclusion, in Turkey, MLS regulations are completely ineffective due to a lack of monitoring and control for juvenile fish at landing sites, markets and processing plants, along with insufficient penalties for such infractions, yet, there remains plenty of room for improvement. To improve the state of the fisheries, MLS measures could be improved by increasing fines, monitoring and control, making some gear types more selective and use of real-time closures and no fishing zones to protect spawning and nursery habitats.",industry

Two classic feature engineering methods of Order Tracking and Fast Fourier Transform give us inspirations to solve these problems. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation algorithm based on the core assumption of Order Tracking and present a self-adaptive convolutional neural network for fault diagnosis. The data augmentation algorithm utilizes resampling technique to simulate data under different rotating speeds and working loads, in which the Fast Fourier Transform is embedded alternately to calculate the frequency spectra of the expanded dataset. Based on the robust features in the spectra, the self-adaptive convolutional architecture is designed with much fewer Floating Points Operations (FLOPs) and trainable parameters than the deep counterparts, by which the extracted features are invariant for generalization and discriminative for classification.

Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study.

Novelty detection aims to identify observations that deviate from a determined normal behaviour. Only instances of one class are known, whereas so called novelties are unlabelled. Traditional novelty detection applies methods from the field of outlier detection. These standard one-class classification approaches have limited performance in many real business cases. The traditional techniques are mainly developed for industrial problems such as machine condition monitoring. When applying these to human behaviour, the performance drops significantly. This paper proposes a method that improves existing approaches by creating semi-synthetic novelties in order to have labelled data for the two classes.

Generally, a good number of rebars are required by a design code, particularly at member connections. As such, rebar clashes (i.e., collisions and congestions) would be inevitable. It would be impractical, labor-intensive, and error-prone to avoid all possible clashes manually or even using standard design software. The building information modeling (BIM) technology has been utilized by the present architecture, engineering, and construction (ACE) industry for clash-free rebar designs. However, most existing BIM-based approaches offer the clash resolution strategy for moving components with an optimization algorithm, and are only applicable to the RC structures with regular shapes. In particular, the optimized path of rebars cannot be adjusted to avoid the obstacles, thus limiting the practical applications. Furthermore, most existing studies lack the learning from design code and constructibility constraints to realize automatic and intelligent arrangement and adjustment of rebars for avoiding the obstacles encountered in complex RC joints and frame structures. Considering these shortcomings, the authors have recently proposed an immediate reward-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system with BIM, towards automatic clash-free rebar designs of RC joints without clashes. However, as the immediate reward is required in the MARL system for guiding the learning of a rebar design, it will not succeed in clash-free rebar designs of complex RC structures where immediate reward is often unavailable. In this study, this study further extends the previous work with Q-learning (a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm) for more realistic path planning considering both immediate and delayed rewards in clash-free rebar designs for real-world RC structures. In particular, the rebar design problem is treated as a path-planning problem of multi-agent system, where each rebar is deemed as an intelligence reinforcement learning agent. Next, by employing the Q-learning as the reinforcement learning engine, the particular form of state, action, and immediate and delayed rewards for the reinforcement MARL for automatic rebar designs considering more actual constructible constraints and design codes can be developed. Comprehensive experiments on three typical beam-column joints and a two-story RC building frame were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The study results of paths of rebar designs, success rates, and average time confirm that the proposed framework with MARL and BIM is effective and efficient.",industry

In this work, a novel multivariate calibration strategy for the at-line prediction of etanercept, a recombinant protein produced in a mammalian cells-based perfusion process, is presented. For data generation, samples from etanercept processes were daily obtained, from which fluorescence excitation-emission matrices were generated in the spectral ranges of 225.0 and 495.0Â nm and 250.0 and 599.5Â nm for excitation and emission modes, respectively. These data were correlated with etanercept concentration in supernatant (measured by an off-line HPLC-based reference univariate technique) by implementing different chemometric strategies, in order to build predictive models. Partial least squares (PLS) regression evidenced a non-linear relation between signal and concentration when observing actual vs. predicted concentrations. Hence, a non-parametric approach was implemented, based on a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP). The MLP topology was optimized by means of the response surface methodology.

UCF predicts a userâs interest in an item based on rating information from similar user profiles. A neural network UCF model can learn effectively the high-order relations between users and items, but it cannot distinguish the importance of users in learning process. To mine the complex relationships between users and items, we incorporate a Deep+Shadow pattern to improve learning features effectively, namely as DeepUCF. Firstly, we define historical users, that is, users from the historical data of interactions with an item. The target user and historical users are calculated to capture complex process of userâs interacted item. Secondly, we integrate a shallow linear model to effectively solve single pair interaction problems. Finally, DeepUCF construct of a pair of user relations (interactive users with a history of items) for the input, and joint linear and nonlinear models to build relationships between users. More importantly, DeepUCF+a add an attention network to distinguish the historical user importance of items, which make DeepUCF more expressive. Experiments on real datasets show that DeepUCF and DeepUCF+a can effectively capture usersâ complex high-order relationships, and achieve better performance.",industry

In recent years, recognition methods such as neural networks have been receiving increasing attention due to their great merits of high diagnostic accuracy and easy implementation. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of broiler stunned state recognition, an improved fast region-based convolutional neural network (You Only Look OnceÂ +Â Multilayer Residual Module (YOLOÂ +Â MRM)) algorithm was proposed and applied to the recognition of three broiler stunned states: insufficient, appropriate and excessive stuns. The images were collected from a broiler-slaughtering line using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. The area of the head and wings of a broiler in the original image was marked according to the PASCAL VOC data format and the dataset of each broiler stunned state was obtained. The results showed that the YOLOÂ +Â MRM algorithm achieved good performance with an accuracy of 96.77%. To compare YOLOÂ +Â MRM with other models, similar experiments were conducted using a conventional back propagation neural network (BP-NN) classifier, as well as YOLO, and the recognition accuracies were 90.11% and 94.74%, respectively. YOLOÂ +Â MRM can complete the detection task of more than 180,000 broilers per hour.

                  Medical knowledge graph (KG) is attracting attention from both academic and healthcare industry due to its power in intelligent healthcare applications. In this paper, we introduce a systematic approach to build medical KG from electronic medical records (EMRs) with evaluation by both technical experiments and end to end application examples.
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  The original data set contains 16,217,270 de-identified clinical visit data of 3,767,198 patients. The KG construction procedure includes 8 steps, which are data preparation, entity recognition, entity normalization, relation extraction, property calculation, graph cleaning, related-entity ranking, and graph embedding respectively. We propose a novel quadruplet structure to represent medical knowledge instead of the classical triplet in KG. A novel related-entity ranking function considering probability, specificity and reliability (PSR) is proposed. Besides, probabilistic translation on hyperplanes (PrTransH) algorithm is used to learn graph embedding for the generated KG.
               
                  Results
                  A medical KG with 9 entity types including disease, symptom, etc. was established, which contains 22,508 entities and 579,094 quadruplets. Compared with term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) method, the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@10) increased from 0.799 to 0.906 with the proposed ranking function. The embedding representation for all entities and relations were learned, which are proven to be effective using disease clustering.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The established systematic procedure can efficiently construct a high-quality medical KG from large-scale EMRs. The proposed ranking function PSR achieves the best performance under all relations, and the disease clustering result validates the efficacy of the learned embedding vector as entityâs semantic representation. Moreover, the obtained KG finds many successful applications due to its statistics-based quadruplet.

The major bottleneck being faced currently in these cloud frameworks is their limited scalability and hence inability to cater to the requirements of centralized Internet of Things (IoT) based compute environments.

The new paradigms of fog and edge computing provide innovative solutions by bringing resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing compared to cloud domains.

Furthermore, these tools may allow the model to be easily trained and tested for automated implementation within the plantâs remote surveillance system.
                  To this end, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, and in particular artificial neural network (ANN) models, have been selected in this paper as prediction models, since their structure can be adapted to improve predictions accuracy and they can also learn from dynamic changes in environmental conditions.

In this work, we present a comprehensive series of experimental studies to better understand the asphaltene precipitation, aggregation, and deposition mechanisms. Here, we introduce a simple method to determine the amount of precipitated asphaltene using NIR spectroscopy measurements without the implementation of calibration curves. Moreover, the kinetics of asphaltene precipitation and aggregation is simultaneously investigated by a newly developed, fast, and reliable NIR spectroscopy technique. In the new method, only less than 2â¯ml of sample is required for each experiment. In addition, unlike gravimetric techniques, less time consuming and labor-intensive measurements can be performed. In addition, the temperature can be controlled; hence, experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effects of temperature and the driving force on the kinetics of asphaltene precipitation and aggregation. Subsequently, the quantified precipitated asphaltene amount can be used to calibrate the precipitation and aggregation kinetic parameters of the asphaltene deposition model. The results obtained from the kinetics experiments facilitate in establishing a function to scale the precipitation kinetic parameter from laboratory-scale experiments to real field high-pressure high-temperature conditions. Additionally, a multi-section stainless steel packed bed column is proposed to study asphaltene deposition at high temperature and under dynamic conditions. In these experiments, the amount of deposited asphaltene is directly quantified. The results from the packed bed column deposition tests can be used to calibrate the deposition kinetic parameter of the asphaltene deposition model.",industry

Recently, the deep neural network has become a powerful learning machine, making it possible to work with text itself as raw input for the classification problems. However, existing neural networks are typically end-to-end and lack explicit interpretation of the prediction. In this paper, we propose Jumper, a novel framework that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Generally, Jumper is a neural system that scans a piece of text sequentially and makes classification decisions at the time it wishes, which is inspired by the cognitive process of human text reading. In our framework, both the classification result and when to make the classification are part of the decision process, controlled by a policy network and trained with reinforcement learning. Experimental results of real-world applications demonstrate the following properties of a properly trained Jumper: (1) it tends to make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing total text reading by 30â40% and often finding the key rationale of the prediction; and (2) it achieves classification accuracy better than or comparable to state-of-the-art models in several benchmark and industrial datasets. We further conduct a simulation experiment with mock data, which confirms that Jumper is able to make a decision at the theoretically optimal decision position.",industry

However, digital platforms are, to some extent, abstractions of this model so far. In this paper, a full digital platform to design, implement and run real-time analog-like spiking neural networks is presented. Specifically, we present the design and implementation of digital circuits to run real-time biologically plausible spiking neural networks on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The circuit designed for the neuron implements the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model. The synapsis implemented is a bi-exponential current-based one. The synaptic circuit design consists of one static memory with the baseline current and a dynamic memory which stores the updated contribution over time of each pre-synaptic connection. All the parameters of both the neuron and the synapse are configurable. The results of the circuits are validated by running the same experiments on the Brian simulator. The circuits, which are totally original and independent of the technology, use only 136 slice registers of hardware resources. Thus, these designs allow the scale of the network. These circuits aim to be the basis of the spiking neural networks on digital devices. This platform allows the user to first simulate their network within the Brian simulator and then, confidently, move to the hardware platform replicating the same performance or even replace their analog platform with the digital one.",industry

Data-driven methods to deliver this service are gaining momentum due to developments regarding information and communication technologies. Particularly, fault prediction may be interpreted as a supervised learning classification problem, in which algorithms trained by operational data gathered from the shop-floor are capable of informing managers whether a machine might enter in a failure state or not. Despite the relevance of this approach, implementations are hindered by several challenges. In this work, we review approaches aimed to deal with four of these challenges, namely: limited amount of training data, unbalanced training data sets, uncertainty regarding which variables should be monitored, and uncertainty regarding how exactly historical data should be employed in the algorithmâs training. To deal with training sets with limited size, learning procedures observed to perform well with a lower volume of training data can be used, such as the Random Forests technique. Alternatively, transfer learning techniques can be utilized to adapt models trained in a virtual domain with abundant synthetic data to the real manufacturing system domain. To deal with unbalance among classification classes, cost-sensitive learning methods can be employed to alter the penalties incurred when misclassifications occurs in the minority class. Alternatively, resampling methods can be applied before learning occurs. Lastly, both the decisions regarding which variables to track, and to what extent historical data should be included in the training process, can be addressed through the use of specific feature selection methods.",industry

Despite the successful development, the main limitation of most existing methods lies in the assumption that the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, i.e. the same machine under identical condition. However, this assumption is difficult to be met in the real industries, since the diagnostic model is generally expected to be applied on new machines. In order to address this issue, a deep learning-based cross-machine health identification method is proposed for industrial vacuum pumps, which are of great importance in the manufacturing industry but have received far less research attention in the literature. Generalized diagnostic features can be learnt using the proposed domain adaptation technique with maximum mean discrepancy metric. The health identification model learnt from the training machines can be well applied on new machines. Experiments on a real-world vacuum pump dataset validate the proposed method, which is promising for industrial applications.",industry

The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images.

CDIO approach caters an engineering education that stresses fundamentals set in the context of real-world systems and products. It provides a universal structure for a strong engineering education integrating an entire set of graduate attributes. Developing undergraduate students into successful engineers requires integration of technical knowledge and soft skills.

The structured research-driven approach is provided to monitor and review the implementation of the CDIO principles and standards. It is observed that CDIO provides integrated learning to develop deep learning of technical knowledge whilst simultaneously develops personal, interpersonal, process, product, and system developing skills. The primary outcome of the CDIO is the students are exposed to the work environment used in the industry for the product and process development and the secondary outcome is that it provides a useful tool for devolvement and assessment of the skill set of the students.

However, real life industrial processes are having multiple responses, which are conflicting with each other i.e, if we try to optimize one response we may have to compromise with the other. An attempt to optimize all the responses simultaneously to get all response in their acceptable range is called as Multiresponse Optimization (MRO) problem. This paper proposes an integrated WPCA-ANN-PSO approach to perform MRO of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes. It is a three stage process, in the first stage the multiple responses are converted into a single multiperformance index (MPI) using Taguchi-Weighted Principal Component Analysis (WPCA) approach. In the second stage an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed which is capable of predicting MPI for given set of control factors. Finally, in the third stage Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search the global optimal solution using the developed ANN model. Further, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach a case study on MRO of FSW process was carried-out to join two plates of AA2024-T4 aluminum using tool of HS steel of grade 304. The control factors considered were D/d ratio, tool rotation speed (TRS) and weld speed (WS). The responses considered were ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and hardness of the joint. The experiments were planned as per Taguchi orthogonal array L8. By WPCA approach the optimal parameters were found to be D/d ratio of 3, TRS of 670â¯rpm and WS of 17.

However, whatever ML offers, firms urge to capitalise it for their competitive advantage. Applying ML to real-life construction industry problems goes beyond just prototyping predictive models. It entails intensive activities which, in addition to training robust ML models, provides a comprehensive framework for answering questions asked by construction folks when intelligent solutions are getting deployed at their premises to substitute or facilitate their decision-making tasks.

The impact of a common DP excipient, polysorbate 80, on both the formation and biological consequences of SiOP was also tested. SiOP was found associated with (1) minimal cytokine secretion from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, (2) no response in cell lines that report NF-ÎºB/AP-1 signaling, and (3) no antidrug antibodies or significant cytokine production in transgenic Xeno-het mice, whether or not mAb1 or polysorbate 80 was present. These results suggest that SiOP in mAb1, representative of real-world DP in PFS, poses no increased risk of immunogenicity.",industry

RelPoInt allows users to select a virtual button by pointing to a relative position in a virtual 3D menu. This approach makes use of the distance or angle between the relative point and the reference point. Users can set the reference point freely and operate all the functions on the menu with a simple gesture. Microsoft Kinect was used to implement the RelPoInt in this study. To suggest a radial menu suitable for the RelPoInt, we conducted an experiment in which 20 participants were asked to point to virtual buttons, which were divided into four to eight regions. Errors and subjective assessment of easiness were measured at each treatment condition. RelPoInt can make users to manipulate functions without memorizing complicated gesture vocabularies, which is among the most serious pain points of using a gesture interface. Furthermore, RelPoInt does not require expensive gesture recognition equipment compared with finger recognition interfaces because the required resolution of interaction recognition is less sophisticated. It can be useful in applying 3D gesture interfaces to a variety of devices for smart home, virtual or augmented reality.

The reliability of petroleum artificial lifting systems that use Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP) depends substantially on the performance of these pumps. ESP can operate subjected to severe operating conditions such as viscous and two-phase flow. In recent years, real-time technologies based on machine learning algorithms have gained importance due to the capability to take advantage of historical data for future predictions. The present work proposes a particular assembly of Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for the detection and classification of incipient faults in a pumping system. Experiments were carried out on a ten-stage ESP to simulate, monitor and label the faults. The pump worked at 1800, 2400, 3000 and 3500â¯rpm, with a two-phase liquid-gas mixture.

The failures considered were the unexpected closure of the choke valve, the input pressure decreasing, the fluid viscosity increasing and the gas flow rate increasing.

However, the final validation of the UV-C light as safety feature should be conducted with commercial liquid plasma and using the pig bioassay model. As a first objective, the potential infectivity of a raw liquid plasma product collected from an abattoir was tested by means of a swine bioassay. We used Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), a ubiquitous virus that has been systematically detected by PCR in porcine plasma at abattoirs as selection criteria for commercial liquid plasma lot. As a second aim of the study, the effects of different doses of UV-C irradiation on the selected raw liquid plasma were assayed in the animal bioassay. Moreover, other swine infecting agents, including Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were also determined in the original plasma and monitored in the inoculated animals. Pigs negative for PCV-2 and PRRSV genome and antibodies were allotted to one of five groups (6 to 8 pigs/ group) and injected intra-peritoneally with 10 mL of their assigned inoculum at 50 d of age. Negative control pigs (group 1) were injected with PBS. Positive control pigs (group 5) were injected with a PCV-2 inoculum. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were injected with liquid porcine plasma that had been subjected to 0 (raw plasma), 3000 or 9000 J/L UV-C irradiation, respectively. Group 2 pigs (0 J/L UV-C) got infection by PRRSV but no PCV-2 infection or seroconversion.

Therefore, several researches in the recent years have been proposing to use data-driven models from artificial intelligence field for ROP prediction and optimization.
                  This paper presents an extensive review of the literature on ROP prediction, especially, with machine learning techniques, as well as how these models can be used to optimize the drilling activities. The ROP models are classified as traditional models (based on physics-models), statistical models (e.g. multiple regression), or machine learning methods. This review enables to see that machine learning techniques can potentially outperform in terms of ROP-prediction accuracy on top of traditional or statistical models. Throughout this work, an extensive analysis of different ways of obtaining ROP models is carried out, concluding with different strategies adopted in literature to perform data-driven model optimization.

To overcome these problems, in this study, a novel pilot-scale air-lift multilevel circulation membrane bioreactor (AMCMBR) was used to explore the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN) while treating real ship sewage. Results indicated that the satisfactory removal efficiencies of COD and TN was achieved in the former stages (Re(COD)â¯=â¯91.57% and 87.82%; Re(TN)â¯=â¯77.17% and 81.19%). When HRT decreased to 4â¯h, the removal efficiencies of COD and TN was 86.93% and 70.49% respectively, which still met the strict IMO discharge standards. This mainly because the biofilm-assistant membrane filtration lead to the increase of physical removal rate. The high ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)/mixed liquid suspended solids (MLSS) (i.e. 0.75) indicated a high biomass content in the attached sludge and resulted into perfect pollutants removal effort. The compliance rate of COD and TN was 100% and 89%, respectively, which indicated stable operation of the pilot-scale AMCMBR throughout the whole experiment. Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the abundance of Î²-Proteobacteria was a key microbial reason for TN removal.

The anaerobic digestion process is the industry standard technology for biogas production due to its lowered energy consumption and its reliance on microbiology.

With unsuitable treatment procedure for liquid digestate, the mass of bio-feedstock can potentially escape the circular supply chain within the economy. This paper recommends the implementation of evaporator systems to provide a sustainable liquid digestate treating mechanism within the economy. Studied evaporator systems are represented by vacuum evaporation in combination with ammonia scrubber, stripping and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, complex multi-dimensional decisions should be made by stakeholders before implementing such systems. Our work utilizes a novel techno-economics model to study the techno-economics robustness in implementing recent state-of-art vacuum evaporation systems with exploitation of waste heat from combined heat and power (CHP) units in biogas plants (BGP). To take into the account the stochasticity of the real world and robustness of the analysis, we used the Monte-Carlo simulation technique to generate more than 20,000 of different possibilities for the implementation of the evaporation system. Favourable decision pathways are then selected using a novel methodology which utilizes the artificial neural network and a hyper-optimized decision tree classifier. Two pathways that give the highest probability of providing a fast payback period are identified. Descriptive statistics are also used to analyse the distributions of decision parameters that lead to success in implementing the evaporator system.

However, ALD experiments remain expensive and time-consuming, and the existing first-principles based models have not yet been able to provide solutions to key process outputs that are computationally efficient, which is necessary for on-line optimization and real-time control. In this work, a multiscale data-driven model is proposed and developed to capture the macroscopic process domain dynamics with a linear parameter varying model, and to characterize the microscopic domain film growth dynamics with a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The multiscale data-driven model predicts the transient deposition rate from the following four key process operating parameters that can be manipulated, measured or estimated by process engineers: precursor feed flow rate, operating pressure, surface heating, and transient film coverage. Our results demonstrate that the multiscale data-driven model can efficiently characterize the transient input-output relationship for the SiO2 thermal ALD process using bis(tertiary-butylamino)silane (BTBAS) as the Si precursor. The multiscale data-driven model successfully reduces the computational time from 0.6 to 1.2h for each time step, which is required for the first-principles based multiscale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, to less than 0.1s, making its real-time usage feasible.

The GTs offer high power output along with a high combined cycle efficiency and high fuel flexibility. As consequence, the energy efficiency, the pressure oscillations, the pollutant emissions and the fault diagnosis have become some of the recent concerns related to this type of equipment. In order to solve these GTs related problems and many other real-world engineering and industry 4.0 issues, a set of new technological approaches have been tested, such as the combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and metaheuristics for global optimization. In this paper, the recently proposed metaheuristic denoted Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) is applied to the operation optimization of a heavy duty gas turbine placed in Brazil and used in power generation. The global goal is to find the best valves setup to reduce the fuel consumption while coping with environmental and physical constraints from its operation. In order to treat it as an optimization problem, an integrated simulation model is implemented from original data-driven models and others previously proposed in literature. Moreover, a new version of the COA that links some concepts from Cultural Algorithms (CA) is proposed, which is validated under a set of benchmarks functions from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 and tested to the GT problem. The results show that the proposed Cultural Coyote Optimization Algorithm (CCOA) outperforms its counterpart for benchmark functions. Further, non-parametric statistical significance tests prove that the CCOAâs performance is competitive when compared to other state-of-the-art metaheuristics after a set of experiments for five case studies. In addition, the convergence analysis shows that the cultural mechanism employed in the CCOA has improved the COA balance between exploration and exploitation.

First, based on the offline identified RBF-ARX model without offset term, two convex polytopic sets are constructed to wrap the globally nonlinear behavior of the system. Then, the optimization problem of implementing a quasi-minâmax MPC algorithm including several linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is formulated, and it is solved offline to synthesize a sequence of explicit control laws that correspond to a sequence of asymptotically stable invariant ellipsoids, of which all the optimization results are stored in a look-up table.

However, with NFV comes numerous challenges related mainly to the complexity of deploying and adjusting VNFs in the physical networks, owing to the huge number of nodes and links in today's datacenters, and the inter-dependency among VNFs forming a certain network service. Several contributions have been made in an attempt to answer these challenges, where most of the existing solutions focus on the static placement of VNFs and overlook the dynamic aspect of the problem, which arises mainly due to the ever-changing resource availability in the cloud datacenters and the continuous mobility of the users. Few attempts have been lately made to incorporate the dynamic aspect to the VNF deployment solutions. The main problem of these approaches lies in their reactive readjustment scheme which determines the placement/migration strategy upon the receipt of a new request or the happening of a certain event, thus resulting in high setup latencies. In this paper, we take advantage of machine learning to reduce the complexity of the placement and readjustment processes through designing a cluster-based proactive solution. The solution consists of (1) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that considers a tradeoff between the minimization of the latency, Service-Level Objective (SLO) violation cost, hardware utilization, and VNF readjustment cost, (2) an optimized k-medoids clustering approach which proactively partitions the substrate network into a set of disjoint on-demand clusters and (3) data-driven cluster-based placement and readjustment algorithms that capitalize on machine learning to intelligently eliminate some cost functions from the optimization problem to boost its feasibility in large-scale networks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution considerably reduces the readjustment time and decrease the hardware utilization compared to the K-means, original k-medoids and migration without clustering approaches.",industry

This paper introduces a novel soft sensor for filter cake moisture estimation that uses machine learning algorithms and data collected with basic process instrumentation. The method is primarily based on the cooling effect observed in the cake and air, caused by evaporation of liquid from the cake during the dewatering period, and it can be supported by other process data. The specific energy consumption of vacuum filtration and the subsequent thermal drying to zero moisture is also analyzed. The results of pilot-scale experiments with calcite slurry and a horizontal belt vacuum filter show that in order to minimize the specific energy consumption of vacuum filtration, it is crucial to find the right combination of slurry concentration, vacuum level, and mass of filter cake per unit area. The proposed method for estimating the filter cake moisture content is especially suitable for real-time monitoring and control, enabling also considerable reduction in the energy consumption of the overall process.

Large-scale injection of CO2 into deep reservoirs carries a potential for its undesired leakage into above zones, which can act as an obstacle to its large-scale implementation. Current methods for surveillance of CO2 leaks are costly and not very robust, especially the methods that simulate expected pressure behavior based on an assumed reservoir model.
                  This study proposes a machine learning method for surveillance of fluid leakage using deconvolution response function (a non-linear function of time varying bottomhole pressure and injection rates) from injection and monitoring wells as a measure of leakage that is simulated via multivariate linear regression of all the wells present in the reservoir. Leakage is detected by comparing âexpectedâ (baseline without leaks) deconvolution response of all monitoring wells with their âobservedâ deconvolution response. Three key advantages of the proposed method are that it i) uses only injection rates and bottomhole pressure data (with no reservoir or geological model), ii) is independent of physical process parameterization uncertainties, and iii) applicable to both conventional and unconventional (e.g. fractured tight formations) reservoirs with any fluid (e.g. compressible, incompressible). The proposed method is first trained to learn well history with no leakage, followed by its validation after which it can be used to detect leakage by tracking a meaningful deviation error (at least twenty times the error of no leakage base scenario over same time period) between expected well response and observed well response at all monitoring wells. The well history required for the proposed method comes directly from measurements made at wells in a real field, but in absence of field data the proposed method is illustrated through well history simulated by reservoir simulations; no such numerical simulations are required for application of this method in a real world scenario with well measurements.",industry

In this article, the feasibility of nanoemulsion flooding is investigated as a method for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) through coreflooding experiments, using a packed bed and real reservoir fluids. Nine different mixtures of the solvent, surfactant, and nanoparticles in the form of a nanoemulsion phase are generated and used to recover the oil in the context of an EOR process. Various tests are conducted to determine the properties of porous medium and fluids. To study the production performance of this EOR technique, pressure drop across the packed bed are measured, along with the volumetric measurements of the produced fluids. A baseline injection scheme using seawater is also performed. All the nanoemulsion fluids are synthesized using the same base seawater. The Taguchi experimental design approach is employed in this research to design the experiments. The effects of nanoparticles concentration, along with those of surfactant and solvent components of the injection fluid on the oil recovery at the laboratory scale are investigated using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method. Comparing the performance of waterflooding (WF) and nanoemulsion flooding, enhancement in the Recovery Factor (RF) by using emulsions is between 40â107%. Both the pressure and pressure fluctuations are surprisingly higher in the case of WF in comparison to the emulsion flooding. It is also found that under optimal concentration conditions (0.01â¯g of nanoparticles, 0.015â¯mL of surfactant, and 1â¯mL of solvent per one liter of brine), a recovery factor of up to 60% is achieved.",industry

This type of system is common in a variety of service sectors, such as healthcare, banking, and legal counseling. The majority of the existing literature assumes constant service times or does not consider customer no-shows, which are unrealistic assumptions in many situations. In this paper, we overcome this shortcoming by developing an appointment scheduling model that considers stochastic service times along with customer no-shows for multiple-provider systems with identical providers. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of customersâ waiting time, and providersâ idle time and overtime. We model this problem as a time-inhomogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain process. We use analytical results to reduce the space of optimal schedule candidates, and we employ machine learning techniques to detect patterns among optimal or near-optimal schedules. We then develop an effective heuristic method which provides schedules that perform better than the ones generated by existing models. We test our heuristic both on simulated data and a real-world application. As the real-world application, we collaborate with a local counseling center to implement the schedules suggested by our method. Results from this field experiment reveal an average schedule cost reduction of 16% per day, with a maximum reduction of 40% per day.",industry

Such constraints have been used in prior research where they have been applied to a subpopulation within the training dataset which is of greater interest and importance. In this research we introduce a new setting of regression problems, in which each instance can be assigned a different constraint, defined based on the value of the target (predicted) attribute. The new use of constraints is taken into account and incorporated into the learning process, and is also considered when evaluating the induced model. We propose two algorithms which are modifications to the regression boosting method. There are two advantages of the proposed algorithms: they are not dependent on the base learner used during the learning process, and they can be adopted by any boosting technique. We implemented the algorithms by modifying the gradient boosting trees (GBT) model, and we also introduced two measures for evaluating the models that were trained to solve the constraint problems. We compared the proposed algorithms to three baseline algorithms using four real-life datasets. Due to the algorithmsâ focus on satisfying the constraints, in most cases the results showed significant improvement in the constraint-related measures, with just a minimal effect on the general prediction error. The main impact of the proposed approach is in its ability to derive a model with a higher level of assurance for specific cases of interest (i.e., the constrained cases). This is extremely important and has great significance in various use cases and expert and intelligent systems, particularly critical systems, such as critical healthcare systems (e.g., when predicting blood pressure or blood sugar level), safety systems (e.g., when aiming to estimate the distance of cars or airplanes from other objects), or critical industrial systems (e.g., require to estimate their usability along time). In each of these cases, there is a subpopulation of all instances that is of greater interest to the expert or system, and the sensitivity of the modelâs error changes according to the real value of the predicted feature. For example, for a subpopulation of patients (e.g., patients under the age of eight, or patients known to be at risk), physicians often require a sensitive model that accurately predicts blood pressure values.",industry

Here, the possibility to improve the usual workflow with machine learning algorithms is explored.
                  The whole requirements management process has two major bottlenecks, which can be automatized. The first one, detecting changes, can be accomplished via a document comparison tool. The second one, recognizing the responsibilities and assigning them to the right department, can be solved with standard machine learning algorithms.

Thus, interpersonal influences among workers play a crucial role in forming and affecting construction workers' safety behaviors. The social learning literature indicates that interpersonal learning occurs in two opposing ways â positive reinforcement by demonstrating preferred behaviors, and negative reinforcement by demonstrating negative consequences of inappropriate behaviors. Amid theoretical disagreements in the social learning literature, it remains unclear in the construction safety literature how the two reinforced learning methods affect construction workers in safety training. To fill the gap, a human-subject experiment (nâ¯=â¯126) was conducted to investigate people's social learning behaviors in a hazardous construction situation â walking between two high-rise buildings. The experiment utilizes a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) system with a motion tracking feature. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (no instruction was given), not-falling group (participants observed an avatar demonstrating appropriate walking behaviors), and falling group (participants watched an avatar quickly walking across a plank and falling off). Indicators, including walking time on the plank, walking speed, and gaze movement, were recorded and analyzed to quantify the effects of the two reinforced learning methods. The results indicate that demonstrating information with positive consequences (not-falling group) encourages people to follow the demonstration and maintain normal walking in a hazardous situation. Showing information with negative consequences (falling group) induced participants to walk faster and more irregularly, which further led to more mistakes and unsafe behaviors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VR in safety studies and provides recommendations for better safety training programs.",industry

Since licensed ridesharing car traces are not openly available and may be completely missing in some cities due to legal issues, we turn to transferring knowledge from public transport open data, i.e., taxis and buses, to ridesharing detection among ordinary vehicles. We propose a novel two-stage transfer learning framework, called CoTrans. In Stage 1, we take taxi and bus data as input to learn a random forest (RF) classifier using trajectory features shared by taxis/buses and ridesharing/other cars. Then, we use the RF to label all the candidate cars. In Stage 2, leveraging the subset of high confident labels from the previous stage as input, we further learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for ridesharing detection, and iteratively refine the RF and CNN, as well as the feature set, via a co-training process. Finally, we use the resulting ensemble of the RF and CNN to identify the ridesharing cars in the candidate pool. Experiments on real car, taxi and bus traces show that CoTrans, with no need of a pre-labeled ridesharing dataset, can outperform state-of-the-art transfer learning methods with an accuracy comparable to human labeling.",industry

The traditional methods such as partial least squares regression (PLS), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) can only provide predicted values which have no probabilistic significance. As a sparse probabilistic model, RVM can provide both the predicted value and the corresponding confidence interval (CI). However, the existence of process noises and redundancy will seriously affect the prediction accuracy and the stability of CI. As a new dimension-increment technique, KPCA_IRBF helps to weaken the negative effects of process noises and redundancy by increasing the dimensionality of monitoring features. The fused features obtained by KPCA_IRBF are more sensitive to the change of tool wear. Two different cutting experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of KPCA_IRBF in improving the prediction accuracy and ameliorating the CI of RVM.

Different strategies using boosting ensemble algorithms have shown improved results over the imbalanced classification problem by combining weak learners to produce a single strong learner. In particular, decision trees are often used as base learners in ensemble learning for classification or regression. However, boosting ensemble algorithms sometimes generate a large number of decision trees that could grow too large to be understandable and interpretable. Additionally, the use of weights adds more complexity to the final result.

Then, several morphological characteristics of the molten pool were extracted. By using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the redundancy of these features, the welding speed, the laser power and the two PCA components acted on as the four input neurons, while the two output neurons consisted of the weld waist width (WW) and the weld back width (BW) representing weld seam quality.

Traditional fire detection was done by operators through video cameras in petroleum and chemical facilities. However, it is an unrealistic job for the operator in a large chemical facility to find out the fire in time because there may be hundreds of video cameras installed and the operator may have multiple tasks during his/her shift. With the rapid development of computer vision, intelligent fire detection has received extensive attention from academia and industry. In this paper, we present a novel intelligent fire detection approach through video cameras for preventing fire hazards from going out of control in chemical factories and other high-fire-risk industries. The approach includes three steps: motion detection, fire detection and region classification. At first, moving objects are detected through cameras by a background subtraction method. Then the frame with moving objects is determined by a fire detection model which can output fire regions and their locations. Since false fire regions (some objects similar with fire) may be generated, a region classification model is used to identify whether it is a fire region or not. Once fire appears in any camera, the approach can detect it and output the coordinates of the fire region. Simultaneously, instant messages will be immediately sent to safety supervisors as a fire alarm. The approach can meet the needs of real-time fire detection on the precision and the speed. Its industrial deployment will help detect fire at the very early stage, facilitate the emergency management and therefore significantly contribute to loss prevention.",industry

Most standard approaches to detect and identify cylinders are not robust to outliers (e.g. points on other objects in the scene), which limits their applicability in realistic scenes. In addition, these methods fail to benefit from environmental constraints, e.g. the fact that cylinders often lie or stand on flat surfaces. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, we introduce three main novelties: (i) a point cloud soft voting scheme with curvature information that reduces the influence of outliers and noise, (ii) a selective sampling of the orientation space that favorsorientations known a priori, and (iii) a deep-learning based classifier to filter out objects with non-cylindrical appearance in the 2D images, thus further improving robustness to outliers.

Nucleate boiling heat transfer, for instance, has numerous practical applications, while the film boiling is an undesirable operation regime. So far, most correlations and computer simulations to quantify boiling heat transfer rely on direct measurement of thermohydraulic data, such as heater temperature, which is often invasive. Here it is demonstrated that neural network-based models can quantify heat transfer using only direct and indirect visual information of the boiling phenomenon, without any prior knowledge of the governing equations, which enables the non-intrusive measurement of heat flux based on boiling process imaging. It is shown that neural networks can encode bubble morphology and its correlation with heat flux returning errors as low as 7% when compared with precise experimental measurements, a significant improvement over current prediction methods of boiling heat transfer. Furthermore, it is shown that these systems may be implemented in inexpensive, compact computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, to infer heat flux in real time from visualization.",industry

Industry internet of thing (IIoT), as the extension of IoT in industry, makes the industrial production more intelligent and efficient. Remaining useful life prediction (RUL), as an essential application area of IIoT, plays an increasingly crucial role. In traditional data-based methods, the feature extraction methods depend on the prior knowledge and are separated from the RUL models. Though ensemble learning can be applied to prevent overfitting, the methods about ensemble learning are still separated from the RUL model. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel deep learning network, namely Multi-scale Dense Gate Recurrent Unit Network (MDGRU) is proposed in this paper, which is composed of the feature layers initialized by pre-trained Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) network, multi-scale layers, skip gate recurrent unit layers, dense layers. By adding multi-scale layers and dense layers, the network can capture the sequence features and ensemble different time-scale attention information. Meanwhile it is an end-to-end network combining the feature extraction methods and RUL models only by pre-training the RBM model so it is more convenient for application. Our experiments with real bearings datasets show that proposed MDGRU network is able to achieve higher accuracy compared to other data-driven methods.",industry

Unfortunately, the process often operates under different modes, and labels thereof are often unknown. In practice, labeling for sampled data is expensive and time-consuming, so identifying the operation conditions of the industrial process is difficult. In addition, sampled data from the industrial system are always contaminated by outliers or noise. Therefore, a robust process monitoring method for the multimode process is particularly important and challenging. In this paper, a robust dictionary learning method is proposed for processes with multiple unknown modes. Firstly, by taking the sparsity of outliers into account, a robust dictionary learning method is proposed to identify and remove the outliers and noise in the sampled training data. Secondly, an iterative minimization algorithm is designed for solving the dictionary learning optimization program. Thirdly, based on the sparsity of the sparse code, we partition the sparse code into different clusters via spectral clustering method, and then the dictionary is divided into some sub-dictionaries according to the cluster results of sparse code. Lastly, when a new sample is generated, we reconstruct it under different sub-dictionaries, and the smallest dictionary reconstruction error is calculated as a classifier for process monitoring and fault detection. To evaluate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a numerical simulation, the continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH) process, and an industrial aluminum electrolysis process, in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to provide satisfying monitoring results, and it is also robust to outliers in the sampled training data. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method is an unsupervised learning method, therefore, it is more suitable for the process monitoring of real industrial systems.",industry

In response, the field of Asset Management has moved from fleet-wide failure models to individualised asset prognostics. Individualised models are seldom truly distributed, and often fail to capitalise the processing power of the asset fleet. This leads to hardly scalable machine learning centralised models that often must find a compromise between accuracy and computational power. In order to overcome this, we present a novel theoretical approach to collaborative prognostics within the Social Internet of Things. We introduce the concept of Social Asset Networks, defined as networks of cooperating assets with sensing, communicating and computing capabilities. In the proposed approach, the information obtained from the medium by means of sensors is synthesised into a Health Indicator, which determines the state of the asset. The Health Indicator of each asset evolves according to an equation determined by a triplet of parameters. Assets are given the form of the equation but they ignore their parametric values. To obtain these values, assets use the equation in order to perform a non-linear least squares fit of their Health Indicator data. Using these estimated parameters, they are interconnected to a subset of collaborating assets by means of a similarity metric. We show how by simply interchanging their estimates, networked assets are able to precisely determine their Health Indicator dynamics and reduce maintenance costs. This is done in real time, with no centralised library, and without the need for extensive historical data. We compare Social Asset Networks with the typical self-learning and fleet-wide approaches, and show that Social Asset Networks have a faster convergence and lower cost. This study serves as a conceptual proof for the potential of collaborative prognostics for solving maintenance problems, and can be used to justify the implementation of such a system in a real industrial fleet.",industry

Measurement and verification (M&V) is required to verify the performance of every ECM to ensure its successful implementation and operation. The methodologies implemented to achieve this are currently evolving to a more dynamic state, known as measurement and verification 2.0, through the use of automated and advanced analytics. The primary barrier to the adoption of M&V 2.0 practices are the tools available to practitioners. This paper aims to populate the knowledge gap in the industrial buildings sector by presenting a novel cloud computing-based application, IntelliMaV, that applies advanced machine learning techniques on large datasets to automatically verify the performance of ECMs in near real-time. Additionally, a performance deviation detection system is incorporated, ensuring persistence of savings beyond the typical period of analysis in M&V.
                  IntelliMaV allows M&V practitioners to quantify energy savings with minimum levels of uncertainty by applying powerful analytics to data readily available in industrial facilities. The use of a cloud computing-based architecture reduces the resources required on-site and decreases the time required to train the baseline energy model through the use of parallel processing. The robust nature of the application ensures it is applicable across the broad spectrum of ECMs in the industrial buildings sector. A case study carried out in a large biomedical manufacturing facility demonstrates the ease of use of the application and the benefits realised through its adoption.

This paper presents a four-step methodological framework for the effective data management of SHM systems of OWTs and illustrates its applicability in real-time continuous data collected from three operational units, with the aim of utilising more complete and accurate datasets for fatigue life assessment of support structures. Firstly, a time-efficient synchronisation method that enables the continuous monitoring of these systems is presented, followed by a novel approach to noise cleansing and the posterior missing data imputation (MDI). By the implementation of these techniques those data-points containing excessive noise are removed from the dataset (Step 2), advanced numerical tools are employed to regenerate missing data (Step 3) and fatigue is estimated for the results of these two methodologies (Step 4). Results show that after cleansing, missing data can be imputed with an average absolute error of 2.1%, while this error is kept within the [+ 15.2%â11.0%] range in 95% of cases. Furthermore, only 0.15% of the imputed data fell outside the noise thresholds. Fatigue is found to be underestimated both, when data cleansing does not take place and when it takes place but MDI does not. This makes this novel methodology an enhancement to conventional structural integrity assessment techniques that do not employ continuous datasets in their analyses.",industry

Quantitative lithofacies modeling involves detection and recognition of underlying subsurface rockâs lithofacies.

The real-time well-logs data collected from the sensor-based tools suffer from complications such as noise, nonlinearity, imbalance, and high-dimensionality which makes the prediction task more challenging. The existing literature on quantitative lithofacies modeling includes several data-driven techniques ranging from conventional well-logs to artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, multiple classifiers based Ensemble learners have been found to be more robust and reliable paradigms for detection and identification tasks in various machine learning applications, however, these are not well embraced in the petroleum industry. Ensemble methodology combines diverse expertâs opinions to obtain overall ensemble decision which in turn reduces the risk of a wrong decision. Thus, the uncertainties associated with complex reservoir data can be better handled by the use of Ensemble learners than the existing single learner based conventional models.

New proposed methodologies include active learning activities using a new multipurpose experimental test bed that was developed with industrial components. The renovated graduate-level control engineering related courses include: Continuous Processes, Discrete Processes, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, Linear Control, Nonlinear Control, and Optimal Estimation. The new experimental station was developed for teaching, research, and industrial training activities for the School of Engineering at the UPB. In this work, we report the use of the station in an Optimal Estimation course to replace a traditional homework/exams evaluation approach with an applied work that required independent study, the implementation of different observers in a real lab-scale industrial plant, and a paper-style written report. Increasing independent study activities resulted in academic discussions that are valuable for the learning process of the student. The use of the experimental station and the real comparison of estimation algorithms, implemented by using industrial controllers and high-level programming environments, provided the student skills that cannot be acquired by using only simulations in which real implementation restrictions/challenges do not appear. This work represents one of the first approaches for the implementation of the new curriculum model at the UPB for graduate education.

Manufacturing workers thus need to frequently learn new methods and skills. In fast changing, largely uncertain production systems, manufacturers with the ability to comprehend workersâ behavior and assess their operation performance in near real-time will achieve better performance than peers. Action recognition can serve this purpose. Despite that human action recognition has been an active field of study in machine learning, limited work has been done for recognizing worker actions in performing manufacturing tasks that involve complex, intricate operations. Using data captured by one sensor or a single type of sensor to recognize those actions lacks reliability. The limitation can be surpassed by sensor fusion at data, feature, and decision levels. This paper presents a study that developed a multimodal sensor system and used sensor fusion methods to enhance the reliability of action recognition. One step in assembling a Bukito 3D printer, which composed of a sequence of 7 actions, was used to illustrate and assess the proposed method. Two wearable sensors namely Myo-armband captured both Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and electromyography (EMG) signals of assembly workers. Microsoft Kinect, a vision based sensor, simultaneously tracked predefined skeleton joints of them. The collected IMU, EMG, and skeleton data were respectively used to train five individual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

Similarly, 28 day administration of the effluent showed significant decrease in cardiac Na+-K+-ATPase activity (p<0.05) at concentrations 10% and above, in a concentration dependent manner. However, there was insignificant decrease in cardiac Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity of the exposed mice, when compared with the control group. This study provides novel information on the cardiotoxic effects of oral exposure to untreated pharmaceutical effluent, showing reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity and decreseased myocardial atrophy.

By exploiting the robot code structure, robot actions are converted to event streams that are abstracted into operations. We then demonstrate the applicability of the resulting operations, by visualizing the ongoing process in real-time as Gantt charts, that support the operators performing maintenance.

To predict the probability of these undesirable phenomena, engineers study the mechanical rock properties of the formation such as Young's modulus, Bulk modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio. Conventionally, these are measured indirectly using the established petro physical relationships from sonic wave velocities which can be obtained from sonic well logs. Unfortunately, reliable sonic well logs are not always available, due to poor borehole conditions (wash out), damaged tools and offset well data. Most offset well log data are not acquired with dipole sonic tools; they are acquired with a borehole compensated logging tool. This limits the application of acoustic measurements to estimate the mechanical rock properties.

The results of the validation show that the model presented in this study can be used to determine the sanding potential of the formation without performing a compressive geoscientific analysis in the absence of sonic well logs. The developed model's effectiveness is tested by comparing the predicted results with results obtained from the measured well log.

Even if the ECT technique provides low resolution reconstructions, it is cheap, robust and very fast when compared to other imaging tools. In this method one or more rings of electrodes excite a medium to be imaged at high frequencies, and more particularly at frequencies for which a static electrical potential field has fully developed. In many studies of other research groups only one ring of sources is introduced but the reconstruction accuracy was not totally satisfactory due to the 3D nature of the problem to be solved. Instead of using nonlinear stochastic algorithms like the simulated annealing (SA) technique that we optimized in previous studies to image permittivity distributions of granular or solid materials as well as real oilâgas or two-phase flows in 2D cylindrical vessel configurations, we propose here a new ECT inversion tool to image permittivities in a 3D cylindrical configuration. 3D stochastic optimization methods such as SA, neural networks, genetic algorithms can become computationally too prohibitive, and classical local or linear inversion methods excessively smooth images in many cases. Therefore, we propose here a 3D parallel inversion procedure with different numbers of rings and different

Are the OHS consequences of Industry 4.0 being evaluated properly? Do we stand to lose any of the gains made through proactive approaches? Are there rational grounds for major concerns? In this article, we examine these questions in order to raise consciousness with regard to the integration of OHS into Industry4.0.
                  It is clear that if the technologies driving Industry 4.0 develop in silos and manufacturersâ initiatives are isolated and fragmented, the dangers will multiply and the net impact on OHS will be negative. As major changes are implemented, previous gains in preventive management of workplace health and safety will be at risk.

Two key parameters are linked to these vibrations: the depth of cut achievable without vibrations and the chatter frequency. Both parameters are linked to the dynamics of machine component excitation and the milling operation parameters. Their identification in any cutting direction in milling machine operations requires complex analytical models and mechatronic simulations, usually only applied to identify the worst cutting conditions in operating machines. This work proposes the use of machine learning techniques with no need to calculate the two above-mentioned parameters by means of a 3-step strategy. The strategy combines: 1) experimental frequency responses collected at the tool center point; 2) analytical calculations of both parameters; and, 3) different machine learning techniques. The results of these calculations can then be used to predict chatter under different combinations of milling directions and machine positions. This strategy is validated with real experiments on a bridge milling machine performing concordance roughing operations on AISI 1045 steel with a 125â¯mm diameter mill fitted with nine cutters at 45Â°, the results of which have confirmed the high variability of both parameters along the working volume. The following regression techniques are tested: artificial neural networks, regression trees and Random Forest. The results show that Random Forest ensembles provided the highest accuracy with a statistical advantage over the other machine learning models; they achieved a final accuracy of 0.95â¯mm for the critical depth and 7.3â¯Hz for the chatter frequency (RMSE) in the whole working volume and in all feed directions, applying a 10â¯Ãâ¯10 cross validation scheme. These RMSE values are acceptable from the industrial point of view, taking into account that the critical depth of this range varies between 0.68â¯mm and 19.20â¯mm and the chatter frequency between 1.14â¯Hz and 65.25â¯Hz. Besides, Random Forest ensembles are more easily optimized than artificial neural networks (1 parameter configuration versus 210 MLPs). Additionally, tools that incorporate regression trees are interesting and highly accurate, providing immediately accessible and useful information in visual formats on critical machine performance for the design engineer.",industry

It is very important to keep track and diagnose the source location(s) and notify the plant manager and emergency responders promptly to alleviate secondary and tertiary damages, improving the effectiveness of emergency responses. In this study, we propose an emergency response system that can cope with leak accidents of a chemical plant by monitoring sensor data and track down the suspected leak source using machine learning: Deep-learning and Random Forest classifiers. It is also difficult to get enough chemical leak accident scenario data or perform actual leak experiments on real plants due to high risk and cost factors. Consequently, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to derive fence monitoring data for chemical leak accident scenarios. These data are to train the machine learning models to predict leak source locations. Six time-series Deep Neural Network (DNN) structures and three Random Forest (RF) structures are trained using CFD dispersion simulation results for 640 leak accident scenarios of a real chemical plant, divided as training and test datasets. As a result, on DNN model using 25 hidden layers and on RF model using 100 decision trees, 75.43% and 86.33% prediction accuracy are achieved, respectively, classifying the most probable leak source out of 40 potential leak source locations. Analyzing the predicted leak source locations that are wrongly classified, those predicted leak sources are also quite adjacent to the actual leak location and hardly called as misclassifications. Considering the superb performance of DNN and RF classifiers for chemical leak tracking, the proposed method would be very useful for chemical emergency management and is highly recommended for real-time diagnosis of the chemical leak sources.",industry

In real industries, the collected machinery signals are usually exposed to environmental noises, and the bearing operating condition changes in different working scenarios. That leads to distribution discrepancy between the labeled training data and the unlabeled testing data, and consequently the diagnosis performance deteriorates. This paper proposes a novel deep distance metric learning method for rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on deep learning. A deep convolutional neural network is used as the main architecture. Based on the learned representations through multiple hidden layers, a representation clustering algorithm is proposed to minimize the distance of intra-class variations and maximize the distance of inter-class variations simultaneously. A domain adaptation method is adopted to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy between training and testing data. In this way, the robustness of the fault diagnosis method can be significantly improved against noise and variation of working condition. Extensive experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the diagnosis performance is widely evaluated in different scenarios. Comparisons with other approaches and the related works on the same dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results of this study suggest the proposed deep distance metric learning method offers a new and promising tool for intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.",industry

In May 2014, clinical samples received from a broiler breeder chicken premises that had been experiencing health and production problems for approximately one week tested positive by avian influenza (AI) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). Following immediate escalation to an official, statutory investigation to rule out the presence of notifiable AI virus (AIV; H5 or H7 subtypes), a non-notifiable H4N6 low pathogenicity (LP) AIV was detected through virus isolation in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) fowlsâ eggs, neuraminidase inhibition test, cleavage site sequencing and AIV subtype H4-specific serology. Premises movement restrictions were lifted, and no further disease control measures were implemented as per the United Kingdom (UK) legislation. Phylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the virus revealed closest relationships to viruses from Mallard ducks in Sweden during 2007 and 2009. In June 2014, clinical suspicion of NAD was reported in a flock of free-range laying chickens elsewhere in GB, due to increasing daily mortality and reduced egg production over a five-day period. An H4N6 LPAIV with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0.50 was isolated. This virus was genetically highly similar, but not identical, to the virus detected during May 2014. Full viral genome analyses showed characteristics of a strain that had not recently transferred from wild birds, implying spread within the poultry sector had occurred. A stalk deletion in the neuraminidase gene sequence indicated an adaptation of the virus to poultry. Furthermore, there was unexpected evidence of systemic spread of the virus on post-mortem. No other cases were reported. Infection with LPAIVs often result in variable clinical presentation in poultry, making detection of disease more difficult.",industry

These objectives are often non-commensurable and competing. For example, material handling is a vital element of industrial processes, which involves a variety of operations including the movement, storage and control of materials throughout the processes of manufacturing, distribution, and disposal while having to satisfy multiple objectives. Having an efficient and effective material handling system (MHS) is of great importance to various industries, such as manufacturing and logistics industries, for maintaining and facilitating a continuous flow of materials through the workplace and guaranteeing that required materials are available when needed. In this paper, a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm largely based on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is applied to simulation-based optimization of material handling system. This proposed algorithm hybridizes the AIS with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) by incorporating the crossover operator derived from the biological evolution. The reason behind such hybridization is to further enhance the diversity of the clone population and the convergence of the algorithm.

The highest PM concentrations were reached in the classroom. Simulations showed that heavy intensity outdoor activities played a major role in PM deposition, especially in the upper part of the respiratory tract.

As a comparison, O3/Fe2+ oxidation process was proved to be more effective than other processes (e.g. O3-Fe2+, O3/H2O2/Fe2+, O3/H2O2-Fe2+), and the final effluent Ni2+ concentration could satisfied the discharge standard (<0.1â¯mgâ¯Lâ1, China) under the optimal conditions (H2O2 dosage of 1.0â¯mLâ¯Lâ1, Fe2+: H2O2 mole ratio of 1.46, and reaction time of 10â¯min for Fenton reaction, initial influent pH of 3.0, O3 dosage of 252â¯mgâ¯Lâ1, Fe2+ of 150â¯mgâ¯Lâ1, and reaction time of 30â¯min for O3/Fe2+ oxidation). Furthermore, pilot-scale test was carried out to study the practical treatability towards the real nickel plating effluent, revealing the effective removal of some other co-existence contaminations. And Fenton reaction has contributed most, with the percentage ranging from 72.41% to 93.76%. The economic cost advantage made it a promising alternative to the continuous Fenton oxidation.",industry

The purpose of this work is to present the recent results that we have obtained on a new job board recommendation system that is a decision-making tool intended to guide recruiters while they are posting a job on the Internet. Firstly, the Doc2Vec embedded representation is used to analyse the textual content of the job offers, then the job applicant clickstreams history on various job boards are stored in a large learning database, and then represented as time series. Secondly, a deep neural network architecture is used to predict future values of the clicks on the job boards. Third, and in parallel, dimensionality reduction techniques are used to transform the clicks numerical time series into temporal symbolic sequences. Forecasting algorithms are then used to predict future symbols for each sequence. Finally, a list of top ranked job boards are kept by maximizing the clickstreams forecasting in both representations. Our experiments are tested on a real dataset, coming from a job-posting database of an industrial partner.

Works-in-process are assembled into end-products by following an identical processing route. When a worker at a particular stage repeatedly handles similar tasks and gains the knowledge to execute a task efficiently, the processing time for later tasks is shortened significantly. This assembly process can be described as the flow shop learning effect scheduling problem with release dates, in which the learning effect is dependent on position. The objective is to minimize one of three different criteria, namely, makespan, total completion time and total quadratic completion time. This scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. For small-scale problems, a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm with an efficient branching rule is proposed to obtain optimal solutions. The MIP model and the B&B algorithm provide key evidence for academic research. For large-scale problems, the asymptotic optimality of a class of shortest processing time available (SPTA)-based heuristics is proven in terms of probability limit. The convergence property indicates that an SPTA-based heuristic can serve as an optimal schedule under the industrial setting, where thousands of tasks are typically executed on a set of machines.

However, while many experiments have been carried out on these engines to demonstrate their advantages, very few studies have focused on the corresponding airâfuel ratio (AFR) control strategy. In order to achieve stable engine operation, it is essential to maintain transient AFR during the change of fuel blend ratio. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive controller for AFR control of dual-injection engines. The proposed controller is designed based on a recently developed machine learning method called extreme learning machine, and its stability is verified with Lyapunov analysis. Simulations have been performed on an industry-level engine simulation software to verify the controller. Since dual-injection engines are not available in the market, a spark-ignition engine has been retrofitted for dual-injection operation so that the proposed controller can be implemented and evaluated experimentally. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed controller can effectively regulate the AFR to desired level. The results also show that the proposed controller outperforms the engine built-in AFR controller, indicating its significance for dual-injection engines.",industry

However, relatively little is known about the disease on a virological and epidemiological level and its consequences for humans. Accordingly, a large demand for in vitro derived Brazilian ZIKV material to support in vitro and in vivo studies has arisen. However, a prompt supply of ZIKV and ZIKV antigens cannot be guaranteed as the production of this virus typically using Vero or C6/36 cell lines remains challenging.
                  Here we present a production platform based on BHK-21 suspension (BHK-21SUS) cells to propagate Brazilian ZIKV at larger quantities in perfusion bioreactors. Scouting experiments performed in tissue culture flasks using adherent BHK-21 and Vero cells have demonstrated similar permissivity and virus yields for four different Brazilian ZIKV isolates. The cell-specific yield of infectious virus particles varied between respective virus strains (1â48PFU/cell), and the ZIKV isolate from the Brazilian state Pernambuco (ZIKVPE) showed to be a best performing isolate for both cell lines. However, infection studies of BHK-21SUS cells with ZIKVPE in shake flasks resulted in poor virus replication, with a maximum titer of 8.9Ã103

Learning from narratives is the preferred option to transfer lessons learned knowledge. However, learners with insufficient prior knowledge often experience difficulties in grasping the right information from narratives. This paper introduces an approach that uses narrative maps to represent lessons learned knowledge to help learners understand narratives. Since narrative mapping is a time-consuming, labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive process, the proposed approach is supported by a computational narrative mapping (CNM) method to automate the process. CNM incorporates advanced technologies, such as computational linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI), to identify and extract critical narrative elements from an unstructured, text-based narrative and organize them into a structured narrative map representation. This research uses a case study conducted in the construction industry to evaluate CNM performance in comparison with existing paragraph and concept mapping approaches. Among the results, over 90% of respondents asserted that CNM enhanced their understanding of the lessons learned. CNMâs performance in identifying and extracting narrative elements was evaluated through an experiment using real-life narratives from a reminiscence study.

Unsafe conditions and behaviors are considered as the major causes of construction accidents. The current safety inspection of conditions and behaviors heavily rely on human efforts which are limited onsite. To improve the safety performance of the industry, a more efficient approach to identify the unsafe conditions on site is required to supplement the current manual inspection practice. A promising way to supplement the current manual safety inspection is automated and intelligent monitoring/inspection through information and sensing technologies, including localization techniques, environment monitoring, image processing and etc. To assess the potential benefits of contemporary technologies for onsite safety inspection, the authors focused on real-time guardrail detection, as unprotected edges are the ones cause for workers falling from heights.

An augmented data set is generated with the addition of background image to guardrail 3D models and used as training set.

One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time-varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",industry

Various applications of AI in everyday life include machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics, data processing and analysis, etc. The oil and gas industry is not behind either, in fact, AI techniques have recently been applied to estimate PVT properties, optimize production, predict recoverable hydrocarbons, optimize well placement using pattern recognition, optimize hydraulic fracture design, and to aid in reservoir characterization efforts. In this study, three different AI models are trained and used to forecast hydrocarbon production from hydraulically fractured wells. Two vastly used artificial intelligence methods, namely the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are compared to a traditional curve fitting method known as Response Surface Model (RSM) using second order polynomial equations to determine production from shales. The objective of this work is to further explore the potential of AI in the oil and gas industry. Eight parameters are considered as input factors to build the model: reservoir permeability, initial dissolved gas-oil ratio, rock compressibility, gas relative permeability, slope of gas oil ratio, initial reservoir pressure, flowing bottom hole pressure, and hydraulic fracture spacing. The range of values used for these parameters resemble real field scenarios from prolific shale plays such as the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and the Niobrara in the United States. Production data consists of oil recovery factor and produced gas-oil ratio (GOR) generated from a generic hydraulically fractured reservoir model using a commercial simulator. TheÂ Box-Behnken experiment design was used to minimize the number of simulations for this study. Five time-based models (for production periods of 90 days, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years) and one rate-based model (when oil rate drops to 5 bbl/day/fracture) were considered. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) routine is used in all three surrogate models to obtain the associated model parameters. Models were trained using 80% of all data generated through simulation while 20% was used for testing of the models. All models were evaluated by measuring the goodness of fit through the coefficient of determination (R2) and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Results show that RSM and LSSVM have very accurate oil recovery forecasting capabilities while LSSVM shows the best performance for complex GOR behavior.

Such systems implement suitable strategies based on the measure of several quantities, among which the relative velocity of the wheels respect to the vehicle body with the aim of regulating in real-time the damping forces. The actual effectiveness of such strategy strongly depends on the reliability and accuracy of the data measured by the sensors involved in the control loop. Due to their simplicity and good performance in terms of linearity, the most used sensors for suspension displacement measurements are based on linear potentiometers but such kind of sensors suffer of wear and tear and aging higher than the other sensors involved in the control loop strategy. As a consequence, the fault detection of such sensor is strongly recommended to avoid wrong and in some cases dangerous suspension behaviors.
                  To this aim, in this paper a Fault Detection scheme for the rear suspension stroke sensor is designed and verified. The residual generation is based on the use of a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) network which is able to effectively take into account for the system nonlinearity. Experimental results have proven the good promptness and reliability of the scheme in detecting different kind of faults as âun-calibration faultsâ (e.g. due to slight variations of the input/output sensor curve), âhold-faultsâ (e.g. due to the breaking of the potentiometer cursor), âopen circuitâ and âshort circuitâ (e.g. due to electrical interruptions and short circuits, respectively).

Recent industrial surveys on the reliability of power electronic systems shows that most of faults occur due to the wear out of aluminum electrolytic capacitors and thermal stress is the major cause for its parametric degradation. The condition of target capacitors can be estimated by monitoring variation in equivalent series resistance (ESR) from the initial pristine state value. ANN is used to estimate ESR of pristine and weak target capacitors at the test conditions. The data set for training and testing of proposed back-propagation trained artificial neural network are experimentally obtained from the developed test bed. Using the test bed, target capacitors are subjected to different operating frequency and temperature in the output section of DC/DC buck converter circuit to determine the effect of variation in electrical and thermal stress on ESR value. After off-line training, the proposed ANN is implemented using National Instruments LabVIEW software.

The transition samples required for learning high performance control can be collected by interacting with the process either by online exploiting the current iteration controller (or policy) under an Îµ-greedy exploration strategy, or by using data collected under any other controller that is capable of ensuring efficient exploration of the action-state space.

However, the basic AANN often suffers from âsmearing effectsâ problems that may lead to misdiagnosis, particularly with regards to the complex faults involving multiple variables. In this work, a new reconstruction-based AANN (RBAANN) method is proposed to enhance the capacity of fault diagnosis. In RBAANN, a generic derivative equation is developed to investigate the effects of AANN model inputs on the prediction error between model inputs and outputs. Based on the derivative equation, the reconstruction-based index for single or multiple variables, which is defined as the minimum prediction error, is obtained by tuning the corresponding model inputs iteratively. However, without the prior knowledge of the real faulty variables, all the possible variable sets need to be evaluated by the reconstruction-based index, and this may result in an exhaustive search and cause a huge computational burden. Thus, a branch and bound algorithm is introduced into RBAANN to solve the variable selection problem. Finally, an efficient fault diagnosis strategy by integrating RBAANN and branch and bound algorithm (BAB-RBAANN) is implemented to further pinpoint the source of the detected faults. This BAB-RBAANN method can handle both single and multiple variable(s) faults for nonlinear systems without prior knowledge efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated on a validation example and an industrial example. Comparisons with other methods, including principal component analysis techniques, are also presented.",industry

Practical applications include the order and duration of investors purchasing stocks and portfolio management.

The combination of process knowledge from task-oriented application programming and information about available workpieces from automated image processing enables a plausibility check and verification of the robot program before execution.

Model-based control methods rely on accurate models of the process to be effective. However, such models may be laborious to obtain and, even when available, the optimization problem underlying the online control problem may be too computationally demanding. Furthermore, the process degradation with time imposes that the model should be periodically updated to stay reliable. One way to address these drawbacks is through the merging of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the classical process control framework. In this work, a methodology to tackle the control of nonlinear chemical processes with RL techniques is proposed and tested on the wellknown benchmark problem of the non-isothermal CSTR with the Van de Vusse reaction. The controller proposed herein is based on the implementation of a policy that associates each state of the process to a certain control action. This policy is directly deduced from a measure of the expected performance gain, given by a value function dependent on the states and actions. In other words, in a given state, the action that provides the highest expected performance gain is chosen and implemented. The value function is approximated by a neural network that can be trained with pre-simulated data and adapted online with the continuous inclusion of new process data through the implementation of an RL algorithm. The results show that the proposed adaptive RLbased controller successfully manages to control and optimize the Van de Vusse reactor against unmeasured disturbances.",industry

The objective is to maximize the expected profit by deciding on the optimal numbers of workers in various knowledge levels to fulfill both production and training requirement. As taking an action affects next periodsâ decisions, the main problem is to find the optimal hiring policy of non-skilled workers in long-time horizon.

Thus, changes may deteriorate the constructed control policy over time, which requires permanent adaptation strategies. Changes usually appear as an evolution in the relationship between instance variables composing stream data, known in machine learning under the term concept drift. Several adaptation strategies have been performed to tackle concept drifting data streams, always assuming that arrived instances are labeled, either completely or partially. However, this assumption is violated in many application areas, especially in the manufacturing field. We propose, in this paper, a new framework called Labeling Extraction from the current Model (LEM). LEM is adapted to retrieve learning labels, relying uniquely on unlabeled received instances and without any external supervision, which has never been previously addressed. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no effort addressing scheduling manufacturing problems for adaptation to data streams with concept drifts. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of LEM. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of LEM to maintain the stability and efficiency of the control policy approximated by the learning model, by significantly improving its prediction performance, compared to its use without adaptation.",industry

Soil classification aids farmers in deciding the type of crop to be sown for a particular type of soil. Similarly, wheat variety classification assists in selecting the right type of wheat for a particular product. Current methods used for classifying agricultural data are mostly manual. These methods involve agriculture field visits and surveys and are labor-intensive, expensive, and prone to human error. Recently, data mining techniques such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) have been used in classification of agricultural data such as soil, crops, and land cover. The resulting classification aid the decision making process of government organizations and agro-industries in the field of agriculture. SVM is a popular approach for data classification. A recent study on SVM highlighted the fact that using multiple kernels instead of a single kernel would lead to better performance because of the greater learning and generalization power. In this work, a hybrid kernel based support vector machine (H-SVM) is proposed for classifying multi-class agricultural datasets having continuous attributes. Genetic algorithm (GA) or gradient descent (GD) methods are utilized to select the SVM parameters C and Î³. The proposed kernel is called the quadratic-radial-basis-function kernel (QRK) and it combines both quadratic and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The proposed classifier has the ability to classify all kinds of multi-class agricultural datasets with continuous features.

In present study, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) method was applied to analyze the global protein alteration of H. parasuis in response to 16Î¼g/mL Emodin. In total, 338 proteins exhibiting significant differential expressions were identified. It was speculated that, through application of bioinformatics analysis to theses differentially expressed proteins, Emodin mainly inhibited some key proteins expression of ABC transport system, carbohydrate metabolism pathway and bacterial cell division by inhibiting the ribosome synthesis, resulting in the growth inhibition of H. parasuis. Remarkably, nine virulence-associated proteins were detected differently expressed, further experiments revealed that after treatment with Emodin, H. parasuis could be inhibited to adhere to and invade into porcine kidney epithelial cells (PK-15 line) and exhibited increased sensitivity to serum complement in a concentration-dependent manner. Phagocytosis assay showed Emodin also could enhance phagocytic activity of porcine alveolar macrophages PAM to H. parasuis.

                  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), when deployed for operation, are inherently prone to uncertainty. Considering their applications in critical domains (e.g., healthcare), it is important that such CPSs are tested sufficiently, with the explicit consideration of uncertainty. Model-based testing (MBT) involves creating test ready models capturing the expected behavior of a CPS and its operating environment. These test ready models are then used for generating executable test cases. It is, therefore, necessary to develop methods that can continuously evolve, based on real operational data collected during the operation of CPSs, test ready models and uncertainty captured in them, all together termed as Belief Test Ready Models (BMs)
               
                  Objective
                  Our objective is to propose a model evolution framework that can interactively improve the quality of BMs, based on operational data. Such BMs are developed by one or more test modelers (belief agents) with their assumptions about the expected behavior of a CPS, its expected physical environment, and potential future deployments. Thus, these models explicitly contain subjective uncertainty of the test modelers.
               
                  Method
                  We propose a framework (named as UncerTolve) for interactively evolving BMs (specified with extended UML notations) of CPSs with subjective uncertainty developed by test modelers. The key inputs of UncerTolve include initial BMs of CPSs with known subjective uncertainty and real data collected from the operation of CPSs. UncerTolve has three key features: 1) Validating the syntactic correctness and conformance of BMs against real operational data via model execution, 2) Evolving objective uncertainty measurements of BMs via model execution, and 3) Evolving state invariants (modeling test oracles) and guards of transitions (modeling constraints for test data generation) of BMs with a machine learning technique.
               
                  Results
                  As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated UncerTolve with one industrial CPS case study, i.e., GeoSports from the healthcare domain. Using UncerTolve, we managed to evolve 51% of belief elements, 18% of states, and 21% of transitions as compared to the initial BM developed in an industrial setting.
               
                  Conclusion
                  
                     UncerTolve can successfully evolve model elements of the initial BM, in addition to objective uncertainty measurements using real operational data. The evolved model can be used to generate additional test cases covering evolved model elements and objective uncertainty. These additional test cases can be used to test the current and future deployments of a CPS to ensure that it will handle uncertainty gracefully during its operations.",industry

In most cases they are only used for static routes to always deliver the same material to the same stations. However, in the context of Industry 4.0, milkrun logistic also has become very popular for use cases where different materials have to be delivered to different stations in little time, so routes cannot be planned in advance anymore. As loading and unloading the milkrun requires a significant amount of time, beside the routing problem itself, both driving and loading times have to be taken into account. Especially in scenarios where high flexibility is required those times will vary significantly and thus are a crucial factor for obtaining the optimal solution. Although containing stochastic components, those times can be predicted by considering the optimal point of time for delivery. In consequence, the best tradeoff between short routes and optimal delivery times is in favor of the shortest route. To solve this optimization problem a biology-inspired method â the ant colony optimization algorithm â has been enhanced to obtain the best solution regarding the above-mentioned aspects. A manufacturing scenario was used to prove the ability of the algorithm in real world problems. It also demonstrates the ability to adapt to changes in manufacturing systems very quickly by dynamically modelling and simulating the processes in intralogistics.

Support vector machine regression (SVR), a computational intelligence technique, has been very successful in the estimation of permeability and has been widely deployed due to its unique features. However, careful selection of SVR hyper-parameters is highly essential to its optimum performance and this task is traditionally done using trial and error approach (TE-SVR) which takes a lot of time and do not guarantee optimal selection of the hyper-parameters. In this work, the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, a heuristic optimization technique, is investigated for the optimal selection of SVR hyper-parameters for the first time in modelling and characterization of hydrocarbon reservoir. The technique is capable of automatic selection of the optimum combination of SVR hyper-parameters resulting in higher predictive accuracy and generalization ability of the developed model. The resulting PSO-SVR model is compared to SVR models whose parameters are obtained through random search (RAND-SVR) and trial and error approach (TE-SVR). The comparison is done using real-life industrial datasets obtained during petroleum exploration from four distinct oil wells located in a Middle Eastern oil and gas field. Simulation results indicate that the PSO-SVR model outperforms all the other models. Error reduction of 15.1%, 26.15%, 12.32% and 7.1% are recorded for PSO-SVR model compared to ordinary SVR (TE-SVR) in well-A, well-B, well-C and well-D, respectively. Also, reduction of 12.8%, 23.97%, 2.51% and 0.11 are recorded when PSO-SVR and RAND-SVR results are compared in the respective wells. Furthermore, the results show the potential of the application of heuristics algorithms, such as PSO, in the optimization of computational intelligence techniques employed in hydrocarbon reservoir characterizations. Therefore, PSO technique is proposed for the optimization of SVR hyper-parameters in permeability prediction and reservoir characterization based on its superior performance over the commonly employed optimization techniques.",industry

Significant ATFM acquisitions in the last 5 years include South Africa, Australia and India. Singapore, Thailand and Korea are all expected to procure ATFM systems within a year while China is expected to develop a bespoke system.

In recent years, research has been conducted on single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, with promising results. In particular, back-propagation has been adopted as a gradient descent-based algorithm for training networks. However, when managing a large number of items, it is not feasible to optimize networks at item level, due to the effort required for tuning the parameters during the training stage. A simpler and faster learning algorithm, called the extreme learning machine, has been therefore proposed in the literature to address this issue, but it has never been tried for forecasting intermittent demand. On the one hand, an extensive comparison of single-hidden layer networks trained by back-propagation is required to improve our understanding of them as predictors of intermittent demand. On the other hand, it is also worth testing extreme learning machines in this context, because of their lower computational complexity and good generalisation ability.

This awareness in combination with the variety of factors influencing the optimal management strategy and disposal route, introduces the need to optimise the sludge treatment throughout the whole chain instead of only minimising its production. In this paper, OPTIMASS, a mixed integer linear programming model to optimise strategic and tactical decisions in biomass-based supply chains, is proposed in order to meet this need. The applicability of OPTIMASS is illustrated through its implementation with a view to minimise the overall global warming impact of a real municipal wastewater sludge processing chain in âregion Xâ. A first scenario addresses the optimisation of the allocation and treatment of municipal wastewater sludge within the current network. Second, OPTIMASS is used to identify the optimal location(s) for new drying facilities in this chain.

But when the ANN is used in machine condition monitoring, it is either unlikely or uneconomical to experience all different real faults to generate sufficient training data. Therefore, model based method should be a viable way to generate adequate data to train the networks for the intelligent big-end bearing fault diagnosis in IC engines. In order to evaluate and update the simulation model, experiments with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances were first carried out on the engine test rig. It was found that the relevant diagnostic information lies in the squared envelope of the vibration signals. Therefore, we only need build a proper simulation model to simulate the correct envelope signals rather than the raw vibration signals. As the important inputs of the simulation model, the inertia properties of the simulated engine components were also measured and studied. Next, we built an ANN-based bearing knock diagnosis system which consists of three phases: fault detection phase, fault localization phase and fault severity identification phase. Particularly, a saturating linear function is selected as the transfer function of the fault severity identification stage, so the networks can linearly classify the fault levels and the output is more in agreement with the reality in industry. Following the feature extraction and selection from the processed squared envelope signals, the networks were purely trained by the simulated data with normal bearing clearance and with different oversize bearing clearances.

A benchmark of small size problems is considered to show the benefits of batching on group scheduling. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, several algorithms based upon tabu search are developed at three levels, which move back and forth between batching and scheduling phases. Two algorithms incorporate tabu search into the framework of path-relinking to exploit the information on good solutions. These tabu search/path-relinking algorithms comprise several distinguishing features including two relinking procedures to effectively construct paths and the stage-based improvement procedure to consider the move interdependency. The best tabu search algorithm as a local search algorithm is compared to a population-based algorithm, and the superiority of the former over the latter is shown using a statistical experiment. The initial solution finding mechanism is implemented to trigger the search into the solution space. The efficiency and effectiveness of the best algorithm is verified with the help of the results found by CPLEX. The results show that the best algorithm, based on tabu search/path relinking and the stage-based improvement procedure, could find solutions at least as good as CPLEX, but in drastically shorter computational time.

One of such systems is the Wize Mirror, built as a result of the FP7 funded SEMEOTICONS (SEMEiotic Oriented Technology for Individuals CardiOmetabolic risk self-assessmeNt and Self-monitoring) project. The project aims to translate the semeiotic code of the human face into computational descriptors and measures, automatically extracted from videos, multispectral images, and 3D scans of the face. The multisensory platform, being developed as the result of that project, in the form of a smart mirror, looks for signs related to cardio-metabolic risks. The goal is to enable users to self-monitor their well-being status over time and improve their life-style via tailored user guidance. This paper is focused on the description of the part of that system, utilising computer vision and machine learning techniques to perform 3D morphological analysis of the face and recognition of psycho-somatic status both linked with cardio-metabolic risks.

Decision support tools have thereby become essential to help electricity market players in their negotiation process.

Many industrial processes and physical phenomena, however, should be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) which offer both spatial and temporal distributions that are simply not available with ODE models. Systems described by a PDE belong to a class of system called distributed parameter system (DPS). This article presents a method for solving the problem of identification of uncertain DPSs using a differential neural network (DNN). The DPS, assumed to be described by a PDE, is approximated using the finite element method (FEM). The FEM discretizes the domain into a set of distributed and connected nodes, thereby, allowing a representation of the DPS in a finite number of ODEs. The proposed DNN follows the same interconnection structure of the FEM, thus allowing the DNN to identify the FEM approximation of the DPS in both 2D and 3D domains. Lyapunov's second method was used to derive adaptive learning laws for the proposed DNN structure. The identification algorithm, here developed in Nvidia's CUDA/C to reduce the execution time, runs mostly on the graphics processing unit (GPU). A physical experiment served to validate the 2D case. In the experiment, the DNN followed the trajectory of 57 markers that were placed on an undulating square piece of silk. The proposed DNN is compared against a method based on principal component analysis and an artificial neural network trained with group search optimization. In addition to the 2D case, a simulation validated the 3D case, where input data for the DNN was generated by solving a PDE with appropriate initial and boundary conditions over an unitary domain. Results show that the proposed FEM-based DNN approximates the dynamic behavior of both a real 2D and a simulated 3D system.",industry

Therefore, we propose a label consistent semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization (LCSSNMF) framework that can simultaneously factorize both labeled and unlabeled data, where the discriminability of label data is preserved. Specifically, it firstly incorporates a class-wise coefficient distance regularization term that makes the coefficients for similar samples or samples with the same label close. Moreover, a label reconstruction regularization term is also presented, as the classification error with coefficient matrix of labeled data is expected as low as possible, which will potentially improve the classification accuracy in maintenance activities identification for industrial remote monitoring and diagnostics. The experiment results on real maintenance activities identification application from PHM 2013 data challenge competition demonstrate that LCSSNMF outperforms the state-of-arts NMF methods and results provided by the competition.",industry

Because collecting labeled data is expensive and time consuming, the amount of unlabeled data is increasing. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve conventional supervised learning methods by training from both unlabeled and labeled data. In contrast to classification problems, the estimation of labels for unlabeled data presents added uncertainty for regression problems. In this paper, a semi-supervised support vector regression (SS-SVR) method based on self-training is proposed. The proposed method addresses the uncertainty of the estimated labels for unlabeled data. To measure labeling uncertainty, the label distribution of the unlabeled data is estimated with two probabilistic local reconstruction (PLR) models. Then, the training data are generated by oversampling from the unlabeled data and their estimated label distribution. The sampling rate is different based on uncertainty. Finally, expected margin-based pattern selection (EMPS) is employed to reduce training complexity. We verify the proposed method with 30 regression datasets and a real-world problem: virtual metrology (VM) in semiconductor manufacturing. The experiment results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 8% compared with conventional supervised SVR, and the training time for the proposed method is 20% shorter than that of the benchmark methods.",industry

It is a common problem that the process plan and the schedule are not able to cope with the changes in real time manufacturing. Integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) is to conduct the process planning and scheduling functions concurrently, with the aim to improve the dynamic responsiveness of the production schedule. This paper investigates the formulation and implementation of constructive meta-heuristics for solving IPPS problems. To begin with, a model representation is established to express IPPS problems with AND/OR graphs. With this model representation, a generic framework is proposed for implementing constructive meta-heuristics in the solution model. The generic framework provides a common procedure for the constructive meta-heuristics, which encapsulates the calculation of the search frontier and state transitions, and provides two interfaces for accommodating different constructive search algorithms. Ant colony optimization (ACO), a commonly-used algorithm which possesses all typical characteristics of constructive meta-heuristics, is adopted as a representative example for illustrating the implementation. Experiments and tests are conducted to validate the proposed system. The single objective minimizing the makespan is set for evaluating the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results of the benchmark problems have shown the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed approach based on the integration of the generic framework and ACO strategy.",industry

To be of practical relevance, the local control mechanisms of the autonomous agents must be able to dependably adhere and dynamically adjust to complex numeric goal systems like business key performance indicators in an economically beneficial way. However, planning with numeric state variables and objectives still poses a challenging task within the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
                  In this article, a new general-purpose AI planning approach is presented that operates in two stages and extends existing domain-independent modeling formalisms like PDDL with continuous (i.e., infinite-domain) numeric action parameters, which are currently still unsupported by state-of-the-art AI planners. In doing so, it enables the solution of mathematical optimization problems at the action level of the planning tasks, which are inherent to many real-world control problems. To deal with certain difficulties concerning reliable and fast detection of action applicability that arise when planning with real-valued action parameters, the implemented planner allows resorting to an adjustable âsatisficingâ strategy by means of partial execution and subsequent repair of infeasible plans over the course of time. The functioning of the system is evaluated in a multi-agent simulation of a shop floor control scenario with focus on the effects the possible problem cases and different degrees of satisficing have on attained plan quality and total planning time.

By doing so, the authors aimed to obtain a generalist framework capable of summarizing relevant context-aware information which is able to follow, as close as possible, the stochastic dynamics on the human mobility behavior. Its potential impact ranges Expert Systems for decision support across multiple industries, from demand estimation for public transportation planning till travel time prediction for intelligent routing systems, among others.

It has become apparent that the resource inputs and effluents of industrial processes and the other units including the business centres, civic objects and even agricultural plants can and are often connected with each other. Most industrial plants and the other units throughout the world still use more energy and water than necessary, they are proven cases in the range 20 â 30 %, emitting too large volumes of Greenhouse Gases and other pollutants.
                  Water-saving measures and the reuse of water may reduce groundwater consumption by as much as 25 â 30 %. Usually reducing resource consumption is achieved by increasing internal recycling and the reuse of energy and material streams. Projects for improving process resource efficiencies can be very beneficial and also potentially improve the public perception of the companies.
                  Motivating, launching and carrying out such projects, however, involve appropriate optimisation, based on adequate process models, applied within the framework of appropriate resource minimisation strategies and procedures. Process Integration supporting process design, integration and optimisation has been around for nearly 45 years. It has been closely related to the development of process systems engineering, as well as utilising mathematical modelling and information technology.
                  In the broader sense Process Integration methods can be classified into those relying on process based insight and targeting on the one hand, mainly employing targeting, heuristics and artificial intelligenceâAI. On the other hand are the methods employing detailed mathematical models usually implemented as algebraic models with embedded superstructures in the case of process network synthesis. The methods relying on thermodynamic insights have been first published in the early 1980-s (Linnhoff and Flower, 1978) as well as those using mathematical programmingâMP (Papoulias and Grossmann, 1983). There can also be a combined approach (KlemeÅ¡ and Kravanja, 2013).
                  On the one hand, the concept relying on thermodynamic and/or physical insights using the well-known Pinch Analysis has been the more widely accepted in both academia and industry. Process Integration has thus converged towards two schools of thought, the thermodynamic based (Pinch) and the mathematically based MP, each having its own advantages and drawbacks. The thermodynamic school has mostly preceded that of the MP in generating ideas based on engineering creativity. The MP school has enacted its ideas and described them as explicit mathematical models for solving advanced PI problems.

Not only is the initial planning a tremendous task if there is a huge variety of products but also reacting to changes becomes more frequent and more demanding. Many algorithms being able to solve the static problem need to perform a full recalculation if there is disturbance in production which makes them too time consuming for instant reactions to changes in production.
                  Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has proven its potentials in solving the theoretical Job Shop Scheduling Problem offering the advantage of not needing an entire recalculation in the case of changes. But when using the algorithm for calculation in real time scenarios with returning data from production plants several restrictions have to be fulfilled. The reaction to those restriction is currently not sufficiently provided by implementations of the ACO which prevents the use in practical applications. These restrictions are modelled as constraints that can for example involve the reaction to disturbances like failures or manual changes. But also considering transportation times or providing the possibility to realize batch processes is discussed. There are different possibilities to realize the reactions to restrictions in ACO, but in this paper they are modelled as constraints affecting the ACO during optimization. The constraint propagation is implemented by restricting the selection of succeeding edges, an approach that only has little impact on computational performance.
                  In this paper the concept of constraining the Ant Colony Optimization in Job Shop Scheduling is being introduced and explained. Subsequently the demand for additional constraints is presented and enhancements to the existing approach are defined and commented theoretically.",industry

With the fixed number of control nodes, it is of great significance in both academic research and industrial applications to design the optimal control configurations of a directed network to make its controllability index (i.e., the maximum dimension of the controllable subnetwork) maximum. In this paper, a design strategy for the optimal control configurations is proposed, and the results of the experiments conducted on multiple real and model networks show the effectiveness of this design strategy compared to other commonly-used design strategies. Moreover, we have two interesting findings in the macroscopic level and the microscopic level, respectively: (1) the dense and homogeneous networks have larger controllability indexes than the sparse and heterogeneous ones; (2) the average in-degree of the controlled state nodes in the optimal control configurations is far less than that of the network, which provides us a heuristic way to design a sub-optimal control configuration. These findings are helpful to further our understanding on the interplay between the network structure and its control.",industry

In firms operating in low-complexity sectors, supplier selection generally leverages on few significant variables (price, delivery time, quality) and it is often left to the buyersâ experience. On the other hand, in industries characterised by remarkable product complexity, supplier selection systems gain the characteristics of a multi-stakeholder and multi-criteria problem, which needs to be theoretically formalised and realistically adapted to specific contexts.
                  An increasing number of researches have been devoted to the development of different methodologies to cope with this problem. Nevertheless, while the number of applications is growing, there is little empirical evidence of the practical usefulness of such tools, that are mainly tested on numerical examples or computational experiments and focused on a dyadic version of the problem, overlooking the wider set of actors involved in the decision-making problem. The result is a clear dichotomy between academic theory and business practice.
                  Therefore, the paper contributes to understand the above dichotomy by evaluating the applicability to real-world multi-stakeholder problems of the two main approaches proposed in the literature to deal with supplier selection, the analytic hierarchic process (AHP) and the fuzzy set theory (FST).

UAM was optimized for enhancing extraction efficiency of polyphenols and reducing time-consuming. In a first time, a preliminary study was carried out to optimize the solid/liquid ratio (6g of dry material per mL) and the particle size (0.26cm2) by conventional maceration (CVM). Under these conditions, the optimum conditions for polyphenols extraction by UAM, obtained by response surface methodology, were 0.67W/cm2 for the ultrasonic intensity (UI), 40Â°C for the processing temperature (T) and 43min for the sonication time (t). UAM was compared with CVM, the results showed that the quantity of polyphenols was improved by 40% (342.4 and 233.5mg of catechin equivalent per 100g of dry basis, respectively for UAM and CVM).

In this paper, a two-stage simulation-based hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm (TSSB-HEDA) is presented to schedule the permutation flowshop under stochastic processing times. To deal with processing time uncertainty, TSSB-HEDA evaluates candidate solutions using a novel two-stage simulation model (TSSM). This model first adopts the regression-based meta-modelling technique to determine a number of promising candidate solutions with less computation cost, and then uses a more accurate but time-consuming simulator to evaluate the performance of these selected ones. In addition, to avoid getting trapped into premature convergence, TSSB-HEDA employs both the probabilistic model of EDA and genetic operators of genetic algorithm (GA) to generate the offspring individuals. Enlightened by the weight training process of neural networks, a self-adaptive learning mechanism (SALM) is employed to dynamically adjust the ratio of offspring individuals generated by the probabilistic model.

On the other hand, determining how performance and reliability/availability of these systems vary as a function of configuration parameters, such as the amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the degree of in-memory replication of slices of data, is far from being a trivial task. Yet, it is an essential aspect of the provisioning process of cloud platforms, given that it has an impact on the amount of cloud resources that are planned for usage. To cope with the issue of predicting/analysing the behavior of different configurations of cloud in-memory data stores, in this article we present a flexible simulation framework offering skeleton simulation models that can be easily specialized in order to capture the dynamics of diverse data grid systems, such as those related to the specific (distributed) protocol used to provide data consistency and/or transactional guarantees. Besides its flexibility, another peculiar aspect of the framework lies in that it integrates simulation and machine-learning (black-box) techniques, the latter being used to capture the dynamics of the data-exchange layer (e.g. the message passing layer) across the cache servers. This is a relevant aspect when considering that the actual data-transport/networking infrastructure on top of which the data grid is deployed might be unknown, hence being not feasible to be modeled via white-box (namely purely simulative) approaches. We also provide an extended experimental study aimed at validating instances of simulation models supported by our framework against execution dynamics of real data grid systems deployed on top of either private or public cloud infrastructures. Particularly, our validation test-bed has been based on an industrial-grade open-source data grid, namely Infinispan by JBoss/Red-Hat, and a de-facto standard benchmark for NoSQL platforms, namely YCSB by Yahoo.

However, the slow speed, subjectivity, time consumption associated with manual assessment has been forcing the agriculture industry to apply automation through robots. The vision system of harvesting robot is responsible for two-tasks. The first task is the recognition of object (tomato) and second is the classification of recognized objects (tomatoes). In this paper, Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification approach (FRBCS) has been proposed to estimate the ripeness of tomatoes based on color. The two color depictions: red-green color difference and red-green color ratio are derived from extracted RGB color information. These are then compared as a criterion for classification. Fuzzy partitioning of the feature space into linguistic variables is done by means of a learning algorithm. A rule set is automatically generated from the derived feature set using Decision Trees. Mamdani fuzzy inference system is adopted for building the fuzzy rule based classification system that classifies the tomatoes into six maturity stages. Dataset used for experiments has been created using the real images that were collected from a farm. 70% of the total images were used for training and 30% images of the total were used for testing the dataset respectively.

To the best of our knowledge, the use of computation techniques for solving the aforementioned shortcomings is limited. As such, the idea of clustering and visualization pertaining to the failure modes in FMEA is proposed in this paper. A neural network visualization model with an incremental learning feature, i.e., the evolving tree (ETree), is adopted to allow the failure modes in FMEA to be clustered and visualized as a tree structure. In addition, the ideas of risk interval and risk ordering for different groups of failure modes are proposed to allow the failure modes to be ordered, analyzed, and evaluated in groups. The main advantages of the proposed method lie in its ability to transform failure modes in a complex FMEA worksheet to a tree structure for better visualization, while maintaining the risk evaluation and ordering features. It can be applied to the conventional FMEA methodology without requiring additional information or data. A real world case study in the edible bird nest industry in Sarawak (Borneo Island) is used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method. The experiments show that the failure modes in FMEA can be effectively visualized through the tree structure. A discussion with FMEA users engaged in the case study indicates that such visualization is helpful in comprehending and analyzing the respective failure modes, as compared with those in an FMEA table. The resulting tree structure, together with risk interval and risk ordering, provides a quick and easily understandable framework to elucidate important information from complex FMEA forms; therefore facilitating the decision-making tasks by FMEA users. The significance of this study is twofold, viz., the use of a computational visualization approach to tackling two well-known shortcomings of FMEA; and the use of ETree as an effective neural network learning paradigm to facilitate FMEA implementations. These findings aim to spearhead the potential adoption of FMEA as a useful and usable risk evaluation and management tool by the wider community.",industry

The models were made publicly available in a Food Safety Model Repository within the OpenML for Predictive Modelling in Food community project. Three different approaches were used to create new models in the model repositories: (1) all information relevant for model re-implementation is available in a scientific publication, (2) model parameters can be imported from tabular parameter collections and (3) models have to be generated from experimental data or primary model parameters.

Soft sensors are mathematical models that use available data to provide real-time information on process variables when the information, for whatever reason, is not available by direct measurement. In this application, soft sensors are used to provide information on process variable normally provided by off-line laboratory tests performed at large time intervals. Cement fineness is one of the crucial parameters that define the quality of produced cement. Providing real-time information on cement fineness using soft sensors can overcome limitations and problems that originate from a lack of information between two laboratory tests. The model inputs were selected from candidate process variables using an information theoretic approach. Models based on multi-layer perceptrons were developed, and their ability to estimate cement fineness of laboratory samples was analyzed. Models that had the best performance, and capacity to adopt changes in the cement grinding circuit were selected to implement soft sensors. Soft sensors were tested using data from a continuous cement production to demonstrate their use in real-time fineness estimation. Their performance was highly satisfactory, and the sensors proved to be capable of providing valuable information on cement grinding circuit performance. After successful off-line tests, soft sensors were implemented and installed in the control room of a cement factory.

It relates mainly to industrial companies, where the minimization of energy consumption is one of their most important tasks they face.

The primary task of such a WPS is timely predicting expected heat consumption to prepare the technology characterized by long delays in advance. Heat prediction depends primarily on weather so the crucial part of WPS is the weather, especially temperature, prediction. However, a prediction system needs a variety of further data, too. Therefore, WPS must be regarded as a complex system, including data collection, its processing, own prediction and eventual decision support. This paper gives the overview about existing data processing systems and prediction methods and then it describes a concrete design of a WPS with distributed data measuring points (stations), which are processed using a structure of neural networks based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with a combination of fuzzy logic.

These requirements can be gathered into two groups: (i) fresh food related characteristics and (ii) packaging intrinsic characteristics. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) is an efficient way to delay senescence and spoilage and thus to extend the very short shelf life of respiring products such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Consequently, packaging O2/CO2 permeabilities must fit the requirements of fresh fruits and vegetable as predicted by virtual MAP simulating tools. Beyond gas permeabilities, the choice of a packaging material for fresh produce includes numerous other factors such as the cost, availability, potential contaminants of raw materials, process ability, and waste management constraints. For instance, the user may have the following multi-criteria query for his/her product asking for a packaging with optimal gas permeabilities that guarantee product quality and optionally a transparent packaging material made from renewable resources with a cost for raw material less than 3â¬/kg. To help stakeholders taking a rational decision based on the expressed needs, a new multi-criteria Decision Support System (DSS) for designing biodegradable packaging for fresh produce has been built.

Distinctive properties of the proposed method include its capability to process problems characterized by mixed-type data (quantitative, qualitative and interval) as well as a huge number of features. The key idea is to map simultaneously all the features of different types into a common space; the membership space. Once all features are represented in a homogeneous space, a feature weighting task can be performed in unified way. This weighting approach is integrated here within a fuzzy classifier through a fuzzy rule weighted concept in order to improve its performance. Each antecedent fuzzy set in the fuzzy ifâthen rule is weighted to characterize the importance of each proposition and therefore its corresponding feature. Weight estimation process is based on membership margin maximization to estimate a fuzzy weight of each feature in the membership space. Experiments on low and high dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve significantly the performance of the fuzzy rule-based as well as other state of the art classifiers and can even outperform classical feature weighting approaches.

Extracting the modules is critical for better software comprehension, efficient architecture recovery, determination of service candidates to migrate legacy software to a service-oriented architecture, and transportation of such services to cloud-based distributed systems. In this study, we propose a novel approach to automatic module extraction to identify services in OO software systems. In our approach, first we create a weighted and directed graph of the software system in which vertices and edges represent the classes and their relations, respectively. Then, we apply a clustering algorithm over the graph to extract the modules. We calculate the weight of an edge by considering its probability of being within a module or between modules. To estimate these positional probabilities, we propose a machine-learning-based classification system that we train with data gathered from a real-world OO reference system. We have implemented an automatic module extraction tool and evaluated the proposed approach on several open-source and industrial projects. The experimental results show that the proposed approach generates highly accurate decompositions that are close to authoritative module structures and outperforms existing methods.",industry

In such highly competitive industry, it has become an important strategy to accelerate new products launching to the market to earn more shares. However, the lead times of pilot runs are usually long in new product development (NPD) processes, and reducing pilot runs has thus become one of the key tasks of manufacturing systems. Specifically, since the shorter a test period is the smaller sample size one can obtain, making that to find a small data learning method for a manufacturing system being a new challenge. Facing the problem, this work, based on the box plots and the fuzzy techniques, develops an approach to systematically generate synthetic samples to help stabilize the learning process for the used back-propagation neural network (BPN). A real learning task taken from the Array process of a TFT-LCD manufacturer (a new high-resolution product of 4K2K in 2013) is employed as an example to illustrate the details of the proposed method. The task contains nine inputs and 72 output manufacturing attributes, but only with 20 samples. It is quite difficult for most existing modeling algorithms to deal with such a high dimensional situation when the sample size is small. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the robustness and preciseness of a BPN forecasting model. In addition to the reduction of pilot runs, more process knowledge is obtained in the inputâoutput analysis.",industry

BLAST search analysis of 16S rRNA sequences showed that the homology of the highly enriched anammox consortia used here and Candidatus Jettenia asiatica (J. asiatica) reached 99%. Results showed that low acetate (â©½30mg/L) and propionate (â©½50mg/L) concentration does not significantly influence ammonium oxidation. Higher acetate/propionate concentrations caused decrease of ammonium removal. A level of acetate no more than 240mg/L caused the decrease of ammonium consumption rate by 33%, and 29% for propionate with (<400mg/L). J. asiatica showed higher adaptability to propionate stress than acetate.

Multivariate control charts (MCC) are important tools for monitoring multivariate processes. One difficulty encountered with multivariate control charts is the identification of the variable or group of variables that cause an out-of-control signal. Expert knowledge either in combination with wrapper-based supervised classifier or a pre-filter with wrapper are the standard approaches to detect the sources of out-of-control signal. However gathering expert knowledge in source identification is costly and may introduce human error.

                      statistics are also used in many cases simultaneously to identify the sources, but these either ignore the correlations between the sources or may take more time with the increase of dimensions. The aim of this paper is to develop a source identification approach that does not need any expert-knowledge and can detect out-of-control signal in less computational complexity. We propose, a hybrid wrapperâfilter based source identification approach that hybridizes a Mutual Information (MI) based Maximum Relevance (MR) filter ranking heuristic with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based wrapper. The Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) has been combined with MR (MR-ANNIGMA) to utilize the knowledge about the intrinsic pattern of the quality characteristics computed by the filter for directing the wrapper search process. To compute optimal ANNIGMA score, we also propose a Global MR-ANNIGMA using non-functional relationship between variables which is independent of the derivative of the objective function and has a potential to overcome the local optimization problem of ANN training. The novelty of the proposed approaches is that they combine the advantages of both filter and wrapper approaches and do not require any expert knowledge about the sources of the out-of-control signals. Heuristic score based subset generation process also reduces the search space into polynomial growth which in turns reduces computational time. The proposed approaches were tested by exhaustive experiments using both simulated and real manufacturing data and compared to existing methods including independent filter, wrapper and Multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) methods. The results indicate that the proposed approaches can identify the sources of out-of-control signals more accurately than existing approaches.",industry

It is often the case that due to reasons such as high cost of data acquisition and/or protection, only the transactional data are available for data mining operations. Transactional data, however, tend to be highly sparse and skewed due to a large proportion of customers engaging in very few transactions. This can result in a bias in the prediction accuracy of classifiers built using them. The problem is even more so when identifying and classifying changing customer profiles whose classification may change either due to a concept drift or due to a change in buying behaviour. This paper presents a comparative investigation of 4 approaches for classifying dynamic customer profiles built using evolving transactional data over time. The changing class values of the customer profiles were analysed together with the challenging problem of deciding whether to change the class label or adapt the classifier. The results from the experiments we conducted on a highly sparse and skewed real-world transactional data show that adapting the classifiers leads to more stable classification of customer profiles in the shorter time windows; while relabelling the changed customer profile classes leads to more accurate and stable classification in the longer time windows.",industry

Unfortunately, to be implemented, this kind of testing method often incurs very high costs (expensive instruments, long test timeâ¦). A common approach, in the literature, is the so-called indirect/alternate test strategy. This strategy consists in deriving targeted specifications from low-cost Indirect Measurements (IMs). During the industrial test phase, the estimation of regular specifications using IMs is based on a correlation model that has been built previously, during a training phase. Despite the substantial test cost reduction offered by this strategy, its deployment in industry is limited, mainly because of a lack of confidence in the accuracy of estimations made by the correlation model. A solution to increase the confidence in the estimation of specifications using the indirect approach is to implement redundancy in the prediction phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that the redundancy implementation brings more than identifying rare misjudged circuits from a high-correlated model. Indeed redundancy massively increases the accuracy despite of the lack of accurate models that have been assumed in previous implementations of redundant indirect testing. This approach is illustrated on a real case study for which we have experimental measurements on a set of 10,000 devices.",industry

A number of studies empirically investigated how facial attractiveness was influenced by 2D facial characteristics, such as symmetry, averageness and golden ratio. However, few implementations of facial beauty assessment were based on 3D facial features. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel cluster assessment system for facial attractiveness that is characterized by the incorporation of 3D geometric MoirÃ© features with an adjusted fuzzy neural network (FNN). We first extract 3D facial features from images acquired by a 3dMD scanner. Seven MoirÃ© features are employed to represent a 3D facial image. The FNN classifier, taking the MoirÃ© features as the parameters, is then trained and validated against independently conducted attractiveness ratings. A number of diverse referees were invited and offered their attractiveness ratings over a five-item Likert scale for 100 female facial images. The proposed assessment presents a high accuracy rate of 90%, and the area under curve (AUC) computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.95. The results show that the perceptions of facial attractiveness are essentially consensus among raters, and can be mathematically modeled through supervised learning techniques. The high accuracy achieved proves that the proposed FNN classifier can serve as a general, automated and human-like judgment tool for objective classification of female facial attractiveness, and thus has potential applications to the entertainment industry, cosmetic industry, virtual media, and plastic surgery.",industry

Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the fermentation process which include lactic and acetic acids and ethanol concentrations, enumerations of lactic acid producing bacteria, yeasts, total coliforms and Escherichia coli, were monitored and analyzed as a function of the main feed control factors: incubation time, operating temperature, feed time schedule and percentage of leftover. From batch experiments, it was observed that increasing the operating temperature from 15 to 30Â°C, accelerates the rate of fermentation by reducing about 5â6-folds the process latency and the duration to reach a pH value of 4.0 which is considered as optimal to achieve biosafety.

Cement fineness is an important quality parameter in the cement grinding process. However, very few studies have been done for soft sensing of cement fineness in the grinding process. Moreover, most of the grinding process modeling approaches have been reported for ball mills and rarely any modeling of vertical roller mill is available. In this research, modeling of vertical roller mill used for clinker grinding has been done using support vector regression (SVR), fuzzy inference and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference(ANFIS) techniques since these techniques have not yet been largely explored for particle size soft sensing. The modeling has been done by collection of the real industrial data from a cement grinding process followed by data cleaning and a structured method of dividing the data into training and validation data sets using the KennardâStone subset selection algorithm. Optimum SVR hyper parameters were determined using a combined approach of analytical method and grid search plus cross validation.

At constant total energy input, it was noticed that the metal concentration decreased upon increasing the field strength applied. These results were mainly attributed to the key role played by the pulse frequency in the charging process of the double layer capacitors at the electrodeâsolution interface. Moreover, it was shown that the amount of metal released from the electrodes markedly depended on the presence of halides in the composition of the processed product.

Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models have been used successfully as the reasoning engine behind such assistive systems for small multi-step tasks such as hand washing. POMDP models are a powerful, yet flexible framework for modelling assistance that can deal with uncertainty and utility. Unfortunately, POMDPs usually require a very labour intensive, manual procedure for their definition and construction. Our previous work has described a knowledge driven method for automatically generating POMDP activity recognition and context sensitive prompting systems for complex tasks. We call the resulting POMDP a SNAP (SyNdetic Assistance Process). The spreadsheet-like result of the analysis does not correspond to the POMDP model directly and the translation to a formal POMDP representation is required. To date, this translation had to be performed manually by a trained POMDP expert. In this paper, we formalise and automate this translation process using a probabilistic relational model (PRM) encoded in a relational database. The database encodes the relational skeleton of the PRM, and includes the goals, action preconditions, environment states, cognitive model, client and system actions (i.e., the outcome of the SNAP analysis), as well as relevant sensor models. The database is easy to approach for someone who is not an expert in POMDPs, allowing them to fill in the necessary details of a task using a simple and intuitive procedure. The database, when filled, implicitly defines a ground instance of the relational skeleton, which we extract using an automated procedure, thus generating a POMDP model of the assistance task. A strength of the database is that it allows constraints to be specified, such that we can verify the POMDP model is, indeed, valid for the task given the analysis. We demonstrate the method by eliciting three assistance tasks from non-experts: handwashing, and toothbrushing for elderly persons with dementia, and on a factory assembly task for persons with a cognitive disability. We validate the resulting POMDP models using case-based simulations to show that they are reasonable for the domains.

It is based on a sigmoid function which can effectively enhance noisy speech using simple computational operations, while a robust estimator based on an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to determine the appropriate operational parameters for the sigmoid function in order to produce effective speech enhancement under variant noisy conditions. The proposed hybrid noise suppression filter has the following advantages for commercial speech recognizers: (i) it is not possible to tune the inbuilt parameters on the commercial speech recognizers in order to obtain better accuracy; (ii) existing noise suppression filters are too complicated to be implemented for real-time speech recognition; and (iii) existing sigmoid function based filters can operate only in a single-noisy condition, but not under varying noisy conditions. The performance of the hybrid noise suppression filter was evaluated by interfacing it with a commercial speech recognizer, commonly used in electronic products. Experimental results show that improvement in terms of recognition accuracy and computational time can be achieved by the hybrid noise suppression filter when the commercial recognizer is working under various noisy environments in factories.",industry

We also comprehensively describe new and existing features for predicting algorithm runtime for propositional satisfiability (SAT), travelling salesperson (TSP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. We evaluate these innovations through the largest empirical analysis of its kind, comparing to a wide range of runtime modelling techniques from the literature. Our experiments consider 11 algorithms and 35 instance distributions; they also span a very wide range of SAT, MIP, and TSP instances, with the least structured having been generated uniformly at random and the most structured having emerged from real industrial applications.

This paper proposes a new ant colony optimization (MOACO) meta-heuristic considering not only production efficiency but also electric power cost (EPC) with the presence of time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices. The solution is encoded as a permutation of jobs. A list schedule algorithm is applied to construct the sequence by artificial ants and generate a complete schedule. A right-shift procedure is then used to adjust the start time of operations aiming to minimize the EPC for the schedule.

In terms of practical application aspect, the guideline about how to set preference over multiple objectives has been studied.

                  Method
                  The classification tree and neural network based crash risk assessment models developed with data from NB US-101 are applied to data from the same freeway, as well as to the data from nearby segments of the SB US-101, NB I-880, and SB I-880 corridors.

                  The model applications show that it is in fact possible to use the same model for multiple freeways, as the underlying relationships between traffic data and crash risk remain similar.

                  The framework provided here may be helpful to authorities for freeway segments with newly installed traffic surveillance apparatuses, since the real-time crash risk assessment models from nearby freeways with existing infrastructure would be able to provide a reasonable estimate of crash risk. The robustness of the model output is also assessed by location, time of day, and day of week. The analysis shows that on some locations the models may require further learning due to higher than expected false positive (e.g., the I-680/I-280 interchange on US-101 NB) or false negative rates. The approach for post-processing the results from the model provides ideas to refine the model prior to or during the implementation.",industry

In practice, most companies rely on experienced engineers to visually find the specific WBM patterns. However, as wafer size is enlarged and integrated circuit (IC) feature size is continuously shrinking, WBM patterns become complicated due to the differences of die size, wafer rotation, the density of failed dies and thus human judgments become inconsistent and unreliable. To fill the gaps, this study aims to develop a knowledge-based intelligent system for WBMs defect diagnosis for yield enhancement in wafer fabrication. The proposed system consisted of three parts: graphical user interface, the WBM clustering solution, and the knowledge database. In particular, the developed WBM clustering approach integrates spatial statistics test, cellular neural network (CNN), adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network, and moment invariant (MI) to cluster different patterns effectively. In addition, an interactive converse interface is developed to present the possible root causes in the order of similarity matching and record the diagnosis know-how from the domain experts into the knowledge database. To validate the proposed WBM clustering solution, twelve different WBM patterns collected in real settings are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in terms of purity, diversity, specificity, and efficiency.

Such a problem has been widely investigated in the literature. Most approaches use optimization technique to determine the position of each facility, assuming that the required data is available. Unfortunately, this assumption is often unrealistic, since the study design of a workshop is obviously conducted much before it is operating, so that data related to customer demands, for example, is generally not known with enough precision. Indeed, if good forecasts about what is to be produced in the next weeks can be available, they will obviously become more and more unreliable as the considered period of time will increase, so that layout found using classical approaches can turn out not to be relevant on the medium or long term. We propose an approach to design a robust layout in a context where the certainty of the information available decreases over time, which is usually the case for real applications.

Here, we first examined the effects of passive exposure to a more structured, real-world noise, consisting of a mix of power tool and construction sounds. This âfactory noiseâ had less pronounced effects on adult cat AI than our previous random tone pip ensembles and white noise, and these effects appeared limited to the region of AI tuned to frequencies near the sharp factory noise cutoff at 16Â kHz. To further investigate the role of sharp spectral edges in passive exposure-induced cortical plasticity, a second group of adult cats was exposed to a tone pip ensemble with a flat spectrum between 2 and 4Â kHz and shallow cutoff slopes (12Â dB/oct) on either side. Compared to our previous ensemble with the same power in the 2â4Â kHz band but very steep slopes, exposure to the overall more intense, sloped stimulus had much weaker effects on AI. Finally, we explored the issue of exposure stimulus spectrotemporal density and found that low aggregate tone pip presentation rates of about one per second sufficed to induce changes in the adult AI similar to those characteristic of our previous, much denser exposures. These results are discussed in light of the putative mechanisms underlying exposure-induced auditory cortical plasticity, and the potential adverse consequences of working or living in moderately noisy environments.",industry

Taylorism and the Hawthorn experiments all contributed to optimising industrial outputs and value engineers continue to promote a mecha- nized workforce in order to minimise business variations in human performance and their behaviour.

Among the applications of laser technology, laser cladding has received significant attention due to its high potential for material processing such as metallic coating, high value component repair, prototyping, and even low-volume manufacturing. In this paper, two optimization methods have been applied to obtain optimal operating parameters of Laser Solid Freeform Fabrication Process (LSFF) as a real world engineering problem. First, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was implemented for real-time prediction of melt pool geometry. Then, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm called Self-organizing Pareto based Evolutionary Algorithm (SOPEA) was proposed to find the optimal process parameters. For further assurance on the performance of the proposed optimization technique, it was compared to some well-known vector optimization algorithms such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA 2). Thereafter, it was applied for simultaneous optimization of clad height and melt pool depth in LSFF process. Since there is no exact mathematical model for the clad height (deposited layer thickness) and the melt pool depth, the authors developed two Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to estimate these two process parameters. Optimization procedure being done, the archived non-dominated solutions were surveyed to find the appropriate ranges of process parameters with acceptable dilutions. Finally, the selected optimal ranges were used to find a case with the minimum rapid prototyping time.

The assignment of tasks to stations is due to restrictions which can be expressed in a precedence graph. However, (automotive) manufacturers usually do not have sufficient information on their precedence graphs. As a consequence, the elaborate solution procedures for different versions of ALBP developed by more than 50years of intensive research are often not applicable in practice.
                  Unfortunately, the known approaches for precedence graph generation are not suitable for the conditions in the automotive industry. Therefore, we describe a new graph generation approach that is based on learning from past feasible production sequences and forms a sufficient precedence graph that guarantees feasible line balances. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed procedure is able to approximate the real precedence graph sufficiently well to detect optimal or nearly optimal solutions for a well-known benchmark data set. Even for additional large instances with up to 1,000 tasks, considerable improvements of line balances are possible. Thus, the new approach seems to be a major step to close the gap between theoretical line balancing research and practice of assembly line planning.",industry

In this paper we investigate the efficiency of EmNNs and compare their performance to conventional NNs when applied to credit risk evaluation.

                  The orthodontic acrylic materials Orthocryl EQ (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany), Orthoplast (Vertex Dental, Zeist, The Netherlands), and O-80 (Imicryl, Konya, Turkey) were prepared with 2 polymerization methods (doughing and spray on). Totally, 60 cylinders (5 Ã 2 mm), fabricated by using a different acrylic and method, were divided into 6 groups. Gingival fibroblasts were isolated from gingival connective tissue of systemically healthy subjects. Materials were incubated in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium culture medium (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) for 72 hours according to ISO 10993-5 standards (surface area to volume ratio of the specimen to cell-culture medium: 3 cm2/mL). Gingival fibroblasts were maintained with Dulbeccoâs modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A real-time cell analyzer (RT-CES, xCELLigence; Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany, and ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, Calif) was used to evaluate cell survival. After seeding 200 Î¼L of the cell suspensions into the wells (20,000 cells/well) of the E-plate 96, gingival fibroblasts were treated with bioactive components released by the acrylic materials (1/1 and 1/2 dilutions) and monitored every 15 minutes for 121 hours. For the proliferation experiments, the statistical analyses used were 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons tests.
               
                  Results
                  There was no significant difference between the cell indexes of the control and study groups for the 1/1 and 1/2 dilutions at 21 and 32 hours.

The neural network controller has been utilized to compare the capability of set-point tracking with a PID controller in this process. For this process neural network-based controller dosed in less Fe2+ solution compared to the PID controller which hence reduces wastage of chemicals. Industrial Cr6+ wastewater samples obtained from an electro-plating factory has also been tested on the pilot plant using the neural network-based controller to determine its effectiveness to control the reduction process for a real plant. The results indicate the proposed controller is capable of fully reducing the Cr6+âCr3+ in the batch treatment process with minimal dosage of Fe2+.,industry

There are many well-established and widely-adopted forecasting methods such as linear extrapolation and SARIMA. However, their performance is far from perfect and it is especially true when the sales pattern is highly volatile. In this paper, we propose a hybrid forecasting scheme which combines the classic SARIMA method and wavelet transform (SW). We compare the performance of SW with (i) pure SARIMA, (ii) a forecasting scheme based on linear extrapolation with seasonal adjustment (CSD+LESA), and (iii) evolutionary neural networks (ENN). We illustrate the significance of SW and establish the conditions that SW outperforms pure SARIMA and CSD+LESA. We further study the time series features which influence the forecasting accuracy, and we propose a method for conducting sales forecasting based on the features of the given sales time series. Experiments are conducted by using real sales data, hypothetical data, and publicly available data sets. We believe that the proposed hybrid method is highly applicable for forecasting sales in the industry.",industry

Near infrared (near-IR, NIR, or NIRS) spectroscopy (>4000cmâ1) has previously been reported as a cheap and fast alternative for biodiesel quality control when compared with infrared, Raman, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods; in addition, NIR can easily be done in real time (on-line). In this proof-of-principle paper, we attempt to find a correlation between the near infrared spectrum of a biodiesel sample and its base stock. This correlation is used to classify fuel samples into 10 groups according to their origin (vegetable oil): sunflower, coconut, palm, soy/soya, cottonseed, castor, Jatropha, etc. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for outlier detection and dimensionality reduction of the NIR spectral data. Four different multivariate data analysis techniques are used to solve the classification problem, including regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), partial least squares method/projection on latent structures (PLS-DA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) technique, and support vector machines (SVMs). Classifying biodiesel by feedstock (base stock) type can be successfully solved with modern machine learning techniques and NIR spectroscopy data. KNN and SVM methods were found to be highly effective for biodiesel classification by feedstock oil type. A classification error (E) of less than 5% can be reached using an SVM-based approach. If computational time is an important consideration, the KNN technique (E
                     =6.2%) can be recommended for practical (industrial) implementation. Comparison with gasoline and motor oil data shows the relative simplicity of this methodology for biodiesel classification.",industry

A modified crowding distance is proposed in cooperation with a coarse-to-fine approaching strategy based on the iterations between NSGA-II and BPNN. The results of mathematical model problems show the effect of these improving strategies. An industrial application case is implemented on a transonic axial compressor. The optimization objectives are to maximize efficiencies of two working points and to minimize the variation of the choked mass flow. CFD simulation is employed to provide the performance evaluation of initial training samples for BPNN. The optimized results are compared with optimization results of a single objective optimization based on weighting function. The comparison shows that the present framework can provide not only better solutions than the single objective optimization, but also various alternative solutions. The increase of computational costs is acceptable especially when approximation models are used.",industry

In the present paper, a similar framework is proposed for the aerodynamic optimization of turbomachinery by coupling the well known multi-objective genetic algorithmâNSGA-II and back propagation neural network. The verification results of mathematical problems show that the coupled method with the origin NSGA-II cannot get the real Pareto front due to the prediction error of BPNN. A modified crowding distance is proposed in cooperation with a coarse-to-fine approaching strategy based on the iterations between NSGA-II and BPNN. The results of mathematical model problems show the effect of these improving strategies. An industrial application case is implemented on a transonic axial compressor. The optimization objectives are to maximize efficiencies of two working points and to minimize the variation of the choked mass flow. CFD simulation is employed to provide the performance evaluation of initial training samples for BPNN. The optimized results are compared with optimization results of a single objective optimization based on weighting function.

In the present paper, a similar framework is proposed for the aerodynamic optimization of turbomachinery by coupling the well known multi-objective genetic algorithmâNSGA-II and back propagation neural network. The verification results of mathematical problems show that the coupled method with the origin NSGA-II cannot get the real Pareto front due to the prediction error of BPNN. A modified crowding distance is proposed in cooperation with a coarse-to-fine approaching strategy based on the iterations between NSGA-II and BPNN. The results of mathematical model problems show the effect of these improving strategies. An industrial application case is implemented on a transonic axial compressor. The optimization objectives are to maximize efficiencies of two working points and to minimize the variation of the choked mass flow. CFD simulation is employed to provide the performance evaluation of initial training samples for BPNN. The optimized results are compared with optimization results of a single objective optimization based on weighting function.

The verification results of mathematical problems show that the coupled method with the origin NSGA-II cannot get the real Pareto front due to the prediction error of BPNN.

This demands engineers with an in-depth understanding of lean philosophies. Current methods for teaching lean include hands-on projects and simulation. However, simulation games available in the market lack simplicity, ability to store the results, and modeling power. The goal of this research is to develop a virtual simulation platform which would enable students to perform various experiments by applying lean concepts. The design addresses these deficiencies through the use of VE-Suite, a virtual engineering software. The design includes user-friendly dialogue boxes, graphical models of machines, performance display gauges, and an editable layout. The platform uses laws of operations management such as Little's law, economic order quantity (EOQ) models, and cycle time. These laws enable students to implement various lean concepts such as pull system, just-in-time (JIT), single piece flow, single minute exchange of dies (SMED), kaizen, kanban, U-layout, by modifying the process parameters such as process times, setup times, layout, number, and placement of machines. The simulation begins with a traditional push type mass production line and the students improve the line by implementing lean techniques. Thus, students experience the advantages of lean real time while facing the real life problems encountered in implementing it.",industry

System integration and the automation of the workflows required to develop oil production operations are two main problems nowadays at the oil and gas production industry. This work approaches these problems through the implementation of distributed artificial intelligence architecture, designed for the automated production management. The architecture comprises a standardized schema to access information sources, a production ontological framework and an intelligent workflow mechanism based on multi-agent systems and electronic institution. Our architecture present several novelties: the incorporation of the semantic integration, the extension of the agents theory through the electronic institutions paradigm to solve the real-time decision problems typical in the industry, the Holon-Agent hybrid model used to make more feasible its implementation, among others.

The system comprises three stages. First, the wavelet transform using the Haar wavelet is applied to decompose the stock price time series and thus eliminate noise. Second, the RNN, which has a simple architecture and uses numerous fundamental and technical indicators, is applied to construct the input features chosen via Stepwise Regression-Correlation Selection (SRCS). Third, the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is utilized to optimize the RNN weights and biases under a parameter space design. For illustration and evaluation purposes, this study refers to the simulation results of several international stock markets, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA), London FTSE-100 Index (FTSE), Tokyo Nikkei-225 Index (Nikkei), and Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX).

In the present paper, a similar framework is proposed for the aerodynamic optimization of turbomachinery by coupling the well known multi-objective genetic algorithmâNSGA-II and back propagation neural network. The verification results of mathematical problems show that the coupled method with the origin NSGA-II cannot get the real Pareto front due to the prediction error of BPNN. A modified crowding distance is proposed in cooperation with a coarse-to-fine approaching strategy based on the iterations between NSGA-II and BPNN. The results of mathematical model problems show the effect of these improving strategies. An industrial application case is implemented on a transonic axial compressor. The optimization objectives are to maximize efficiencies of two working points and to minimize the variation of the choked mass flow. CFD simulation is employed to provide the performance evaluation of initial training samples for BPNN. The optimized results are compared with optimization results of a single objective optimization based on weighting function. The comparison shows that the present framework can provide not only better solutions than the single objective optimization, but also various alternative solutions. The increase of computational costs is acceptable especially when approximation models are used.",industry
