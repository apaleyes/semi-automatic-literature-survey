However, counting passengers in highly crowded scenes is a challenging task due to their random movement, diverse appearance settings and inter-object occlusions. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods in this domain rely heavily on additional custom cameras or sensors instead of existing onboard surveillance cameras, which consequently limits the feasibility of such systems for large-scale deployment. Hence, this paper puts forward an enhanced appearance descriptor with lateral movement compensation, which addresses the difficulty in counting passengers bidirectionally in cluttered scenes. We first construct a head re-identification dataset, which is used to train an appearance descriptor. This dataset addresses the absence of a person re-identification dataset, which in turn allows for accurate tracking of passengers in cluttered scenes. Then, a novel technique of applying a fedora counting line is introduced to count the number of passengers entering and exiting a bus. This technique compensates the impact of passengers’ lateral movement, which crucially increases the accuracy of bidirectional passenger counting using onboard bus surveillance cameras. In addition, a real-time implementation of the proposed method, which includes the integration of DeepStream and fedora counting line, is also presented. Experimental results on a challenging test dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmarked techniques with an average counting accuracy of 93.21% for entering and 96.10% for exiting public buses. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves this accuracy at an average frame rate of 16 frames per second, which represents a practical solution to a real-time application.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-021-05760-x,springer

A car's waiting time is highly related to the period in which the traffic lights are green or red; thus, a proper controlling policy reduces the waiting time and speeds up the car movement. Emergency vehicles always have a higher priority than other cars and need to reach their destination faster. In the last decade, a lot of research has been done to solve the traffic light scheduling issue using artificial intelligence techniques. Reinforcement learning with simulating human learning has the outstanding performance to solve complex problems, such as traffic lights control. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning traffic light control was implemented at a crossroad using real-time traffic information with an emphasis on emergency vehicles. The agent learns to adjust its policies to prioritize the emergency cars over the other cars. The results show less waiting time and speed up the cars’ movement. It also indicates the emergency vehicles will cross the intersection with the least delay. With 200 to 600 cars and one emergency vehicle, the average delay decreases 2–16% in total using reinforcement learning. Considering more emergency vehicles, there is a 27–40% decrease in average delay for emergency vehicles.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11227-021-04068-w,springer

Article,doi:10.1007/s11135-021-01263-y,A machine-learning based hybrid algorithm for strategic location of urban bundling hubs to support shared public transport,Quality & Quantity,10.1007/s11135-021-01263-y,Springer,2021-10-22,2021-10-22,"The location problem of Bundling Hubs (BHs) remains a contentious issue for efficient shared transportation systems. In this respect, the strategic configuration of BHs plays a crucial role in saving supply costs, covering demand, and minimizing the external effects of Shared Passenger and Freight Public Transportation (SPFPT). As urban areas become crowded, they show a significant increase in congestion and transport demand. Thus, sites where logistic operations, sales, or services are likely to occur, imply the final customers whose transport demand is a key factor that could affect cargo distribution using SPFPT systems. Since each BH should help efficiently to satisfy the transport demand of allocated customers, they would not play their key role if such factor of demand is not involved upstream in the long-term scheduling horizon. This paper focuses on locating BHs, using a Hybrid Robust Machine Learning-Heuristic Algorithm (HR-MLHA), among established ones and existing demand nodes while assessing a dynamic process so that the configured BH network is robust. The feature of robustness is supported by a robust command to keep BHs attractive and demand-responsive for the long-term in dynamic environments, i.e., the cities. To reduce complexity, the conceptual and computational approaches are structured in two main axes. The first axis includes a machine-learning-based zoning approach that helps with targeting the implementation area and assessing demand behavior. The second axis presents a mathematical model of the capacitated two-echelon BH location problem. When looking across the two-echelon location process, we aim at conducting dynamic location analysis using both current and predicted demand. In order to validate our approach, a set of benchmarks has been performed comparing with existing heuristics and using a whole package of experimental and real-life instances. The experimental results provided through the proposed approach have allowed valuable insights into successfully implementing our methodology.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11135-021-01263-y,springer

Firstly, we train a CNN to identify and determine the target bounding box in a traffic scene. Secondly, we use a particle filter (PF) as the tracker to implement the preliminary multi-object tracking. Finally, the multi-object tracking trajectory then is generated by the mutual supervision of the PF tracker and CNN detector. In order to evaluate the experimental results, we use the forward-backward (FB) error of our tracker at a certain moment.

Specifically, we design a multitask framework consisting of four components: a region-flow encoder for modeling region-flow dynamics, a transition-flow encoder for exploring transition-flow correlations, a context modeling component for contextualized fusion of two types of traffic flows and a task-specific decoder for predicting traffic flows. Particularly, we introduce Dual-attention Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (DGCGRU) to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal dependencies, which integrate graph convolution and recurrent model as a whole.

In this paper, we start by highlighting time series analysis requirements, to propose a new model for conditional multivariate time series forecasting based on the lately introduced WaveNet architecture. Our model is composed of stacked residual causal dilated convolutions that provide large scope in time series history and foster learning of long-term dependencies. Parameterized skip connections allow catching early trends and properties while conditioning enables modeling the associations that exist between multivariate data. We used group normalization for its stability and independence from the batch size. We present a deep comparison of the structure, flexibility, flow control, memory consumption, robustness and stability capacities of our new model against those of recurrent neural networks state-of-the-art approaches—long-short-term-memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To assess the performances of our model, we conduct extensive experimental testing on the task of urban air quality prediction in Marrakesh city using six real-world multi-sensor and multivariate time series datasets.

This not only enhances pollution but also leads to several road accident fatalities which may be greatly reduced by proper monitoring and surveillance. Further, with the advent of UAV technology and due to the incompatibility of traditional techniques, surveillance has become one of UAVs prominent application domains. However, it requires algorithmic analysis of aerial images which becomes extremely challenging due to multi-scale rotating objects with large aspect ratios, extremely imbalanced categories, cluttered background, and birds-eye view. Therefore, this article presents the novel aerial image traffic monitoring and surveillance algorithms based on the most advanced and popular DL object detection models (Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4) using the AU-AIR dataset. This dataset is exceedingly imbalanced and to resolve this issue, another 500 images have been grabbed by web-mining techniques. The novel contribution of this work is two-fold. First, this article scientifically distinguishes the inappropriateness of ground-view images for aerial object detection. Second, a regress comparison of these algorithms has been made to investigate their effectiveness. Extensive experimental analysis endorses the efficiency of YOLOv4 as it outperforms the other developed models by a minimum mAP margin of 88%.

A method for camera abnormal interference recognition based on the rolling prediction average algorithm is proposed. The core ideas of this method include the following steps. Firstly, the ImageNet pre-trained ResNet50 network on the self-built abnormal interference image training set is fine-tuned.

However, the number of available bikes in different stations may be imbalanced due to the free check-in and check-out of users. Therefore, predicting the bike demand in each station is an important task in a city to satisfy requests in different stations. Recent works mainly focus on demand prediction in settled stations, which ignore the realistic scenarios that bike stations may be deployed or removed. To predict station-level demands with evolving new stations, we face two main challenges: (1) How to effectively capture new interactions in time-evolving station networks; (2) How to learn spatial patterns for new stations due to the limited historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel S patial C ommunity-informed E volving G raphs (SCEG) framework to predict station-level demands, which considers two different grained interactions. Specifically, we learn time-evolving representation from fine-grained interactions in evolving station networks using EvolveGCN.

Moreover, the serialized form is insufficient to analog user complex POI moving behaviors.

Despite, the benefits accrued by the introduction of traffic management solutions (e.g. improved travel times, maximisation of throughput, etc.), these solutions usually fall short on ensuring the environmental sustainability around the implementation areas.

Recent emerging dataset street view image and deep learning have revealed the possibility to overcome the previous limits, thus bringing forward a research paradigm shift. In the experimental part, we disassemble the goal into three steps: firstly, capturing the street view images with coordinate information through the API provided by the street view service; then extracting facade images and cleaning up invalid data by using the deep-learning segmentation method; finally, calculating the dominant color based on the data on the Munsell Color System. Results can show whether the color status satisfies the requirements of its urban plan for façade color in the street.

In order to address those problems, we have designed and implemented an integrated development environment called CityFlow that supports developing machine learning applications.

With the growing ability of vehicles to collect spatial and temporal information solving the routine prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible.

A vehicle that is capable of predicting the next destination of the driver and when the driver intends to leave to that destination can prepare the journey in advance.

Unfortunately, all proposed up to now frameworks capable of estimating the contamination source localization based on recorded by the sensors network the substance concentrations are not able to work in real-time. The reason is the significant computational time required by the applied dispersion models. In such reconstruction systems, the parameters of the given dispersion model are sampled to fit the model output to the registrations; thus, the dispersion model is run tens of thousands of times. In this paper, we test the possibility of training an artificial neural network (ANN) to effectively simulate the atmospheric toxin transport in the highly urbanized area. The use of a fast neural network in place of computationally costly dispersion models in systems localizing the source of contamination can enable its fast response time. As a training domain, we have chosen the center of London, as it was used in the DAPPLE field experiment. The training dataset is generated by the Quick Urban & Industrial Complex (QUIC) Dispersion Modeling System.

PID controllers are an integral and most commonly used tuning method for control over non-linear systems due to their simplicity and ease of computational complexity. PID controllers are most useful to systems in real time in which the system control parameters vary very slowly or exhibit uncertainty consequently making prediction very complicated and delayed. Continuous and quick adaptation of PID controllers towards varying input determines the efficiency of the non-linear system and this research paper presents a radial basis neural network model in a chaotic configuration for tuning the PID controller in an adaptive manner. However, because mobile cloud computing inherits some characteristics of mobile computing itself, there may be problems such as network congestion, no signal area and crosstalk, which leads to the frequent failure of computing resources and service cooperation, which makes the availability of mobile cloud computing more difficult than traditional cloud calculate the more severe challenges. The scope of this research work is limited to training the neural network with a chaotic map and time series plots are obtained using the experimental results. The efficiency of the proposed chaotic network model is justified by the evaluation of accuracy and robustness of the model even in presence of disturbances.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10586-017-1197-5,springer

Accurate information on the arrival time is important for travel arrangements since it helps to decrease the wait time at a stop and to choose an optimal alternate route.

In the present paper, we analyze the abilities of the LSTM neural network to predict the arrival time of public vehicles. This model accounts for heterogeneous information about transport situation that directly or indirectly has an impact on the travel time prediction and includes statistical and real-time data of traffic flow.

In this regard, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for optimizing urban traffic control (UTC) based on the real-time traffic conditions. One of the RL-based algorithms is Distributed W-Learning (DWL) in which each agent has multiple policies and then this agent learns to optimize the traffic light control (green, red and so on) based on these policies . In this context, there are situations in which it is only necessary for the control agent to achieve its own policy, and other situations where the priority must be given to the performance of other control agents. As a result, DWL is able to learn how to optimize the entire UTC. In addition, DWL has a mediator that informs the control agents the traffic volume of each road, and these agents learn based on that information. However, the limitation of DWL is that it is based on Q-learning, therefore, it is difficult to optimize multiple policies when the control area expands. In addition, because the action values are represented by tables, these tables grow exponentially when applied to large-scale action spaces. Likewise, the ability to adapt to new environments becomes poor. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. The proposed approach uses Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm in order to optimize the traffic conditions more flexibly. The proposed approach utilizes deep learning for value function approximation. Therefore, the proposed approach has the advantage of being highly extensible and capable of predicting an action in large-scale action spaces even in unknown environments. The experimental results show the proposed approach is capable of optimizing multiple policies of the UTC, efficiently.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-29894-4_28,springer

In our proposed robust watermarking model, a double layer security is introduced to ensure the robustness of embedded data and then a transform domain-based hybrid watermarking technique, embeds the scrambled data into the transform coefficients of the cover image. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is work as a classifier, which classify a medical image into two distinct areas i.e. Non-Region of Interest (NROI) and Region of Interest (ROI).

In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on recurrent network and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict parking multi-steps ahead. The core idea of this framework is that both the occupancy rate of on-street parking in a specific region and car leaving probability are exploited as prediction performance metric.

Road monitoring systems are one of these solutions which support road users to make informed decisions. However, the current road traffic monitoring systems use road side infrastructures for road traffic data collection and these technologies lack accurate and up-to-date traffic data covering the whole road network.

We are seeing significant advances in the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles and an immense surge of shared mobility services, such as bike-sharing and ride-sourcing services like Uber- all promising to improve the life of the average urban commuter. There are significant obstacles to the deployment and/or full utilization of these technologies, however, which could be mitigated with an additional layer of transportation system monitoring. This chapter introduces the use of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV), or drones, as the cornerstone of an advanced and proactive new intelligent transportation system (ITS) called, iTRANS. This new approach will reveal important traffic variables that are currently unpredictable, as well as solve most jurisdictional conflicts of interest, and regulatory constraints. Furthermore, iTRANS is designed to be one of the main tools to complete a successful transition from a dysfunctional transportation system to an optimal linear programming one in which transportation supply and demand is proactively managed through advanced ITS software. This sophisticated ITS system, connected to open software platforms, would gather and integrate all available information from the different modes of transportation, allowing real-time traffic management of the entire transportation system, as a whole. In addition, this chapter addresses the current technologies, urban transportation challenges related to autonomous vehicles, and describes the multifaceted approach of iTRANS and how its application would be advantageous in the deployment of autonomous vehicles.

Many existing applications do not have the intelligence embedded to learn about the environmental parameters (such weather, incident etc.) that influence traffic flow; therefore, they are passive to the dynamic nature of vehicle traffic. This report proposes a deep learning neural networks method to optimise traffic flow and reduce congestion at key intersections, which will enhance the ability of signalized intersections to respond to changing traffic and environmental conditions. The input features of the proposed methods are composed of historical data of all the movements of an intended intersection, time series and environmental variables such as weather conditions etc. The method can learn about the region and predict traffic volumes at any point in time. The output (i.e. predicted traffic volume) is fed into the delay equation that generates best green times to manage traffic delay.

Journey prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary geographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge pricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open datasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies that emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more transparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price comparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover that Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher fares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in occurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone application, OpenStreetCab , that offers a personalized consultation to mobile users on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months after its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a single city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the potential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a highlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per taxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive experiments to show how Uber’s surge pricing is the driving factor of higher journey prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application’s users. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber’s surge pricing is occurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction task where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area’s tendency to surge. Using exogenous to Uber data, in particular Yellow Cab and Foursquare data, we show how it is possible to estimate customer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high accuracy.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0060-2,springer

Another very important reason is the persistent drive of many industries to increase efficiencies and the realisation that this requires more effective processing of gained knowledge and information. In the oil and gas industry, due to high saturation levels of many production fields and the complex nature of processes, the need for increased efficiencies and highly effective processing of a large amount of information is particularly evident. Some organisations have recognised the opportunities offered by AI-based techniques and started exploiting them in order to improve knowledge and information handling and process efficiencies. This paper discusses the application of two AI-based techniques, fuzzy logic (FL) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to specific problems related to the operation of oil and gas transport facilities. The background for the work, which is carried out in a co-operation between a university and a leading engineering service provider, is described firstly. This is followed by a brief summary of the fundamentals of the AI techniques considered with respect to their use for industrial purposes. then, two case studies are presented. The first case study demonstrates the application of fuzzy logic to the control of a pump station in a pipieline system whilst the second case study shows the use of an ANN for the determination of important pipeline characteristic. Problem backgrounds, design procedures and outlines for the implementation of the used AI techniques are given. Finally, benefits of the adopted approaches are highlighted and the wider impact on both industry and research community is discussed.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-0465-0_8,springer
