  Maximization in an Uncertain World","The potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle challenging problems
that afflict society is enormous, particularly in the areas of healthcare,
conservation and public safety and security. Many problems in these domains
involve harnessing social networks of under-served communities to enable
positive change, e.g., using social networks of homeless youth to raise
awareness about Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other STDs.
Unfortunately, most of these real-world problems are characterized by
uncertainties about social network structure and influence models, and previous
research in AI fails to sufficiently address these uncertainties. This thesis
addresses these shortcomings by advancing the state-of-the-art to a new
generation of algorithms for interventions in social networks. In particular,
this thesis describes the design and development of new influence maximization
algorithms which can handle various uncertainties that commonly exist in
real-world social networks. These algorithms utilize techniques from sequential
planning problems and social network theory to develop new kinds of AI
algorithms. Further, this thesis also demonstrates the real-world impact of
these algorithms by describing their deployment in three pilot studies to
spread awareness about HIV among actual homeless youth in Los Angeles. This
represents one of the first-ever deployments of computer science based
influence maximization algorithms in this domain. Our results show that our AI
algorithms improved upon the state-of-the-art by 160% in the real-world. We
discuss research and implementation challenges faced in deploying these
algorithms, and lessons that can be gleaned for future deployment of such
algorithms. The positive results from these deployments illustrate the enormous
potential of AI in addressing societally relevant problems.",arxiv

  Marketing Machine Learning Platform","In machine learning applications for online product offerings and marketing
strategies, there are often hundreds or thousands of features available to
build such models. Feature selection is one essential method in such
applications for multiple objectives: improving the prediction accuracy by
eliminating irrelevant features, accelerating the model training and prediction
speed, reducing the monitoring and maintenance workload for feature data
pipeline, and providing better model interpretation and diagnosis capability.
However, selecting an optimal feature subset from a large feature space is
considered as an NP-complete problem. The mRMR (Minimum Redundancy and Maximum
Relevance) feature selection framework solves this problem by selecting the
relevant features while controlling for the redundancy within the selected
features. This paper describes the approach to extend, evaluate, and implement
the mRMR feature selection methods for classification problem in a marketing
machine learning platform at Uber that automates creation and deployment of
targeting and personalization models at scale. This study first extends the
existing mRMR methods by introducing a non-linear feature redundancy measure
and a model-based feature relevance measure. Then an extensive empirical
evaluation is performed for eight different feature selection methods, using
one synthetic dataset and three real-world marketing datasets at Uber to cover
different use cases. Based on the empirical results, the selected mRMR method
is implemented in production for the marketing machine learning platform. A
description of the production implementation is provided and an online
experiment deployed through the platform is discussed.",arxiv

machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made.
This research field inspects the measures and models involved in
decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the
machine learning algorithms can not manifest how and why a decision has been
cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network
approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be
hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI
becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications,
especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep
neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The
insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be
one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI
tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first
surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in
healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging
multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two

healthcare back, as sample sizes are often small, patient information cannot be
shared openly, and multi-center collaborative studies are a burden to set up.
Distributed machine learning methods promise to mitigate these problems. We
argue for a split learning based approach and apply this distributed learning
method for the first time in the medical field to compare performance against
(1) centrally hosted and (2) non collaborative configurations for a range of
participants. Two medical deep learning tasks are used to compare split
learning to conventional single and multi center approaches: a binary
classification problem of a data set of 9000 fundus photos, and multi-label
classification problem of a data set of 156,535 chest X-rays. The several
distributed learning setups are compared for a range of 1-50 distributed
participants. Performance of the split learning configuration remained constant
for any number of clients compared to a single center study, showing a marked
difference compared to the non collaborative configuration after 2 clients (p <

  Encrypted Data","Remote monitoring to support ""aging in place"" is an active area of research.
Advanced computer vision technology based on deep learning can provide near
real-time home monitoring to detect falling and symptoms related to seizure,

machine learning algorithms), can potentially bring significant social and
health benefits. However, it has not been deployed in practice because of
privacy and security concerns. People may feel uncomfortable sending their
videos of daily activities (with potentially sensitive private information) to
a computing service provider (e.g., on a commercial cloud). In this paper, we
propose a novel strategy to resolve this dilemma by applying fully homomorphic

skeleton joints), which guarantees information confidentiality while retaining
high-performance action detection at a low cost. We design an FHE-friendly
neural network for action recognition and present a secure neural network

adversarial examples are capable of manipulating deep learning systems across
three clinical domains. For each of our representative medical deep learning
classifiers, both white and black box attacks were highly successful. Our
models are representative of the current state of the art in medical computer
vision and, in some cases, directly reflect architectures already seeing
deployment in real world clinical settings. In addition to the technical
contribution of our paper, we synthesize a large body of knowledge about the
healthcare system to argue that medicine may be uniquely susceptible to
adversarial attacks, both in terms of monetary incentives and technical
vulnerability. To this end, we outline the healthcare economy and the
incentives it creates for fraud and provide concrete examples of how and why
such attacks could be realistically carried out. We urge practitioners to be
aware of current vulnerabilities when deploying deep learning systems in

  Platform for Healthcare","In recent times, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based
systems have evolved and scaled across different industries such as finance,
retail, insurance, energy utilities, etc. Among other things, they have been
used to predict patterns of customer behavior, to generate pricing models, and
to predict the return on investments. But the successes in deploying machine
learning models at scale in those industries have not translated into the
healthcare setting. There are multiple reasons why integrating ML models into
healthcare has not been widely successful, but from a technical perspective,
general-purpose commercial machine learning platforms are not a good fit for
healthcare due to complexities in handling data quality issues, mandates to
demonstrate clinical relevance, and a lack of ability to monitor performance in
a highly regulated environment with stringent security and privacy needs. In
this paper, we describe Isthmus, a turnkey, cloud-based platform which
addresses the challenges above and reduces time to market for operationalizing
ML/AI in healthcare. Towards the end, we describe three case studies which shed
light on Isthmus capabilities. These include (1) supporting an end-to-end

in real life is challenging. This is often attributed to the sequential
decision making aspect: inaccuracies in simulation accumulate over multiple
steps, hence the simulated trajectories diverge from what would happen in
reality.
  In our work we show the need to consider another important aspect: the
mismatch in simulating control. We bring attention to the need for modeling
control as well as dynamics, since oversimplifying assumptions about applying
actions of RL policies could make the policies fail on real-world systems.
  We design a simulator for solving a pivoting task (of interest in Robotics)
and demonstrate that even a simple simulator designed with RL in mind
outperforms high-fidelity simulators when it comes to learning a policy that is
to be deployed on a real robotic system. We show that a phenomenon that is hard
to model - friction - could be exploited successfully, even when RL is
performed using a simulator with a simple dynamics and noise model. Hence, we
demonstrate that as long as the main sources of uncertainty are identified, it
could be possible to learn policies applicable to real systems even using a
simple simulator.
  RL-compatible simulators could open the possibilities for applying a wide
range of RL algorithms in various fields. This is important, since currently
data sparsity in fields like healthcare and education frequently forces
researchers and engineers to only consider sample-efficient RL approaches.
Successful simulator-aided RL could increase flexibility of experimenting with
RL algorithms and help applying RL policies to real-world settings in fields
where data is scarce. We believe that lessons learned in Robotics could help
other fields design RL-compatible simulators, so we summarize our experience
and conclude with suggestions.",arxiv

everyone in this field, not just to computer scientists. To show the potential
of this technology, we present results on a real-world task in veterinary
medicine that is usually done manually: feline reticulocyte percentage. Using

healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating
state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation

transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain
under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain
model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to
professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature

hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We, the
team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of
the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical
system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts.
Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable
machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be
considered when developing machine learning to support clinical
decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships
with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback
loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future
research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and

Synthetic EHRs offer a potential solution. In this paper, we propose EHR
Variational Autoencoder (EVA) for synthesizing sequences of discrete EHR

stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo with amortized variational

user studies with knowledgeable clinicians, indicate the generated EHR

with costs. This setting is representative for the real-world machine learning
applications. For instance, in the health-care domain, when training an AI

associated with a cost does not apply to such problem, because performing all
possible lab tests to acquire a new training datum would be costly, as well as
unnecessary due to redundancy. We propose Icebreaker, a principled framework to

combines recent advances in amortized inference and stochastic gradient MCMC to
enable fast and accurate posterior inference. By utilizing BELGAM's ability to
fully quantify model uncertainty, we also propose two information acquisition
functions for imputation and active prediction problems. We demonstrate that
BELGAM performs significantly better than the previous VAE (Variational
autoencoder) based models, when the data set size is small, using both machine

network bandwidth if highly expressive network architecture is employed.
So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural

takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. However, it is not
clear how to find the optimal split without sacrificing the overall network
performance. To amalgamate these methods and thereby maximize their distinct

cause enormous obstacles if one hospital wants to deploy a new Sepsis detection
system. Different from the supervised learning setting, we need to use known
information (e.g., from another hospital with rich labeled data) to help build
a model with acceptable performance, i.e., transfer learning. In this paper, we
propose a semi-supervised optimal transport with self-paced ensemble framework
for Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, to transfer knowledge from the other
that has rich labeled data. In SPSSOT, we first extract the same clinical
indicators from the source domain (e.g., hospital with rich labeled data) and
the target domain (e.g., hospital with little labeled data), then we combine
the semi-supervised domain adaptation based on optimal transport theory with
self-paced under-sampling to avoid a negative transfer possibly caused by
covariate shift and class imbalance. On the whole, SPSSOT is an end-to-end
transfer learning method for Sepsis early detection which can automatically
select suitable samples from two domains respectively according to the number
of iterations and align feature space of two domains. Extensive experiments on
two open clinical datasets demonstrate that comparing with other methods, our
proposed SPSSOT, can significantly improve the AUC values with only 1% labeled
data in the target domain in two transfer learning scenarios, MIMIC

train models on carefully curated datasets to minimize missing data bias;
however, this reduces the usability of such models in production environments,

missing data is therefore crucial for practical application. While some
classifiers naturally handle missing data, others, such as deep neural
networks, are not designed for unknown values. We propose a novel neural
network modification to mitigate the impacts of missing data. The approach is
inspired by neuromodulation that is performed by biological neural networks.
Our proposal replaces the fixed weights of a fully-connected layer with a
function of an additional input (reliability score) at each input, mimicking
the ability of cortex to up- and down-weight inputs based on the presence of
other data. The modulation function is jointly learned with the main task using
a multi-layer perceptron. We tested our modulating fully connected layer on
multiple classification, regression, and imputation problems, and it either
improved performance or generated comparable performance to conventional neural
network architectures concatenating reliability to the inputs. Models with
modulating layers were more robust against degradation of data quality by
introducing additional missingness at evaluation time. These results suggest
that explicitly accounting for reduced information quality with a modulating

the inference to be only as strong as the justification permits. We explore
various forms of support (for e.g., k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and l_p-norm

real-world medical settings. A model that has high performance at one
institution may suffer a significant decline in performance when tested at
other institutions. While pooling datasets from multiple institutions and
retraining may provide a straightforward solution, it is often infeasible and
may compromise patient privacy. An alternative approach is to fine-tune the
model on subsequent institutions after training on the original institution.
Notably, this approach degrades model performance at the original institution,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we develop an
approach to address catastrophic forget-ting based on elastic weight
consolidation combined with modulation of batch normalization statistics under
two scenarios: first, for expanding the domain from one imaging system's data
to another imaging system's, and second, for expanding the domain from a large
multi-institutional dataset to another single institution dataset. We show that
our approach outperforms several other state-of-the-art approaches and provide

features from visual, vocal, and verbal modalities. We used a video dataset of
people communicating truthfully or deceptively in real-world, high-stakes
courtroom situations. We leveraged recent advances in automated emotion
recognition in-the-wild by implementing a state-of-the-art deep neural network
trained on the Aff-Wild database to extract continuous representations of
facial valence and facial arousal from speakers. We experimented with unimodal
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and SVM-based multimodal fusion methods to
identify effective features, modalities, and modeling approaches for detecting
deception. Unimodal models trained on facial affect achieved an AUC of 80%, and
facial affect contributed towards the highest-performing multimodal approach
(adaptive boosting) that achieved an AUC of 91% when tested on speakers who
were not part of training sets. This approach achieved a higher AUC than
existing automated machine learning approaches that used interpretable visual,
vocal, and verbal features to detect deception in this dataset, but did not use

significant differences in facial valence and facial arousal, contributing

quality measures. Supervised deep learning methods have been investigated to
implement numerical observers for task-based image quality assessment. However,
labeling large amounts of experimental data to train deep neural networks is
tedious, expensive, and prone to subjective errors. Computer-simulated image
data can potentially be employed to circumvent these issues; however, it is
often difficult to computationally model complicated anatomical structures,
noise sources, and the response of real world imaging systems. Hence, simulated
image data will generally possess physical and statistical differences from the
experimental image data they seek to emulate. Within the context of machine
learning, these differences between the sets of two images is referred to as
domain shift. In this study, we propose and investigate the use of an
adversarial domain adaptation method to mitigate the deleterious effects of
domain shift between simulated and experimental image data for deep
learning-based numerical observers (DL-NOs) that are trained on simulated
images but applied to experimental ones. In the proposed method, a DL-NO will
initially be trained on computer-simulated image data and subsequently adapted
for use with experimental image data, without the need for any labeled
experimental images. As a proof of concept, a binary signal detection task is
considered. The success of this strategy as a function of the degree of domain

inexpensive domain adaptation layer at the output of a deep learning model

provide robustness to unbounded shifts, resulting in overly conservative
models. In this work, we combine the complementary strengths of the two
approaches and propose a new formulation, RISe, for designing robust models
against a set of distribution shifts that are at the intersection of
