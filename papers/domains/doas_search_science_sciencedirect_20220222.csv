The developed approach comprises an ensemble of three novel ML algorithms namely; random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosted trees (ExGBT), and deep learning (DL). These algorithms are trained to account for a wide collection of geometric characteristics and material properties, as well as loading conditions to examine fire performance of normal and high strength RC columns by analyzing a comprehensive database of fire tests comprising of over 494 observations. The developed ensemble is also capable of presenting quantifiable insights to ML predictions; thus, breaking free from the notion of “black-box” ML and establishing a solid step towards transparent and explainable ML. Most importantly, this work tackles the scarcity of available fire tests by proposing new techniques to leverage the use of real, synthetic, and augmented fire test observations. The developed ML ensemble has been calibrated and validated for standard and design fire exposures and one-, two-, three- and four-sided fire exposures thus; covering a wide range of practical scenarios present during fire incidents. When fully deployed, the developed ensemble can analyze over 5,000 RC columns in under 60 s; thus, providing an attractive solution for researchers and practitioners. The presented approach can also be easily extended for evaluating fire resistance and spalling of other structural members under varying fire scenarios and loading conditions and hence paves the way to modernize the state of this research area and practice.",science

However, fast and accurate inference for processes of complex systems cannot easily be achieved in real-time with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world conditions with the requirement of a real-time response. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with traditional techniques based on optimization or sampling often suffers from computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two different physics-based models of turbofan engines. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms all other tested methods in terms of speed and robustness, with high inference accuracy.",science

There are a variety of techniques and algorithms that can be deployed to address each aspect. To date, most review papers have concentrated on steady-state and single-phase flow conditions. The goal of the current review is therefore to carry out a thorough analysis of the available leak detection and diagnosis methods by focusing on (i) multiphase flow and transient flow conditions, (ii) model-based and data-driven techniques, (iii) prediction tools, and (iv) performance measures. Detailed assessment of leak detection methods based on accuracy, complexity, data requirement, and cost of installation are discussed. Data-driven techniques are utterly dependent on qualitative and quantitative data available from pipeline systems. Contrastingly data-driven techniques, model-based techniques require less data to achieve leak detection, provided that a nearly accurate base model is available. Different methodologies and technologies can be combined in order to produce the best detection and diagnosis outputs. In many cases, statistical analysis was combined with the Real Time Transient Method (RTTM), which helped to minimize false alarms. The material in this review can be used as a robust guide for the design of diagnostic systems and further research.",science

                  Social distancing is an effective way to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many students and researchers have already attempted to use computer vision technology to automatically detect human beings in the field of view of a camera and help enforce social distancing. However, because of the present lockdown measures in several countries, the validation of computer vision systems using large-scale datasets is a challenge.
               
                  Methods
                  In this paper, a new method is proposed for generating customized datasets and validating deep-learning-based computer vision models using virtual reality (VR) technology. Using VR, we modeled a digital twin (DT) of an existing office space and used it to create a dataset of individuals in different postures, dresses, and locations. To test the proposed solution, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting people in a limited-sized dataset of real humans and a simulated dataset of humanoid figures.
               
                  Results
                  We detected the number of persons in both the real and synthetic datasets with more than 90% accuracy, and the actual and measured distances were significantly correlated (r=0.99). Finally, we used intermittent-layer- and heatmap-based data visualization techniques to explain the failure modes of a CNN.
               
                  Conclusions
                  A new application of DTs is proposed to enhance workplace safety by measuring the social distance between individuals. The use of our proposed pipeline along with a DT of the shared space for visualizing both environmental and human behavior aspects preserves the privacy of individuals and improves the latency of such monitoring systems because only the extracted information is streamed.",science

In order to properly decide on BS (de)activation, traffic predictions are needed, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used for this purpose. Since critical BS (de)activation decisions are not taken in proximity of minima and maxima of the traffic patterns, high accuracy in the traffic estimation is not required at those times, but only close to the times when a decision is taken. This calls for careful processing of the ANN traffic predictions to increase the probability of correct decision. Numerical performance results in terms of energy saving and traffic lost due to incorrect BS deactivations are obtained by simulating algorithms for traffic predictions processing, using real traffic as input. Results suggest that good performance trade-offs can be achieved even in presence of non-negligible traffic prediction errors, if these forecasts are properly processed. The impact of forecast processing for dynamic resource allocation on the BS failure rate is also investigated. Results reveal that conservative approaches better prevent BSs from hardware failure. Nevertheless, the deployment of newer devices, designed for fast dynamic networks, allows the adoption of approaches which frequently activate and deactivate BSs, thus achieving higher energy saving.",science

One of these tasks is argumentation mining which has received significant interest in recent years and is regarded as a key domain for future decision-making systems, behaviour modelling, and natural language understanding problems. Until recently, natural language modelling tasks, such as computational argumentation schemes, were often tested in controlled environments, such as persuasive essays, reducing unexpected behaviours that could occur in real-life settings, like a public debate on social media. Additionally, the growing demand for enhancing the trust and the explainability of the AI services has dictated the design and adoption of modelling schemes to increase the confidence in the outcomes of the AI solutions. This paper attempts to explore modelling argumentation in short text and proposes a novel framework for argumentation detection under the name Abstract Framework for Argumentation Detection (AFAD). Moreover, different proof-of-concept implementations are provided to examine the applicability of the proposed framework to very short text developing a rule-based mechanism and compare the results with data-driven solutions. Eventually, a combination of the deployed methods is applied increasing the correct predictions in the minority class on an imbalanced dataset. The findings suggest that the modelling process provides solid grounds for technical research while the hybrid solutions have the potential to be applied to a wide range of NLP-related tasks offering a deeper understanding of human language and reasoning.",science

In this context, a framework for the design and experimental evaluation of power-split control systems for ship propulsion is proposed. Using machine learning, data from ship operation are processed and 20 loading patterns are recognized; representative templates are extracted to be used as marine loading cycles in the energy management system development and testing. A ship propulsion model with wave disturbance is utilized to simulate realistic loading scenarios on the experimental facility. A predictive energy management system is presented, that controls the diesel engine and the electric motor/generator based on a strategy that defines the trade-off between fuel consumption and NOx emissions minimization. In addition the propeller load characteristics that are estimated and a speed predictor are utilized to aid the optimization within the 10 s prediction time window. A parametric simulation study is performed for the trade-off evaluation between fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction potential of the control scheme. Finally, utilizing an extracted loading cycle, the energy management system is experimentally implemented and tested in real-time operation, where it has to cope with environmental disturbance rejection and follow the desired speed profile while performing the power-split control in respect to the fuel to NOx weighting strategy. Based on the experimental results in a hybrid diesel–electric marine powertrain with a 260 kW diesel engine and a 90 kW electric machine, fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction by 6% and 8.5% respectively, were achieved over the tested profile. In this framework, the capabilities of the energy management system in realistic operation conditions can be exploited and evaluated.",science

Herein, a novel polyamine-modified polyacrylonitrile-based fiber (PANPA) has been synthesized through hydrothermal method, which can validly remove U(VI) from solution. Combined with mesoscopic, spectral characterization and simulation method, the removal behavior and mechanism of U(VI) from high fluorine uranium-containing wastewater by PANPA are systematically investigated. The results show that, based on the strong coordination principle of polyamine group and UO2
                     2+, PANPA can selectively remove U(VI) from wastewater. In addition, the q

More importantly, PANPA is not affected by high concentration of F−, and exhibits higher distribution coefficient (559,900 mL g−1) and removal efficiency (99.5%) to U(VI) than other coexisting ions in real wastewater. Furthermore, the column experiment was also implemented to remove U(VI). The results indicate that PANPA is a promising material to effectively remove U(VI) from real wastewater produced during the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements.",science

Multivariate analyses (PCA and LDA) were performed on the mass spectrometric data, thus creating a powerful model for the discrimination of Curcumalonga and Curcumaxanthorrhiza. Cross-validation of the model revealed correctness-scores of 100% with 20-fold as well as leave-one-out validation techniques. To further estimate the models prediction power, seven retail samples of turmeric powder were analyzed and assorted to a species. Looking for a fast, non-invasive, cost-efficient and laboratory independent method, miniaturized NIR spectrometers offer an alternative for quality control of turmeric species. However, different technologies implemented to compensate for their small size, lead to different applicability of these spectrometers. Therefore, we investigated the three handheld spectrometers microPHAZIR, MicroNIR 2200 and MicroNIR 1700ES for their application in spice analysis in hyphenation to PCA, LDA and ANN methods used for the discriminant analysis. While microPHAZIR proved to be the most valuable device for differentiating C.longa and C.xanthorrhiza, MicroNIR 1700ES offered the worst results. These findings are interpreted on the basis of a quantum chemical simulation of the NIR spectrum of curcumin as the representative constituent. It was found that the information accessible to MicroNIR 1700ES that is relevant to the analyzed constituents is located in the spectral region prone to interferences with the matrix, likely limiting the performance of this spectrometer in this analytical scenario.",science

Determining them by their respective reference methods, however, is laborious, expensive, and time consuming. To overcome this, we developed a new analytical instrument called Solids in Wastewater's Machine Vision-based Automatic Analyzer (SWAMVA), which is equiped with an automatic sampler and a software for real-time digital movie capture to quantify sequentially the TSS and SetS contents in wastewater samples. The machine vision algorithm (MVA) coupled with the Red color plane (derived from color histograms in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) system) showed the best prediction results with R2 of 0.988 and 0.964, and relative error of prediction (REP) of 6.133 and 9.115% for TSS and SetS, respectively. The constructed models were validated by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the accuracy and precision of the predictions by the t- and F-tests, respectively, at a 0.05 significance level. The elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test confirmed the accuracy, while the coefficient of variation (CV) of 6.529 and 10.908% confirmed the good precisions, respectively. Compared with the reference method (Standard Methods For the Examination of Water and Wastewater), the proposed method reduced the analysis volume from 1.5 L to just 15 mL and the analysis time from 12 h to 24 s per sample. Therefore, SWAMVA can be considered an important alternative to the determination of TSS and SetS in wastewater as an automatic, fast, and low-cost analytical tool, following the principles of Green Chemistry and exploiting Industry 4.0 features such as intelligent processing, miniaturization, and machine vision.",science

Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended as the standard test for identifying the SARS-CoV-2, conventional assays are time-consuming. In parallel, although artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to contain the disease, the implementation of AI in PCR analytics, which may enhance the cognition of diagnostics, is quite rare. The information that the amplification curve reveals can reflect the dynamics of reactions. Here, we present a novel AI-aided on-chip approach by integrating deep learning with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs) to detect synthetic RNA templates of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene. The µPADs feature a multilayer structure by which the devices are compatible with conventional PCR instruments. During analysis, real-time PCR data were synchronously fed to three unsupervised learning models with deep neural networks, including RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Of these, the GRU is found to be most effective and accurate. Based on the experimentally obtained datasets, qualitative forecasting can be made as early as 13 cycles, which significantly enhances the efficiency of the PCR tests by 67.5% (∼40 min). Also, an accurate prediction of the end-point value of PCR curves can be obtained by GRU around 20 cycles. To further improve PCR testing efficiency, we also propose AI-aided dynamic evaluation criteria for determining critical cycle numbers, which enables real-time quantitative analysis of PCR tests. The presented approach is the first to integrate AI for on-chip PCR data analysis. It is capable of forecasting the final output and the trend of qPCR in addition to the conventional end-point Cq calculation. It is also capable of fully exploring the dynamics and intrinsic features of each reaction. This work leverages methodologies from diverse disciplines to provide perspectives and insights beyond the scope of a single scientific field.

                  Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 are important diagnostic tools. We assessed clinical performance and ease-of-use of seven Ag-RDTs in a prospective, manufacturer-independent, multi-centre cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to inform global decision makers.
               
                  Methods
                  Unvaccinated participants suspected of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited at six sites (Germany, Brazil). Ag-RDTs were evaluated sequentially, with collection of paired swabs for routine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and Ag-RDT testing. Performance was compared to RT-PCR overall and in sub-group analyses (viral load, symptoms, symptoms duration). To understandusability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.
               
                  Findings
                  7471 participants were included in the analysis. Sensitivities across Ag-RDTs ranged from 70·4%-90·1%, specificities were above 97·2% for all Ag-RDTs but one (93·1%).Ag-RDTs, Mologic, Bionote, Standard Q, showed diagnostic accuracy in line with WHO targets (> 80% sensitivity, > 97% specificity). All tests showed high sensitivity in the first three days after symptom onset (≥87·1%) and in individuals with viral loads≥ 6 log10SARS-CoV2 RNA copies/mL (≥ 88·7%). Usability varied, with Rapigen, Bionote and Standard Q reaching very good scores; 90, 88 and 84/100, respectively.
               
                  Interpretation
                  Variability in test performance is partially explained by variable viral loads in population evaluated over the course of the pandemic. All Ag-RDTs reach high sensitivity early in the disease and in individuals with high viral loads, supporting their role in identifying transmission relevant infections. For easy-to-use tests, performance shown will likely be maintained in routine implementation.

The complexity of these processes and the resulting cognitive load of managing them may vary significantly. To decrease the cognitive load created by such decision-making efforts and to obtain better outcomes, recommendation systems carry significant potential. In order to investigate the benefits provided by decision support systems (DSS) in personal process management (PPM), we first build a constraint programming (CP) model and a prototype context-aware-mobile application employing this CP model. Then, we evaluate the application and the model via two exemplary real-world scenarios. The scenarios form the core of the experiments conducted with 50 participants. We compare the participants’ planning performances with and without the PPM system with quantitative metrics such as planning times and scenario objective values. In addition, System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaires and open-ended questions provide qualitative evaluation results. Throughout the study, we apply the Design Science Research methodology to rigorously conduct research activities by proof of concept, proof of use, and proof of value. The empirical results clearly show that our proposed model for PPM is effective, and the developed prototype solution generates positive participant comments as well as a high SUS score. Overall, the prototype PPM system with CP implementation leads to better planning in less time in the planning phase, and it lets the user do fast replanning in the execution phase, which is invaluable in dynamically changing situations such as daily activities.",science

A common method to deal with such a multi-response predictive modelling is the partial least-squares (PLS2) regression. Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown to outperform partial least-squares (PLS) approaches for single fruit traits prediction. The DL can also be adapted to perform multi-response modelling. This study presents an implementation of DL modelling for multi-response prediction for spectral data of fresh fruit. To show this, a real NIR data set related to SSC and MC measurements in pear fruit was used. Since DL models perform better with larger data sets, a data augmentation procedure was performed prior to data modelling. Furthermore, a comparative study was also performed between two of the most used DL architectures for spectral analysis, their multi-output and single-output variants and a classic baseline model using PLS2. A key point to note that all the DL modelling presented in this study is performed using novel automated optimisation tools such as Bayesian optimisation and Hyperband. The results showed that DL models can be easily adapted by changing the output of the fully connected layers to perform multi-response modelling. In comparison to the PLS2, the multi-response DL model showed ∼13 % lower root mean squared error (RMSE), showing the ease and superiority of handling multi-response by DL models for spectral calibration.",science

Aiming to sustain competitive advantage and intensify customer loyalty, full-service providers offer the use of their products as a service to achieve continuous revenues. For this purpose, companies implement AI classification algorithms to enable high levels of service at controllable costs. However, traditional asset sellers who become service providers require previously atypical payment structures, as classic payment methods involving a one-time fee for production costs and profit margins are unsuitable. In addition, a low predictive power of the implemented classification algorithm can lead to misclassifications, which diminish the achievable level of service and the intended net present value of the resultant service. While previous works focus solely on the costs of such misclassifications, our decision model highlights implications for payment structures, service levels, and – ultimately – the net present value of such data-driven service offerings. Our research suggests that predictive power can be a major factor in selecting a suitable payment structure and the overall design of service level agreements. Therefore, we compare common payment structures for data-driven services and investigate their relationship to predictive power. We develop our model using a design science methodology and iteratively evaluate our results using a four-step approach that includes interviews with industry experts and the application of our model to a real-world use case.
