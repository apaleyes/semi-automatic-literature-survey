Chapter ReferenceWorkEntry,doi:10.1007/978-3-030-42462-6_123,Water 4.0: Enhancing Climate Resilience,The Palgrave Handbook of Climate Resilient Societies,10.1007/978-3-030-42462-6_123,Springer,2021-01-01,2022-01-01,"For this chapter, water 4.0 is defined as the industry 4.0 concept applied to the water sector. As industry 4.0 reflects the fourth industrial revolution , water 4.0 reflects the fourth water revolution . Based on the literature review and case studies, this chapter examines a proposition that water 4.0 will increase not only the sectorâ€™s economic effectiveness but also sustainability including climate resilience. Relevant technologies include digital twins , visualization, wireless monitoring sensors, industrial internet of things (IoT/IIoT), cloud computing, and predictive or prescriptive analytics but also blockchain , drones, and cybersecurity. For water 4.0 becoming a reality, water utility companies need not only collect more data but also to have proper analytical tools in place to convert data into information supporting optimal decisions. The current tools should preferably be replaced by machine learning algorithms that are nonlinear, nonstationary, and dynamic and thus aligned closely with the real world. It has been suggested in this chapter that such disruptive technologies be introduced through an ISO 55001-based asset management system (AMS). ISO 19650 series supplements ISO 55001 and contains additional requirements for the AMS development by focusing particularly on asset information. For this purpose, the series provides assistance with big data and digital twins . Two approaches are applicable to the implementation of water 4.0 through AMS: adaptability and more traditional continuous improvement with the former considered in this chapter as preferred but requires a sufficient level of asset management maturity. Therefore, it might be prudent that every organization sets their own water 4.0 -related standards and objectives in their own AMS and considers the preferred level of adaptability . Adaptability is arguably required for water 4.0 with adaptation bringing the greatest value .",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-42462-6_123,springer,1
