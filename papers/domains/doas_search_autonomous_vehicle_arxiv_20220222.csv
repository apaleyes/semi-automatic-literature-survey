reality replacing traditional traffic signal control. Autonomous intersection
management requires time and speed adjustment of vehicles arriving at an
intersection for collision-free passing through the intersection. Due to its
computational complexity, this problem has been studied only when vehicle
arrival times towards the vicinity of the intersection are known beforehand,
which limits the applicability of these solutions for real-time deployment. To
solve the real-time autonomous traffic intersection management problem, we
propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based multiagent architecture and a novel
RL algorithm coined multi-discount Q-learning. In multi-discount Q-learning, we
introduce a simple yet effective way to solve a Markov Decision Process by
preserving both short-term and long-term goals, which is crucial for
collision-free speed control. Our empirical results show that our RL-based
multiagent solution can achieve near-optimal performance efficiently when
minimizing the travel time through an intersection.",arxiv

  Problems","Gradient-based approaches in reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved
tremendous success in learning policies for continuous control problems. While
the performance of these approaches warrants real-world adoption in domains,
such as in autonomous driving and robotics, these policies lack
interpretability, limiting deployability in safety-critical and
legally-regulated domains. Such domains require interpretable and verifiable
control policies that maintain high performance. We propose Interpretable
Continuous Control Trees (ICCTs), a tree-based model that can be optimized via
modern, gradient-based, RL approaches to produce high-performing, interpretable
policies. The key to our approach is a procedure for allowing direct
optimization in a sparse decision-tree-like representation. We validate ICCTs
against baselines across six domains, showing that ICCTs are capable of
learning interpretable policy representations that parity or outperform
baselines by up to 33$\%$ in autonomous driving scenarios while achieving a
$300$x-$600$x reduction in the number of policy parameters against deep
learning baselines.",arxiv

  Learning Models","Despite our best efforts, deep learning models remain highly vulnerable to
even tiny adversarial perturbations applied to the inputs. The ability to
extract information from solely the output of a machine learning model to craft
adversarial perturbations to black-box models is a practical threat against
real-world systems, such as autonomous cars or machine learning models exposed
as a service (MLaaS). Of particular interest are sparse attacks. The
realization of sparse attacks in black-box models demonstrates that machine
learning models are more vulnerable than we believe. Because these attacks aim
to minimize the number of perturbed pixels measured by l_0 norm-required to
mislead a model by solely observing the decision (the predicted label) returned
to a model query; the so-called decision-based attack setting. But, such an
attack leads to an NP-hard optimization problem. We develop an evolution-based
algorithm-SparseEvo-for the problem and evaluate against both convolutional
deep neural networks and vision transformers. Notably, vision transformers are
yet to be investigated under a decision-based attack setting. SparseEvo
requires significantly fewer model queries than the state-of-the-art sparse
attack Pointwise for both untargeted and targeted attacks. The attack
algorithm, although conceptually simple, is also competitive with only a
limited query budget against the state-of-the-art gradient-based whitebox
attacks in standard computer vision tasks such as ImageNet. Importantly, the
query efficient SparseEvo, along with decision-based attacks, in general, raise
new questions regarding the safety of deployed systems and poses new directions
to study and understand the robustness of machine learning models.",arxiv

  Observation Assertions","ML is being deployed in complex, real-world scenarios where errors have
impactful consequences. In these systems, thorough testing of the ML pipelines
is critical. A key component in ML deployment pipelines is the curation of
labeled training data. Common practice in the ML literature assumes that labels
are the ground truth. However, in our experience in a large autonomous vehicle
development center, we have found that vendors can often provide erroneous
labels, which can lead to downstream safety risks in trained models.
  To address these issues, we propose a new abstraction, learned observation
assertions, and implement it in a system called Fixy. Fixy leverages existing
organizational resources, such as existing (possibly noisy) labeled datasets or
previously trained ML models, to learn a probabilistic model for finding errors
in human- or model-generated labels. Given user-provided features and these
existing resources, Fixy learns feature distributions that specify likely and
unlikely values (e.g., that a speed of 30mph is likely but 300mph is unlikely).
It then uses these feature distributions to score labels for potential errors.
We show that FIxy can automatically rank potential errors in real datasets with
up to 2$\times$ higher precision compared to recent work on model assertions
and standard techniques such as uncertainty sampling.",arxiv

aerial vehicles (UAVs) has the potential for advancing autonomous object
geolocation performance. Much research has focused on algorithmic improvements
on individual components, such as navigation, motion planning, and perception.
In this paper, we present a UGV-UAV object detection and geolocation system,
which performs perception, navigation, and planning autonomously in real scale
in unstructured environment. We designed novel sensor pods equipped with
multispectral (visible, near-infrared, thermal), high resolution (181.6 Mega
Pixels), stereo (near-infrared pair), wide field of view (192 degree HFOV)
array. We developed a novel on-board software-hardware architecture to process
the high volume sensor data in real-time, and we built a custom AI subsystem
composed of detection, tracking, navigation, and planning for autonomous
objects geolocation in real-time.
  This research is the first real scale demonstration of such high speed data
processing capability. Our novel modular sensor pod can boost relevant computer
vision and machine learning research. Our novel hardware-software architecture
is a solid foundation for system-level and component-level research. Our system
is validated through data-driven offline tests as well as a series of field
tests in unstructured environments. We present quantitative results as well as
discussions on key robotic system level challenges which manifest when we build
and test the system. This system is the first step toward a UGV-UAV cooperative
reconnaissance system in the future.",arxiv
