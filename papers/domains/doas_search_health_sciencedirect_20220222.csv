Due to the MZI sensitivity being a composite of strain sensitive and temperature sensitive contributions, the MZI gives an instantaneous response to a quench (within 10 ms), because of the quick strain transfer to the optical fibre. However, the MZI output signal can also manifest the environmental noise caused by mechanical vibrations, bubbling in the cryostat and temperature variations, along with the response to the quench. This presents the problems of false alarms and indiscernible response to a quench. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been proven to be a useful tool for feature extraction in different fields requiring signal categorization and hence holds the potential to enable quench recognition in the MZI output. This paper proposes an effective approach of performing DWT based feature extraction on experimental data and subsequently using the extracted features for the MZI response classification using two machine learning based classification techniques: k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). For this manuscript, experiments were performed using MZI for quench detection in an HTS tape. Feature extraction was then implemented on these experimental measurements using discrete wavelet coefficients extracted at different decomposition levels from the MZI output; these features were then used to train the KNN and ANN models for identifying quench in the MZI signal. This method could be a valuable supplement to the MZI technique by enabling the development of a real time application that can process the MZI output data as well as eliminate the occurrences of false alarms; thereby facilitating reliable quench detection. With this development, the MZI technique would become an even more attractive solution for the health monitoring of HTS applications.",health

In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), most ML-enabled IDS approaches use centralized approaches where IoT devices share their data with data centers for further analysis. To mitigate privacy concerns associated with centralized approaches, in recent years the use of Federated Learning (FL) has attracted a significant interest in different sectors, including healthcare and transport systems. However, the development of FL-enabled IDS for IoT is in its infancy, and still requires research efforts from various areas, in order to identify the main challenges for the deployment in real-world scenarios. In this direction, our work evaluates a FL-enabled IDS approach based on a multiclass classifier considering different data distributions for the detection of different attacks in an IoT scenario. In particular, we use three different settings that are obtained by partitioning the recent ToN_IoT dataset according to IoT devices’ IP address and types of attack. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different aggregation functions according to such setting by using the recent IBMFL framework as FL implementation. Additionally, we identify a set of challenges and future directions based on the existing literature and the analysis of our evaluation results.",health

There are a variety of techniques and algorithms that can be deployed to address each aspect. To date, most review papers have concentrated on steady-state and single-phase flow conditions. The goal of the current review is therefore to carry out a thorough analysis of the available leak detection and diagnosis methods by focusing on (i) multiphase flow and transient flow conditions, (ii) model-based and data-driven techniques, (iii) prediction tools, and (iv) performance measures. Detailed assessment of leak detection methods based on accuracy, complexity, data requirement, and cost of installation are discussed. Data-driven techniques are utterly dependent on qualitative and quantitative data available from pipeline systems. Contrastingly data-driven techniques, model-based techniques require less data to achieve leak detection, provided that a nearly accurate base model is available. Different methodologies and technologies can be combined in order to produce the best detection and diagnosis outputs. In many cases, statistical analysis was combined with the Real Time Transient Method (RTTM), which helped to minimize false alarms. The material in this review can be used as a robust guide for the design of diagnostic systems and further research.",health

An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.",health

Domain generalization (DG), which aims to learn a model from multiple source domains such that it can be directly generalized to unseen test domains, seems particularly promising to medical imaging community. To address DG, recent model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has been introduced, which transfers the knowledge from previous training tasks to facilitate the learning of novel testing tasks. However, in clinical practice, there are usually only a few annotated source domains available, which decreases the capacity of training task generation and thus increases the risk of overfitting to training tasks in the paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel DG scheme of episodic training with task augmentation on medical imaging classification. Based on meta-learning, we develop the paradigm of episodic training to construct the knowledge transfer from episodic training-task simulation to the real testing task of DG. Motivated by the limited number of source domains in real-world medical deployment, we consider the unique task-level overfitting and we propose task augmentation to enhance the variety during training task generation to alleviate it. With the established learning framework, we further exploit a novel meta-objective to regularize the deep embedding of training domains. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments on histopathological images and abdominal CT images.",health

                  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) conducted an external quality assessment (EQA) survey of pathogen nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) as a TMG EQA program for SARS-CoV-2 for clinical laboratories in Tokyo.
               
                  Methods
                  We diluted and prepared a standard product manufactured by Company A to about 2,500 copies/mL to make a positive control and distribute it with a negative control. The participants reported the use of the NAATs methods for SARS-CoV-2, the name of the real-time RT-PCR kit, the name of the detection device, the target gene(s), nucleic acid extraction kit, Threshold Cycle value in the case of RT-PCR and the Threshold time value and Differential calculation value in the case of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) method.
               
                  Results
                  As a result, 17 laboratories using fully automated equipment and 34 laboratories using the RT-PCR method reported generally appropriate results in this EQA survey. On the other hand, among the laboratories that adopted the LAMP method, there were a plurality of laboratories that judged positive samples to be negative.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The false negative result is considered to be due to the fact that the amount of virus genome contained in the quality control reagent used this time was below the detection limit of the LAMP method combined with the rapid extraction reagent for influenza virus. On the other hand, false positive results are considered to be due to the non-specific reaction of the NAATs. The EQA program must be continued for the proper implementation of the pathogen NAATs.",health

However, less focus has been paid to their security against cyber-threats in the implementation of the IoMT and its networks. One of the key reasons can be the challenging task of optimizing typical security solutions to the IoMT networks. And despite the rising admiration of machine learning and deep learning methods in the cyber-security domain (e.g., a threat detection system), most of these methods are acknowledged as a black-box model. The explainable AI (XAI) has become progressively vital to understand the employed learning models to improve trust level and empower security experts to interpret the prediction decisions. The authors propose a highly efficient model named XSRU-IoMT, for effective and timely detection of sophisticated attack vectors in IoMT networks. The proposed model is developed using novel bidirectional simple recurrent units (SRU) using the phenomenon of skip connections to eradicate the vanishing gradient problem and achieve a fast training process in recurrent networks. We also explore the concepts of XAI to improve trust level by providing explanations of the predictive decisions and enabling humans and security experts to understand the causal reasoning and underlying data evidence. The evaluation results on the ToN_IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed XSRU-IoMT model as compared to the state-of-the-art compelling detection models, suggesting its usefulness as a viable deployment model in real-IoMT networks.",health

                  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was responsible for the death of millions of people around the world, which accelerated the study of vaccines. The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 is a messenger RNA vaccine that encodes the spike protein of the virus. However, the duration of the protection conferred by this vaccine and factors associated with immune responses require validation in large cohorts.
               
                  Methods
                  Here, we present data of humoral immune response to vaccination in4264 healthcare workers, tested before (T0) and 15 and 90 days (T1 and T2, respectively) following vaccination.Peripheral blood was collected for immunological analysis using the Quant SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) to determine anti-spike IgG, receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2.
               
                  Findings
                  At T0, 96·8% (n = 4129) of participants had IgG antibodies non-reactive to anti-SARS-CoV-2. Fifteen days after completing the vaccination, the IgG overall median titer was significantly elevated (21·7x103
                     AU/mL). Both for uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses women presented higher antibody levels than men, independent of age. Titers were significantly altered among age groups, decreasing by each increase in 10-year of age. At 3 months after completing the vaccination, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were 6·3-fold diminished.
                  This real-world post-vaccination data confirmed production of a frequent and elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers, associated with high protection rates. Females and younger participants had higher titer 15 days after vaccination, and despite the significant reduction from 15-to-90 days, those with higher pre-vaccination titers maintained higher levels throughout the remaining timepoints.
               
                  Interpretation
                  These findings support the need to track humoral immunity kinetics to uncover viral susceptibility and eventually implement re-vaccination, particularly in groups prone to lower humoral immune response.

Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended as the standard test for identifying the SARS-CoV-2, conventional assays are time-consuming. In parallel, although artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to contain the disease, the implementation of AI in PCR analytics, which may enhance the cognition of diagnostics, is quite rare. The information that the amplification curve reveals can reflect the dynamics of reactions. Here, we present a novel AI-aided on-chip approach by integrating deep learning with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs) to detect synthetic RNA templates of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene. The µPADs feature a multilayer structure by which the devices are compatible with conventional PCR instruments. During analysis, real-time PCR data were synchronously fed to three unsupervised learning models with deep neural networks, including RNN, LSTM, and GRU. Of these, the GRU is found to be most effective and accurate. Based on the experimentally obtained datasets, qualitative forecasting can be made as early as 13 cycles, which significantly enhances the efficiency of the PCR tests by 67.5% (∼40 min). Also, an accurate prediction of the end-point value of PCR curves can be obtained by GRU around 20 cycles. To further improve PCR testing efficiency, we also propose AI-aided dynamic evaluation criteria for determining critical cycle numbers, which enables real-time quantitative analysis of PCR tests. The presented approach is the first to integrate AI for on-chip PCR data analysis. It is capable of forecasting the final output and the trend of qPCR in addition to the conventional end-point Cq calculation.

Using a Red-Green-Blue-Depth (RGBD) camera, images of feed piles of two different feed types (lactating cows' feed and heifers' feed) were acquired in a research dairy farm, for a range of feed weights under varied configurations and illuminations. Several models were developed to predict individual feed intake: two Transfer Learning (TL) models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one CNN model trained on both feed types, and one Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network model trained on both feed types, along with categorical data. We also implemented a statistical method to compare these four models using a Linear Mixed Model and a Generalised Linear Mixed Model, showing that all models are significantly different. The TL models performed best and were trained on both feeds with TL methods. These models achieved Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) of 0.12 and 0.13 kg per meal with RMSE of 0.18 and 0.17 kg per meal for the two different feeds, when tested on varied data collected manually in a cowshed. Testing the model with actual cows’ meals data automatically collected by the system in the cowshed resulted in a MAE of 0.14 kg per meal and RMSE of 0.19 kg per meal.

Usability varied, with Rapigen, Bionote and Standard Q reaching very good scores; 90, 88 and 84/100, respectively.
               
                  Interpretation
                  Variability in test performance is partially explained by variable viral loads in population evaluated over the course of the pandemic. All Ag-RDTs reach high sensitivity early in the disease and in individuals with high viral loads, supporting their role in identifying transmission relevant infections. For easy-to-use tests, performance shown will likely be maintained in routine implementation.

Faster and more accurate laboratory testing aids in the prescription of appropriate treatment for children suspected of having pneumonia, lowering mortality. In this work, we implement a deep neural network model to efficiently evaluate pediatric pneumonia from chest radio graph images. Our network uses a combination of convolutional and capsule layers to capture abstract details as well as low level hidden features from the radio graphic images, allowing the model to generate more generic predictions. Furthermore, we employ transfer learning approach to extract spatial features from the raw input radio graph images, allowing the model to save resources while enhancing performance. The capsule layer weights of the network are updated using the dynamic routing algorithm. The proposed model is evaluated using benchmark pneumonia dataset Kermany et al. 2018, and the outcomes of our experimental studies indicate that the capsules employed in the network enhance the learning of disease level features that are essential in diagnosing pneumonia. According to our comparison studies, the proposed model with Convolution base from InceptionV3 attached with Capsule layers at the end surpasses several existing models by achieving an accuracy of 94.84%. The proposed model is superior in terms of various performance measures such as accuracy and recall, and is well suited to real-time pediatric pneumonia diagnosis, substituting manual chest radiography examination.",health

                  Histopathological assessment of transplant biopsies is currently the standard method to diagnose allograft rejection and can help guide patient management, but it is one of the most challenging areas of pathology, requiring considerable expertise, time, and effort. We aimed to analyse the utility of deep learning to preclassify histology of kidney allograft biopsies into three main broad categories (ie, normal, rejection, and other diseases) as a potential biopsy triage system focusing on transplant rejection.
               
                  Methods
                  We performed a retrospective, multicentre, proof-of-concept study using 5844 digital whole slide images of kidney allograft biopsies from 1948 patients. Kidney allograft biopsy samples were identified by a database search in the Departments of Pathology of the Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands (1130 patients) and the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands (717 patients). 101 consecutive kidney transplant biopsies were identified in the archive of the Institute of Pathology, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to classify allograft biopsies as normal, rejection, or other diseases. Three times cross-validation (1847 patients) and deployment on an external real-world cohort (101 patients) were used for validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used as the main performance metric (the primary endpoint to assess CNN performance).
               
                  Findings
                  Serial CNNs, first classifying kidney allograft biopsies as normal (AUROC 0·87 [ten times bootstrapped CI 0·85–0·88]) and disease (0·87 [0·86–0·88]), followed by a second CNN classifying biopsies classified as disease into rejection (0·75 [0·73–0·76]) and other diseases (0·75 [0·72–0·77]), showed similar AUROC in cross-validation and deployment on independent real-world data (first CNN normal AUROC 0·83 [0·80–0·85], disease 0·83 [0·73–0·91]; second CNN rejection 0·61 [0·51–0·70], other diseases 0·61 [0·50–0·74]). A single CNN classifying biopsies as normal, rejection, or other diseases showed similar performance in cross-validation (normal AUROC 0·80 [0·73–0·84], rejection 0·76 [0·66–0·80], other diseases 0·50 [0·36–0·57]) and generalised well for normal and rejection classes in the real-world data. Visualisation techniques highlighted rejection-relevant areas of biopsies in the tubulointerstitium.
               
                  Interpretation
                  This study showed that deep learning-based classification of transplant biopsies could support pathological diagnostics of kidney allograft rejection.

These disorders decrease worker's productivity, impact industries economically, and cause serious psycho-physical conditions. However, technological advances have leveraged the industry to a novel phase where digitalization and automation provide a new reality. Hence, this industrial transformation may contribute to assists human beings in the workplace with a focus on mental health. This article presents a systematic literature review to investigate studies regarding technologies employed in the care of worker's mental health and the industrial role in this scenario. Three general, three focused, and three descriptive questions highlight the academic progress of industrial concern on mental health, implemented systems and cases, and research challenges. As a result, the review discussed 31 studies, extracted from an initial corpus of 25269, ranging from January 2010 to November 2020. The studies approached stress as the most frequent mental issue in the industry and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the most used machine learning algorithm, where biomarkers presented the primary data extractors to deal with this theme. Moreover, information fusion methods improved the accuracy of specific cases. However, a growing interest in mental health care has emerged only in recent years, and several challenges require efforts before applying systems in real industrial environments.",health

Segmentation and volume regeneration of the thyroid is particularly important for identifying thyroid-related diseases since the majority of these problems result in a change in the thyroid’s shape and scale over time. There is an urgent need for research on the disease’s origins and spread. The Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence all provide real-time processing for a variety of applications in the healthcare sector. In healthcare and biomedicine applications, machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized to make critical choices. Thyroid patients urgently need a robust and latency-sensitive Quality of Service framework. This paper aims to integrate fog computing and artificial intelligence with smart health to provide a dependable platform for thyroid infection early detection. To identify thyroid patients, a novel ensemble-based classifier is proposed. The thyroid dataset is obtained from the UCI library and the simulation is carried out utilizing Python programming. To increase the framework’s security, encryption and decryption methods are suggested. The suggested framework’s performance is assessed in terms of latency, network use, RAM utilization, and energy consumption. On the other side, the suggested classifier’s accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and F1 score are all assessed. The result demonstrates that the suggested framework and classifier perform consistently better than conventional frameworks and classifiers.",health

In this work, we develop a new segmentation application based on various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for Ultrasonic Computed Tomographic (USCT) images. To evaluate the proposed segmentation system, we use different state-of-the-art models for better segmentation performances to train and test the suggested system. We ensure in this work a USCT data augmentation technique based on the Haar wavelet transform and the improved k-means algorithms. Thus, we offer a free dataset for USCT researchers. Moreover, the proposed CNN system is trained and tested using the networks of Adadelta and Adam optimizers. The whole system is implemented on a CPU and a GPU for complexity analysis. High segmentation accuracy has been achieved using the Adadelta optimizer, reaching 99.24%, 99.19%, 99.13% and 99.10% for VGG-Segnet, VGG-Unet, Fully CNN (FCN)-8 and FCN-32 models, respectively. To obtain better results, we use the Adam optimizer to train and test different architectures, and we obtain more competitive results attaining 99.55%, 99.31%, 99.35% and 99.45% for VGG-Segnet, VGG-Unet, FCN-8 and FCN-32, respectively. The achieved results outperform the state of the art in terms of accuracy and time speed up. Moreover, our proposed CNN segmentation confirms the low computational complexity of the system. In addition, our system proves to be a good candidate for medical real-time applications thanks to its implementation on the GPU.",health
