10.1109/SBESC49506.2019.9046078,A Linked Data-Based Semantic Information Model for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"Smart cities typically involve a myriad of inter-connected systems intended to promote better management of urban and natural resources of cities, thereby contributing to the improve the quality of life of citizens. The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection. This paper also presents an implementation of LGeoSIM within Smart Geo Layers, a geographic-layered data middleware platform conceived to integrate data provided by heterogeneous sources in a smart city environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9046078/,2019 IX Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering (SBESC),19-22 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/MSM49833.2020.9201644,A Preliminary Investigation of an Autonomous Vehicle Validation Infrastructure for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI). A preliminary investigation of a new autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure that can serve a multitude of research projects for smart city is presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201644/,2020 International Conference Mechatronic Systems and Materials (MSM),1-3 July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ISC2.2017.8090817,A predictive policing application to support patrol planning in smart cities,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently, patrol planning and other predictive policing strategies were improved for Smart Cities applications. In such public safety context, some police departments have been recording crime events in their databases to compose better strategies to understand and predict crime incidence. This work presents the ROTA-Analytics, a web-based application which aims to provide crime incidence forecasting as outputs. This crime incident forecasting helps patrol supervisors to elaborate the list of predefined locations (points) and staying time at which each police vehicle must patrol. ROTA-Analytics supports multiple machine and statistical learning methods selection to create an environment of crime prediction in different areas of the city.

Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated. The use cases are then evaluated based on the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The scope for future directions and conclusions are sketched towards the end, with an optimism that the current work will be an eye-opener and adaptable to other developing countries.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9183832/,"2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)",6-7 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547185/,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB),4-6 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

These systems can be thought of as the cities' vision organs. It is anticipated that smart cities will produce a massive amount of data. Thus, to ensure the safety of its people, it is essential to conduct an efficient and real-time analysis of these data in order to receive timely responses in the event of catastrophic incidents. As a result, the process of transferring this vast data to the cloud for processing is relatively slow. In this paper, we present the software perspective to design and implement EFISS, a multilayer computing-based architecture for an intelligent, resource-efficient, and real-time surveillance system for smart cities. The framework, which is comprised of edge-fog computational layers, would help in the prevention of crime and the prediction of criminal incidents in smart cities.

In this paper, we study two research problems to maximize the overall Quality-of-Service (QoS) level of all IoT analytics that run on both data center servers and gateways. The first problem is to select additional IoT analytics to deploy on a gateway to save upload bandwidth due to transmitting raw sensor data. The second problem is to allocate the residue upload bandwidth among all IoT analytics to maximize the overall QoS level. We propose several algorithms to solve these two research problems.

The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree.

Furthermore, there is a good concern in expanding the scope of application in the smart city. The primary objective of the smart city is to achieve optimization and reinforce the Quality of Service (QoS) of applications by cleverer usage of urban resources. The QoS in the network is measured using several factors like end-end delay, energy consumption, packet loss and throughput. Several pitfalls are experienced in the existing routing innovation. In this proposal, a new technology-based routing structure is proposed. Road Side Units (RSU) will allow the planners to deploy the application without unfamiliar tools for data process and gathering. Data forwarding, acquisition and diffusion are simplified by RSU. K-Nearest Neighbor is used for finding the nearest neighbor nodes and it is optimized using Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA).

10.1109/JIOT.2021.3079304,MEC-Enabled Hierarchical Emotion Recognition and Perturbation-Aware Defense in Smart Cities,IEEE,Journals,"With the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and various emerging network technologies, IoT-enabled smart cities are further refined into health smart cities. For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9427992/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Dec.1, 2021",ieeexplore

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects.

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications.

They will (i) aggregate data from in-vehicle and infrastructure sensors; (ii) process the data by taking advantage of low-latency high-bandwidth communications, edge-cloud computing, and AI-based detection and tracking of objects; and (iii) provide intelligent feedback and input to control systems. The Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment (COSMOS) enables research on technologies supporting smart cities. In this paper, we provide results of experiments using bird's eye cameras to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians from the COSMOS pilot site. We assess the capabilities for real-time computation, and detection and tracking accuracy - by evaluating and customizing a selection of video pre-processing and deep-learning algorithms. Distinct issues that are associated with the difference in scale for bird's eye view of pedestrians vs. cars are explored and addressed: the best multiple-object tracking accuracies (MOTA) for cars are around 73.2, and around 2.8 for pedestrians.

10.1109/ETSecIoT50046.2020.00005,Progressive Monitoring of IoT Networks Using SDN and Cost-Effective Traffic Signatures,IEEE,Conferences,"IoT networks continue to expand in various domains, from smart homes and campuses to smart cities and critical infrastructures. It has been shown that IoT devices typically lack appropriate security measures embedded, and hence are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Also, these devices are heterogeneous in their network communications that makes it difficult for operators of smart environments to manage them at scale. Existing monitoring solutions may perform well in certain environments, however, they do not scale cost-effectively and are inflexible to changes due to their static use of models. In this paper<sup>1</sup>, we use SDN to dynamically monitor a selected portion of IoT packets or flows, and develop specialized models to learn corresponding traffic signatures. Our first contribution develops a progressive inference pipeline, comprising a number of machine-learning models each is specialized in certain features of IoT traffic. Our inference engine dynamically obtains selected telemetry, including a subset of traffic or flow counters, using SDN techniques. Our second contribution develops three supervised multi-class classifiers, two are protocol specialists trained by packet-based features and one is flow-based model trained by behavioral characteristics of ten unidirectional flows. Our third contribution evaluates the performance of our scheme by replaying real traffic traces of 26 IoT devices on to an SDN switching simulator in conjunction with three trained Random Forest models. Our system yields an overall accuracy of 99.4%. We also integrate our system with an off-the-shelf IDS (Zeek) to flag TCP flood and reflection attacks by inspecting only the suspicious device network traffic.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9097761/,2020 Workshop on Emerging Technologies for Security in IoT (ETSecIoT),21-21 April 2020,ieeexplore

In particular, real-time object recognition has become an important technology in smart cities. To achieve this, low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are the key technologies. In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, it has not been considered to increase the batch size of arrival data at edge servers ensuring low-latency transmission. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via TWDM-PONe We also propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrival at the edge.

However, the heterogeneity among connected objects (i.e., things) and the unreliable nature of their associated services may prevent IoT from playing this crucial role. To enable the possibility of dynamically (re-)configuring real world objects at run-time, we propose to represent them as Virtual Objects (VOs). VOs are semantic descriptions of physical objects and of the phenomena they observe and include software modules to expose the object functionalities as IoT services. In order to provide self configuration functionality at VO level, we propose to use a cognitive management framework that wisely tunes key application parameters.

The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management.

However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152145/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,July 2021,ieeexplore

For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests. Then based on the analysis results, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) scheme is designed with multiobjective optimization.

To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities.

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9127904/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal.

Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state.

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards.

In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste.

The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition.

In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions.

TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services.

We identify 15 atomic services addressing smart city challenges in data analytics, data evaluation, data integration, data validation, and visualization. Thirty-eight instances of the atomic services are already operational in several smart city services. We detail in this article, as atomic service examples, some data predictor components. Furthermore, we describe real-world atomic services usage in the scenarios of Santander and three Danish cities.

The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection.

While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI).

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated.

10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223311,Blockchain framework for real-time streaming data generated in image sensor networks for smart monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"The smart city concept is attracting increasing attention from society. Smart monitoring, which enables the detection and prevention of road traffic accidents, is one promising application of the smart city concept. The deployment of three-dimensional (3D) image sensor networks formed by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices interconnected via a network is a key enabler for smart monitoring. Data collected by image sensor networks for smart monitoring are sensitive because the usage of the data is often related to public safety or law enforcement. Managing sensor data using the blockchain technology is one way to address these sensitivity concerns, as a blockchain network helps prevent data from being tampered with even by the administrators of the system. However, prior works have not considered how to handle streaming data such as image sensor data generated by LIDAR devices in real-time, which means there is a risk of overflow in the network if the data are handled frame by frame. In response to this issue, we propose a blockchain framework for real-time monitoring in a smart city using image sensor networks. Our key concept with this framework is to aggregate hash values converted from multiple frames of image sensor data into one hash value. The proposed framework reduces the number of data `writes' on a blockchain network, thus preventing any overflow. Our framework also enables the estimation of the optimal number of aggregated hash values that minimizes delay while avoiding overflow. Measurements taken in actual environments using a real-world LIDAR dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223311/,2020 2nd Conference on Blockchain Research & Applications for Innovative Networks and Services (BRAINS),28-30 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed.

As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system. By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic. In addition, we considered many constraints/rules for traffic light control in the real world, and integrate these constraints in the learning algorithm, which can facilitate the proposed solution to be deployed in real operational scenarios. We conducted numerical simulations for a real-world map with real-world traffic data. The simulation results show that our proposed solution outperforms existing solutions in terms of vehicle and pedestrian queue lengths, waiting time at intersections, and many other key performance metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8317730/,2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),16-19 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties.

However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services. Inspired by the human eye, PDSProxy++ is based on a central cone (foveal vision) and a surrounding smaller circle (peripheral vision), which determine the nearby IoT devices to be initialized.

10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.000-6,Real-Time Traffic Estimation of Unmonitored Roads,IEEE,Conferences,"Due to growing cities, the real-time knowledge about the state of traffic is a critical problem for urban mobility and the road-segments traffic densities estimation influences the efficiency of fundamental smart city services as smart routing, smart planning for evacuations, planning of civil works on the city, etc. Nevertheless, the traffic-related data from navigator Apps (e.g., TomTom, Google, Bing) are too expensive to be acquired. Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00051,Smart Energy Management System based on Reconfigurable AI Chip and Electrical Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

The IoT paradigm, enhanced with intelligence and big data analytics, has found applications in a wide range of solutions such as smart home, smart city, industrial IoT etc. Even though IoT implies that cheap motes can conduct a specific task, thus a large number of them can be deployed, we aim to minimize the installed hardware while we still have a high level of quality of service. Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions. In this paper, we propose a concept of an IoT testbed which allows virtual IoT resources to be immersed and tested in real life conditions, which are met in everyday life. Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed while taking into account specific use cases, regarding luminosity scenarios in industrial environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804746/,2019 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS),29-31 May 2019,ieeexplore

However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146646/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS).

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9046847/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification.

Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized.

Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods.

Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced. Firstly, the value function is approximated by a neural network. Then the parameters are optimized by the policy iteration method, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative error toward set-point. Furthermore, the optimal control law constrained by a saturated operator is implemented based on real-time observations recursively. The neuro-dynamic controller is tested for the two-regional MFD system.

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques.

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city. In addition the networks have been implemented on an embedded GPU platform to investigate the real-time capability of the presented approach. The networks were configured and trained to predict five seconds into the future with a sample time of 0.2 s. The results of each network are presented and compared against each other.

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

To tackle this problem, we propose an alternative approach in this paper. We first generate low-dimensional representation of the network, leveraging on the column-based (CX) decomposition of matrices. The low-dimensional model represents the large network in terms of a small subset of road segments. The future state of the low-dimensional network is predicted by standard procedures, i.e., support vector regression.

In the proposed multi-level feature alignment method, we first translate images from one domain to another one. Then the discriminative feature representations extracted by the deep neural network are concatenated, followed by domain adversarial learning to make the intermediate feature distribution of the target domain images close to those in the source domain.

Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling.

Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and AI techniques to detect the presence of RPAS. Preliminary results show promise for this agile IoT method as a key solution to this emerging urban challenge.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804735/,2019 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS),29-31 May 2019,ieeexplore

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9239014/,2020 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2),28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

Therefore, as the first step towards the goal of thorough understanding of the phenomena, pervasive urban sensing have become a cornerstone of future smart city that enhance the interplay between the cyber space and the physical world. We introduce a taxi-based pervasive urban sensing system and its key algorithm, aiming at the quantitative study of the correlation between human activities and environmental changes. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose an urban crowd-sourcing framework that take automobiles as participatory mobile agents to the sensing tasks, and implemented a prototype in Beijing. Second, we design a Spatial-Temporal Manifold Learning (STML) algorithm to analyse the correlation between physical processes. Based on noisy and partially labelled dataset that are collected by pervasive urban sensor networks, we evaluate STML's performance by analysing correlation between the traffic density and the air quality.

Traditional water-level sensors for large-scale river can detect water-level rising, though they have limitations in detecting urban river dyke height to alert about flooding. This is a result of various riverside environmental limitations. Additionally, previous prediction methods are difficult to detect CWF flooding with high accuracy because water rising differ depends on a location's environment. Therefore, we propose a detection scheme for CWF by developing a water-level sensor system that works in various installation environments using infrared image processing with both low installation and operation cost. We implemented a CWF prediction system that produces accurate and early predictions using a Linear Regression (LR) of deep learning approach with data assimilation. Evaluating based on actual installations (over 1,000 days, 13 locations), our system proved to accurately monitor and predict water-level rising after 5 minutes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7808626/,2016 IEEE SENSORS,30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore

10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00041,Graph CNNs for Urban Traffic Passenger Flows Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic passenger flows prediction has always been a great challenge in transportation field. Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy. Finally we evaluate our model with the real Beijing subway data and compare with other traditional models on short-term passenger flows prediction tasks. Experiments show that our model including multidimensional flows graph matrices and the deep learning model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8560019/,"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)",8-12 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore

However, it is non-trivial to evaluate a new transit plan, such as a new bus route or a new subway line, of its future ridership prior to actual deployment, since the travel preferences of passengers along the planned routes may vary. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model passengers' preferences of making various transit choices using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Moreover, we develop a novel inverse preference learning algorithm to infer the passengers' preferences and predict the future human behavior changes, e.g., ridership, of a new urban transit plan before its deployment. We validate our proposed framework using a unique real-world dataset (from Shenzhen, China) with three subway lines opened during the data time span. With the data collected from both before and after the transit plan deployments, Our evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed framework can predict the ridership with only 19.8% relative error, which is 23%-51% lower than other baseline approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594879/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

In addition, our approach is a dynamic modeling method because the learned BN structure will change in different time periods depends on the different service that the city provides. With structural leaning and real time monitoring, we perform Bayesian inference on the BN structure and the transformation of BN structure.

Both of them involve transmitters and receivers less than 10 m high inducing a more complex urban environment. This paper presents a framework of integrating composite urban furniture, e.g., traffic signs, traffic lights, etc., into ray-tracing tools. The framework starts with the theoretical modeling for radar cross section of furniture components and validation of full-wave analysis simulation in the far field. Then, in order to locally fulfill the far field condition in the small cells or D2D scenarios, the furniture is divided into small segments so that the models in the far field are still applicable. Finally, the decomposed furniture is implemented in a ray-tracing tool and validated by measurements in real scenarios. Under this framework, researchers can improve the ray-tracing tools with more essential elements of urban environment. Last but not least, this paper provides a case study to demonstrate the implementation of the framework, and the results show that the traffic signs indeed influence the vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which is one of the most frequently occurring applications of outdoor D2D systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7481737/,2016 10th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP),10-15 April 2016,ieeexplore

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP).

Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes.

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows.

Based on the algorithm structure, two practical travel time prediction algorithms, called as Space Discretization Travel Time Calculation Algorithm (SDTCM) and Speed Integral Travel Time Calculation Method (SITCM), were developed by the discretization of the space and integral of the predicted speed. Vehicle plate recognition technology was used to collect the real travel time data in the test section on Beijing Third-Ring urban expressway to evaluate the algorithms. The obtained results show that the average prediction error of two algorithms are both less than 10% which can meet the requirement of the field applications and the algorithms are easy to be implemented as no travel time data collection are needed in advance.

Aerial BS has the advantage of providing flexible communication range by avoiding obstacles such as buildings in urban areas through 3D positioning. However, finding an optimal point for aerial BS considering the variance of user's requirements, movement, and obstacles in real time is difficult problem to solve. Therefore, it is necessary to find an approximate optimal point for applying to the real-time flight path control of aerial BS.

This needs to be supported by an IoT cyber-infrastructure for reliable and scalable data acquisition from the edge to the Cloud. The low accuracy of such sensors also motivates the need for data-driven calibration models that can accurately predict the science variables from the raw sensor signals. Here, we offer our experiences with designing and deploying such an IoT software platform and calibration models, and validate it through a pilot field deployment at two mega-cities, Delhi and Mumbai. Our edge data service is able to even-out the differential bandwidths from the sensing devices and to the Cloud repository, and recover from transient failures.

10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966128,Scalable deep traffic flow neural networks for urban traffic congestion prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Tracking congestion throughout the network road is a critical component of Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California. Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful congestion prediction.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7966128/,2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),14-19 May 2017,ieeexplore

Therefore, the consensus notion, extensively investigated in multi-agent networks, is introduced in traffic control, and the steady-state signal control approach is presented, the idea behind which is that traffic states in network links asymptotically converge to given steady-state values, implying balanced distribution of traffic flows is realized. A signal control model of the network is first proposed, which is a linear time-varying system with discharging proportions of internal network links as control variables. Furthermore, analytic relation between steady-state values and inputs of the network is established based on matrix theory, based on which the steady-state signal control law is provided, balancing time-varying traffic flows in the network.

10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575140,Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS): A fully probabilistic 3D tracking approach based on 2D detections,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS) is a surveillance system based on a monocular and calibrated video camera that detects vehicles in an urban traffic scenario with dense traffic on multiple lanes and vehicles performing sharp turning maneuvers. UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation.

Offsets are calculated by the real-time average speeds. The control layer determines phase composition and adjusts splits at the end of each cycle. The target of this control strategy is to maximize the possibility for vehicles in each direction along the arterial road to pass the local intersection without stop while the utility efficiency of the green signal time is at relatively high level.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas. Finally, we optimise this context-aware proactive load balancing strategy by forecasting the best activation time. This paper represents one of the first works to couple the real-world urban event detection with proactive load balancing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8951163/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

A rolling spatial interval is used to identify the existence of an on-street parking space and the properties of empty spaces are used to determine the availability of the parking space. Convolutional neural networks are developed, trained, and evaluated with the use of images from a moving vehicle camera. The images are preprocessed and converted to suitable matrices, so that only the useful information for the empty on-street parking space detection problem is preserved. The optimized convolutional networks, in terms of structural and learning parameters, provided predictions for the detection of empty on-street parking spaces with approximately 90% average accuracy. The proposed model performs better than the relatively complex SVMs, which supports its appropriateness as an approach.

Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic passenger flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban traffic passenger flows in different transportation lines, a more efficient and fine-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model the passenger flows among different traffic lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical traffic data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of traffic passenger flows datasets including subway, taxi and bus flows in Beijing as well as bike flows in New York.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in CO<sub>x</sub> sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2442584,Estimation of Seismic Vulnerability Levels of Urban Structures With Multisensor Remote Sensing,IEEE,Journals,"The ongoing global transformation of human habitats from rural villages to ever growing urban agglomerations induces unprecedented seismic risks in earthquake prone regions. To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ &gt; 0.6 up to κ &gt; 0.8). Overall, analyzes provide very promising empirical evidence, which confirms the potential of remote sensing to support seismic vulnerability assessment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150321/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,May 2016,ieeexplore

Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities.

However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data. Second, corresponding algorithms have been implemented on a low-power wireless sensor platform, and their performance in water level estimation in a six months test involving four different sensors is illustrated.

10.1109/TITS.2020.3017632,Street View Text Recognition With Deep Learning for Urban Scene Understanding in Intelligent Transportation Systems,IEEE,Journals,"Understanding the surrounding scenes is one of the fundamental tasks in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), especially in unpredictable driving scenes or in developing regions/cities without digital maps. Street view is the most common scene during driving. Since streets are often full of shops with signboards, scene text recognition over the shop sign images in street views is of great significance and utility to urban scene understanding in ITS. To advance research in this field, (1) we build ShopSign, which is a large-scale scene text dataset of Chinese shop signs in street views. It contains 25,770 natural scene images, and 267,049 text instances. The images in ShopSign were captured in different scenes, from downtown to developing regions, and across 8 provinces and 20 cities in China, using more than 50 different mobile phones. It is very sparse and imbalanced in nature. (2) we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the performance of state-of-the-art DL based scene text reading algorithms on ShopSign and three other Chinese scene text datasets, which has not been addressed in the literature before. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that language has a critical influence on scene text detection. Moreover, by comparing the accuracy of four scene text recognition algorithms, we show that there is a very large room for further improvements in street view text recognition to fit real-world ITS applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9186709/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,July 2021,ieeexplore

These multi-modal data are usually transmitted and received by signal stations deployed in the city. However, reasonably choosing the signal stations' locations is still an open issue for enhancing people's life quality in the smart city. To this end, we propose the Super Resolution Deduction (SRD) model for solving the signal station selection problem. SRD first initializes the city map as a coarse-grained heat map representing the capacity of the signal stations. Then an image-based super-resolution deduction model is proposed to obtain a fine-grained signal station capacity for deploying. To be specific, we employ Dense Block to capture the spatio-temporal correlations, C-Attention to selectively enhance useful feature maps, and S-Distribution to impose structural constraints. By sharing the GPS data load with the new deployment of signal stations, we ensure the smart city's efficiency and effectiveness.

However, most previous studies were based on statistical data and did not reflect real street experience. Thanks to the Street View image and deep learning technology, researchers are able to carry out large scale studies from real human visual experience. In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software. Furthermore, the results from this study can be conveniently combined with other data because of the use of street-network-based data structure.

10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3047677,Urban Flood Mapping With Bitemporal Multispectral Imagery Via a Self-Supervised Learning Framework,IEEE,Journals,"Near realtime flood mapping in densely populated urban areas is critical for emergency response. The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics. Two flood events from areas with differing degrees of urbanization were considered: Hurricane Harvey flood (2017) in Houston, Texas, and Hurricane Florence flood (2018) in Lumberton, North Carolina. The proposed method shows strong performance for self-supervised urban flood mapping.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9309354/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2021,ieeexplore

VDIP provides a lightweight robust framework for detecting oncoming, preceding, sideview, and partially occluded vehicles in urban driving. In this paper, we use active learning to train independent-part detectors. A semisupervised approach is used for training part-matching classification, which forms sideview vehicles from independently detected parts.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2822547,Wireless Vehicular Check-in Protocol at Urban Road Intersection,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent organization of the traffic flow at an urban intersection is fundamentally important in intelligent transportation systems. Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator. Its usage brings about 10% improvement in both check-in ratio and packet reception ratio in comparison with the IEEE 802.11p.

Vehicular networks have the potential to become one of the important carriers of future mobile networks. The performance of current vehicular networks has been widely evaluated through simulation experiments due to the high cost and impracticality of other experimental approaches. The most paramount factors of vehicle networks are the authenticity of simulative evaluation, where the mobility of the vehicles is the first significant feature (i.e., the nodes of the vehicular network) that must be properly considered. However, generating the corresponding real mobility datasets has always been a big challenge although it is vital to the simulations of vehicular networks.

In this paper, we propose a solution: a low-cost and effective Smart Recycling Bin that utilizes the power of cloud to assist with waste classification. A centralized Information System (IS) collects measurements from smart bins that are deployed all around the city and classifies the waste of each bin using Artificial Intelligence and neural networks. Our implementation is capable of classifying different types of waste with an accuracy of 93.4% while keeping deployment cost and power consumption very low.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200283/,2020 9th International Conference on Modern Circuits and Systems Technologies (MOCAST),7-9 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

In such a system, the essential requirement is collecting and processing big data which will raise two critical issues, energy-conservation and scalability. To address the former issue, the GPS sleeping interval of a smart-phone is controlled by the back-end servers adaptively based on the real-time moving speed and transportation modes. To address the latter issue, we consider MapReduce to design the back-end Cloud, where intelligent learning and classification algorithms are implemented to detect the stops and transportation modes and provide smartphones with an appropriate GPS sleeping interval based on the GPS statistics on the back-end Cloud. The unique feature of our system is to integrate participatory sensing and Cloud-enabled processing system closely which incorporates knowledge extracted from the Cloud (i.e., transportation modes) into sensing control of smartphones. In this way, sensing control could be optimized through the knowledge behind crowdsourced data. Our system has been deployed in Singapore to support the Land Transport Authority's transportation activity survey over 1 year.

10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917004,A neuro-dynamic programming approach for perimeter control of two urban regions with macroscopic fundamental diagrams,IEEE,Conferences,"Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model is widely used to describe urban traffic dynamic system. Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced. Firstly, the value function is approximated by a neural network. Then the parameters are optimized by the policy iteration method, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative error toward set-point. Furthermore, the optimal control law constrained by a saturated operator is implemented based on real-time observations recursively. The neuro-dynamic controller is tested for the two-regional MFD system. The results confirm that the neuro-dynamic controller can regulate the traffic states converge to the desired uncongested equilibrium.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8917004/,2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),27-30 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques.

A load forecast is a basic stage in the process of the distribution system planning. Hence, a load forecast support system (LFSS) is a basic sub-system in the package of a decision support system for urban power systems planning. The knowledge and experience of planners play a vital part in the practical forecasting process.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4). Our investigation and observations indicate major improvements to predict unusual traffic accident event even after model compression and deployment.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals.

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore

This directly translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency.

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent's behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders' objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains).

In order to decrease the effect, we encode the crowd flow into graphs and propose a multi-graph neural network based model to solve the crowd flow forecasting problem. We first construct two K-NN graphs by the Euclidean distance and the Pearson correlation coefficient respectively and the spatial dependence is captured through the spatial block composed of Graph Attention Networks(GAT) and ChebNet, then another ChebNet is deployed to fuse the spatial dependency of the two graphs.

EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning. With the accurate long-term prediction of each EV charging station availability, drivers could schedule the charging activities wisely and avoid range anxiety. Data driven models are commonly applied to deal with the similar questions. However, due to the complex charging station distribution with topological road network structure and time-variant charging station availability, many widely used algorithms, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), could only extract the pure time-series information during the model training.

This causes the lot of stress to the drivers and delay in arrivals of emergency vehicles and other vehicles including priority vehicles. The above mentioned issues can be limited to an extend through the replacement of the existing inefficient (fixed) traffic control system with an efficient dynamic traffic light control system. The recent advancements in sensor technology enable us to capture the real-time traffic information which can be used to dynamically control the traffic light duration. Existing works either split the traffic signal into fixed duration or just extract very little real-time traffic data which might be inefficient in most of the traffic scenarios. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning model with vehicle heterogeneity (DLVH) for traffic control system. The DLVH model can dynamically change the traffic signal phase and duration based on the traffic information. We have evaluated DLVH via realistic simulation on Gwalior city map of India using an open-source simulator i.e., Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) which proves the effectiveness of the model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9065034/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Internet (ICII),11-12 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

According to the distribution of gray-level intensity of pedestrian samples, an adaptive local dual threshold segmentation algorithm is executed first to extract candidate regions. The presented pedestrian detector uses histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. In order to speed up the classification phase, the resulting support vectors (SVs) obtained by SVM is optimized to reduce the number of SVs used for decision. A further validation p hase is then introduced to filter the false alarms according to the distribution of gray-level intensity of pedestrians' heads. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs as fast as 34 frames per second on average and guarantees a real-time pedestrian detection; the whole system produces a detection rate of 84.83% at the cost of less than 4% false alarm rate on suburban scenes while produces a detection rate of about 81% at the cost of lower than 10% false alarm rate on urban scenes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6295596/,2012 IEEE International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques Proceedings,16-17 July 2012,ieeexplore

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

10.23919/ChiCC.2018.8483901,Findings on Queue Length Based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams with Enhanced Floating Car Estimation Method,IEEE,Conferences,"In recent research, the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) has been proved to be a powerful tool for large urban network modelling and control. This paper proposes a novel concept of queue length based MFD (QMFD) considering the fact that queue length is usually regarded as an important index to evaluate the efficiency of intersections. Compared to traditional MFD, the QMFD can reflect the traffic status more intuitively and can be understood more easily by transportation managers and residents. However, the queue length of some links may not be obtained directly in real situations if no fixed detector is available. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a floating car data (FCD) based method to estimate the QMFD. Firstly, a new queue length estimation method is developed by using BP neural network with different floating car percentage. Secondly, based on the estimated queue length, QMFD is calculated by fitting the relationship between the average queue length and other macroscopic traffic parameters such as average flow at intersections. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the traffic data provided by traffic simulation software VISSIM with the real road networks of Beijing's Second Ring Road. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed queue length estimation method, and also reveal the existence of QMFD.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8483901/,2018 37th Chinese Control Conference (CCC),25-27 July 2018,ieeexplore

Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy.

We introduce a systematic factor analysis approach for urban information by using Bayesian Network (BN) framework. We build a BN structure to present the causal relationships among city information factors based on integrated data sets. In addition, our approach is a dynamic modeling method because the learned BN structure will change in different time periods depends on the different service that the city provides. With structural leaning and real time monitoring, we perform Bayesian inference on the BN structure and the transformation of BN structure. We provide high level views to planners in the sense that identifying the potential cause or outcome of a city operational factor and examining the implementation of certain policies. Opinions from city planning experts may help us improve our model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5596379/,The 2010 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),18-23 July 2010,ieeexplore
10.1109/GIOTS.2017.8016227,Identifying parking spaces &amp; detecting occupancy using vision-based IoT devices,IEEE,Conferences,"The increasing number of vehicles in high density, urban areas is leading to significant parking space shortages. While systems have been developed to enable visibility into parking space vacancies for drivers, most rely on costly, dedicated sensor devices that require high installation costs. The proliferation of inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables the use of compute platforms with integrated cameras that could be used to monitor parking space occupancy. However, even with camera-captured images, manual specification of parking space locations is required before such devices can be used by drivers after device installation. In this paper, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop a method to dynamically identify parking space topologies based on parked vehicle positions. More specifically, we designed and evaluated an occupation detection model to identify vacant parking spaces. We built a prototype implementation of the whole system using a Raspberry Pi and evaluated it on a real-world urban street near the University of Washington campus. The results show that our clustering-based learning technique coupled with our occupation detection pipeline is able to correctly identify parking spaces and determine occupancy without manual specication of parking space locations with an accuracy of 91%. By dynamically aggregating identied parking spaces from multiple IoT devices using Amazon Cloud Services, we demonstrated how a complete, city-wide parking management system can be quickly deployed at low cost.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8016227/,2017 Global Internet of Things Summit (GIoTS),6-9 June 2017,ieeexplore

Both of them involve transmitters and receivers less than 10 m high inducing a more complex urban environment. This paper presents a framework of integrating composite urban furniture, e.g., traffic signs, traffic lights, etc., into ray-tracing tools. The framework starts with the theoretical modeling for radar cross section of furniture components and validation of full-wave analysis simulation in the far field. Then, in order to locally fulfill the far field condition in the small cells or D2D scenarios, the furniture is divided into small segments so that the models in the far field are still applicable. Finally, the decomposed furniture is implemented in a ray-tracing tool and validated by measurements in real scenarios. Under this framework, researchers can improve the ray-tracing tools with more essential elements of urban environment. Last but not least, this paper provides a case study to demonstrate the implementation of the framework, and the results show that the traffic signs indeed influence the vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which is one of the most frequently occurring applications of outdoor D2D systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7481737/,2016 10th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP),10-15 April 2016,ieeexplore

However, the generation and maintenance of such maps is costly and hinders large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. This paper presents the first self-supervised learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1) a learning-based decision-making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise.

Current research still cannot guarantee a perfect perception, and failure detections may cause collisions, leading to untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. This work proposes a trajectory planner to tolerate the detection failure of the LiDAR sensors. This method will plan the path relying on the detected objects as well as the raw sensor data. The overlapping and contradiction of both perception routes will be carefully addressed for safe and efficient driving. The object detector in this work uses a deep learning-based method, i.e., CNN-Segmentation neural network. The designed trajectory planner has multi-layers to handle the multi-resolution environment formed by different perception routes. The final system will dynamically adjust its attention to the detected objects or the point cloud to avoid collision due to detection failures. This method is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle to drive in an open urban area. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle fails to detect a surrounding object, e.g., vehicles or some undefined objects, the autonomous vehicles still can plan an efficient and safe trajectory. In the meantime, when the perception system works well, the A V will not be affected by the point clouds.

The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener. The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it already learned.

Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model traffic data as spatiotemporal graph, have attracted lots of attention. However, existing GCNs mainly focus on pre-defined graph structure which is fixed over the entire network. These methods of traffic forecasting can not capture the complex spatial correlations especially for the higher level features. To address these problems, we propose a novel Multi-Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (MAGCN) for traffic forecasting in this work. Our model can dynamically learn the topology of the graph through multi-range GCNs in an end-to-end manner. This data-driven method makes the construction of graph more flexible and increases the generality of model to adapt to various data samples. Moreover, in the proposed framework, we design a novel Differential Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (DTGCN) to capture the periodic and immediate temporal correlations of traffic data, which is integrated in MAGCN to effectively capture the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies. Besides, we adopt a multi-subgraph encoding mechanism to enhance the representation of complex spatial dependency.

These aspects are of particular relevance in problems like localization, in which the representation of spatial features is unavoidable. In particular, examples of localization problems that are considered in the paper are: shopping center localization in extra-urban areas, guide placement in museums, and sign and poster positioning in cities. Moreover, the paper briefly presents the software system that has been developed for the three-dimensional (3D) simulation of virtual worlds inhabited by virtual agents. This tool has been exploited for 3D representation of the presented MMASS-based models of localization problems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1241099/,"IEEE/WIC International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology, 2003.

10.1109/TELSIKS52058.2021.9606379,Machine Learning for Air Quality Classification in IoT-based Network with Low-cost Sensors,IEEE,Conferences,"Air pollution is a rising problem, with its effects being especially severe in urban and industrial areas. A constant and local monitoring of air quality, and the suitable presentation of the results to population, demands deployment of large-scale IoT-based monitoring networks in which low-cost, low-quality sensors would be predominantly used. However, the inherent measurement errors could incur large AQI (Air Quality Index) calculation error. Also, appropriate presentation of air pollution demands that measurements of air pollutants’ concentrations are classified into Air Quality Classes, thus making the classification task for AQI of large interest. In this paper we analyzed a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in order to solve classification task for AQI, but under the assumption of low-cost sensor deployment in the real-world application. The results of comprehensive analysis suggest that DL models designed, optimized and tested in this paper present a viable and the most suitable solution under these demands.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9606379/,"2021 15th International Conference on Advanced Technologies, Systems and Services in Telecommunications (TELSIKS)",20-22 Oct. 2021,ieeexplore
10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

The aim of this study is to develop a fuzzy system that can classify congestion using a real-world dataset referred to as Manchester Urban Congestion Dataset, which contains data similar to that collected by connected and autonomous vehicles. A set of fuzzy membership functions and rules were developed using a road congestion ontology and in conjunction with domain experts.

The potential of this technology is clear and transportation is expected to change dramatically over what is known today. The advantages of Autonomous Vehicles are pollution reduction in urban areas due to improved driving and fuel efficiency to help control traffic flow and parking problems. In addition, Autonomous Vehicles accelerate people and cargo transportation, as well as reducing human errors. There are a variety of issues in the field of Autonomous Vehicles which one of them is the issue of detecting and tracking motion objects as obstacles. In this article, we presented a novel method to optimizing motion objects detection and tracking from the KITTI data set in Autonomous Vehicles in a specific range in between 50 to 80 meters. This approach proposes a real-time and simultaneous structure for motion detection and tracking, so that the data fully enter the combined method called CRF-based Deep Spiking Neural Network with Probabilistic Particle Filter (PPF-DSNN).

10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488713,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Urban Crowd Sensing with For-Hire Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently, vehicular crowd sensing (VCS) that leverages sensor-equipped urban vehicles to collect city-scale sensory data has emerged as a promising paradigm for urban sensing. Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (GCC-MARL) framework, which helps FHVs make distributed routing decisions that cooperatively optimize the system-wide global objective. Specifically, GCC-MARL meticulously assigns credits to agents in the training process to effectively stimulate cooperation, represents agents' actions by a carefully chosen statistics to cope with the variable agent scales, and integrates graph convolution to capture useful spatial features from complex large-scale urban road networks. We conduct extensive experiments with a real-world dataset collected in Shenzhen, China, containing around 1 million trajectories and 50 thousand orders of 553 taxis per-day from June 1st to 30th, 2017.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of PBEM on two real-life trajectory-based check-in datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9006662/,2019 Twelfth International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Network (ICMU),4-6 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/WASPAA.2019.8937193,Polyphonic Sound Event and Sound Activity Detection: A Multi-Task Approach,IEEE,Conferences,"Polyphonic Sound Event Detection (SED) in real-world recordings is a challenging task because of the dynamic polyphony level, intensity, and duration of sound events. Current polyphonic SED systems fail to model the temporal structure of sound events explicitly and instead attempt to look at which sound events are present at each audio frame. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is much lower than the segment-wise detection performance. In this work, we propose a joint model approach to improve the temporal localization of sound events using a multi-task learning setup. The first task predicts which sound events are present at each time frame; we call this branch `Sound Event Detection (SED) model', while the second task predicts if a sound event is present or not at each frame; we call this branch `Sound Activity Detection (SAD) model'. We verify the proposed joint model by comparing it with a separate implementation of both tasks aggregated together from individual task predictions. Our experiments on the URBAN-SED dataset show that the proposed joint model can alleviate False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) errors and improve both the segment-wise and the event-wise metrics.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8937193/,2019 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA),20-23 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore

However, it is highly costly and time-consuming to obtain many travel time data. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm structure to calculate the travel time which utilize neural network to dynamically predict future speed and employ data fusion to integrate the speed data of different detectors in a urban expressway link. Based on the algorithm structure, two practical travel time prediction algorithms, called as Space Discretization Travel Time Calculation Algorithm (SDTCM) and Speed Integral Travel Time Calculation Method (SITCM), were developed by the discretization of the space and integral of the predicted speed. Vehicle plate recognition technology was used to collect the real travel time data in the test section on Beijing Third-Ring urban expressway to evaluate the algorithms. The obtained results show that the average prediction error of two algorithms are both less than 10% which can meet the requirement of the field applications and the algorithms are easy to be implemented as no travel time data collection are needed in advance. The two algorithms have some advantages and disadvantages over each other in accuracy and smoothness.

In this paper, we seek to answer two questions: Are current LTE networks ready to support Day-1 applications at all times? And, can underperforming situations be reliably predicted based on GPS and network-related information? To address these questions, we first implement a system that collects positioning data and LTE key performance indicators (KPIs) with a higher time resolution than commercial off-the-shelf LTE modems, while simultaneously measuring the end-to-end (E2E) delay of an LTE network. We then use this system to assess the readiness of multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) and a live Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) deployment in an urban scenario.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

Managing these signal control systems at their optimal performance has been an important research focus in traffic engineering. However, various optimization techniques and algorithms developed for adaptive signal control are less effective for real-time implementation in non-lane following heterogeneous road traffic due to the following possible reasons: erroneous demand estimation, time-expensive computations, or uncertainty of getting optimal solutions. Rather, these models work efficiently for homogeneous lane-following traffic where demand predictions are accurate. This work proposes an optimization model that minimizes the total average control delay and finds the optimal green times without any explicit demand prediction for heterogeneous non-lane following road traffic. The proposed solution approach finds the optimal green times and the cycle time in real-time, and the obtained solutions are adaptive to traffic fluctuations.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster.

Wastewater management systems are conceived explicitly for purifying wastewater, providing clean water efficiently, but this is a hard task due to frequent and quite unpredictable fluctuations of inlet wastewater flows, arising from (random) rain water or (periodical, e.g. day-night) sewage sources, sometimes also leading to failures and outages. To ensure the quality of the clean water out above a threshold and keep the overall system operating, this paper proposes the smart wastewater intelligent management system (SWIMS). It monitors and controls inlet and outlet flows as well as the water quality and parts of the plant as a cyber-physical system (CPS), starting from an Environmental Internet of Things (EIoT) platform. The data generated from the treatment plant is collected in an information system hosted by a server together with an intelligent system that processes this information in a real-time fashion and provides the feedback for optimizing the plant to maintain a good quality of water over time.

This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

Specifically, we propose stacked Gaussian process learning, a meta-learning scheme in which a base Gaussian process is enhanced by adding the posterior covariance functions of other related tasks to its covariance function in a stage-wise optimization. The idea is that the stacked posterior covariances encode the hidden common causes among variables of interest that are shared across the related regression tasks. Stacked Gaussian process learning is efficient, capable of capturing shared common causes, and can be implemented with any kind of standard Gaussian process regression model such as sparse approximations and relational variants. Our experimental results on real-world data from the market relevant application show that stacked Gaussian processes learning can significantly improve prediction performance of a standard Gaussian process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5360264/,2009 Ninth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining,6-9 Dec. 2009,ieeexplore

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

The current cloud and high-performance computing infrastructures, as well as modern edge computing systems especially in the 5G and beyond networks, can be addressed to resolve these challenges. However, there are several application areas especially in vehicular and urban computing, where just harnessing more computational power does not solve computational and real-time requirements of the modern sensing systems that operate in mobile and context-dependent environments. For now, the mathematical challenges of distributed computing and real-time learning algorithms have not been profoundly addressed in the context of the IoT and real-world sensing applications. Data-driven systems also require giving full attention to information delivery, data management, data cleaning, and sensor fusion technologies that need to be equally distributed and real-time competent as the learning algorithms themselves. New software-defined computing and networking approaches and architectures are required to orchestrate the numerous connected resources dynamically, controllably, and securely along with the evolving needs.

In such approaches, traffic light control parameters are not pre-defined, but intelligent agents controlling the junctions learn the suitable traffic signal settings. In order to consider applications of RL in commercial UTC products, they need to enable fine-grained optimization of multiple traffic objectives and be validated in realistic UTC simulations. This paper presents REALT, a UTC system based on Distributed W-Learning (DWL), a multi-policy multi-agent RL-based optimization technique, which enables it to address multiple traffic optimization goals simultaneously. We introduce an extension of DWL with fine-grained traffic observation to enable adaptation of phase duration rather than just phase selection. We also evaluate the impact of action set selection in RL applications to UTC, by introducing a phase generation module which enables REALT to use different phase sets.

Results of the evaluation of the model show that this model is able to measure system efficiency according to variances in the crossroads adjustments. Also, this model is cheaper and less time-consuming. On this basis, this modeling can be used for the evaluating and even predicting the efficacy of the traffic control system in the crossroads.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence suggest vehicle navigation by autonomous agents will be possible in the near future. In a previous paper, we proposed a reservation-based system for alleviating traffic congestion, specifically at intersections. This paper extends our prototype implementation in several ways with the aim of making it more implementable in the real world. In particular, we 1) add the ability of vehicles to turn, 2) enable them to accelerate while in the intersection, 3) give a better sensor model and communication-efficient heuristic to our driver agent, and 4) augment their interaction capabilities with a detailed protocol such that the vehicles do not need to know anything about the intersection control policy. The use of this protocol limits the interaction of the driver agent and the intersection manager to the extent that it is a reasonable approximation of reliable wireless communication.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

10.1109/IV48863.2021.9575140,Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS): A fully probabilistic 3D tracking approach based on 2D detections,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban Traffic Surveillance (UTS) is a surveillance system based on a monocular and calibrated video camera that detects vehicles in an urban traffic scenario with dense traffic on multiple lanes and vehicles performing sharp turning maneuvers. UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, we give a qualitative impression of how UTS performs on real-world data. Our implementation is capable of operating in real time on a reasonably modern workstation. To the best of our knowledge, UTS is to date the only 3D vehicle tracking system in a surveillance scenario (static camera observing moving targets).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9575140/,2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),11-17 July 2021,ieeexplore

Offsets are calculated by the real-time average speeds. The control layer determines phase composition and adjusts splits at the end of each cycle. The target of this control strategy is to maximize the possibility for vehicles in each direction along the arterial road to pass the local intersection without stop while the utility efficiency of the green signal time is at relatively high level.

In this paper, we investigate and evaluate the performance of thirteen machine learning (ML) algorithms (including multi-target algorithms) employed in conjunction with fingerprint based MT localization for distributed massive multiple input multiple-output (DM-MIMO) wireless systems configurations. The fingerprints will rely solely on the received signal strengths (RSS) from the single-antenna MT collected at each of the receive antenna elements of the massive MIMO base station. The performance is evaluated through numerical simulations incorporating practical millimeter-wave signal propagation models suited for 5G wireless systems in combination with ray-tracing techniques, and in conjunction with the 3D OpenStreetMap to replicate real-life environments. In addition, the ML computational platform, and implementation of the proposed framework was selected with a focus on efficiently handling the anticipated big data that could be generated from a typical 5G network with expected large subscriber cell density (1 million/km<sup>2</sup>).

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure.

The basic characteristics of travel flows are first revealed based on the NMF algorithm. Then, the nonlinear time series coefficient matrix, extracted from the NMF algorithm, is estimated based on the AR model.

Consequently, one of the most challenging issues of a bike-sharing system is predicting the required number of shared bikes at each station. In this article, we take the real aspects of a bike-sharing system into account, e.g., the high complexity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty of the traffic flow, and propose a hybrid edge-computing-based machine learning model. Notably, our proposed model, which combines a self-organizing mapping network with a regression tree (RT), is applied to predict the bicycle demand of a certain station through the following steps: 1) the proposed model adopts self-organization mapping to assemble the original samples in the form of clusters and 2) each cluster is then built as an RT to forecast the required number of bikes at each station.

However, most of current algorithms usually require unrealistic global communication, which makes them impractical for real distributed systems.

We believe that our approach is able to fill the gap between the two kinds of traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches by providing both agent-level implementation and system-level convergence verification. The basic idea of this approach is that agents learn not only from local environmental feedback, i.e., their own experiences and rewards, but also from other agents' experiences.

Tracking an object of interest across the camera network in near real-time is a canonical problem. However, current tracking platforms have two key limitations: 1) They are monolithic, proprietary and lack the ability to rapidly incorporate sophisticated tracking models, and 2) They are less responsive to dynamism across wide-area computing resources that include edge, fog, and cloud abstractions. We address these gaps using Anveshak, a runtime platform for composing and coordinating distributed tracking applications. It provides a domain-specific dataflow programming model to intuitively compose a tracking application, supporting contemporary CV advances like query fusion and re-identification, and enabling dynamic scoping of the camera network's search space to avoid wasted computation. We also offer tunable batching and data-dropping strategies for dataflow blocks deployed on distributed resources to respond to network and compute variability. These balance the tracking accuracy, its real-time performance, and the active camera-set size. We illustrate the concise expressiveness of the programming model for four tracking applications.

With advances network infrastructure, smart sensors, and various monitoring technologies, a standardized energy metering infrastructure, called advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), has been introduced and deployed to urban households to allow them to develop efficient power generation plans. Compared to traditional stochastic approaches for time-series data analysis, deep-learning methods have shown superior accuracy on many prediction applications. Because smart meters and infrastructure monitors produce a series of measurements over time, a large amount of data is accumulated, creating a large data stream, which takes much time from data generation to deployment of deep-learning model training.

The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing.

The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements.

Due to the constrained resource devices and hazardous deployment, urban sensing is vulnerable to interference and destruction of external factors or the impact of external environmental emergencies. Abnormal data, outliers, or anomalies have affected the utility in various domains seriously. Timely and accurate detection of unexpected events, monitoring of network performance, and anomaly detection of data flow are of great significance to improve the decision-making ability of the system. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method for urban sensing based on sequential data and credibility. First, based on Bayesian methods, a reputation model is established for the selection of credible sample points. Second, aiming at the problem that the threshold range is difficult to determine in the traditional method, the pivot quantity is defined by using the median of the credible sample, and the confidence interval can be estimated to quantify the deviation degree of the sensor data. Finally, an anomaly data identification and source verification approach is proposed to distinguish errors and events accurately.

A Causal Evaluative Review and Methodical Redirection for Intelligence Systems,IEEE,Journals,"The chronic growth of networked complexities in today's world, now require highly efficient evolvable systems. However, diverse open issues and inabilities are facing urban planning practice and social sciences due to the limitations of artificial intelligence planning tools. These incapacities have relatively limited our ability to perceive and handle possible present and future temperamental situations in socio-physical contexts and in real-time modes. Here, we theoretically present two simple philosophical and systematic causal models to help software engineers to understand this philosophical and complexity dilemma from an urban planning perspective. The first model evaluates the reliance on perceptual and bounding trajectories. It discusses discrete and finite-expert systems that perceive specific parts of self-organization's complexities, while bounding limited facets only of general intelligence to address certain issues in urban planning and social contexts. This implies the second causal model that is based on aligning to urban self-organizational happenings, by putting philosophical foundations for a responsive artificial superintelligence (ASI). This proposed ASI is based on connecting between complex adaptive systems in our contexts by open-endedly hosting and operating infinite expert systems to reflect different fields and functions, toward asymptotic infinite intellectual capacity.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7972958/,IEEE Access,2017,ieeexplore

However, the state-of-the-art object detection techniques designed for images captured using ground-level sensors usually experience a sharp performance drop when directly applied to remote sensing images, largely due to the object appearance differences in remote sensing images in terms of sparse texture, low contrast, arbitrary orientations, and large-scale variations. This paper presents a novel object detection network [(context-aware detection network (CAD-Net)] that exploits attention-modulated features as well as global and local contexts to address the new challenges in detecting objects from remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net learns global and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the global scene (at scene level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at object level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware attention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions and features as well as more appropriate feature scales. Experiments over two publicly available object detection data sets for remote sensing images demonstrate that the proposed CAD-Net achieves superior detection performance.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas.

Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic passenger flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban traffic passenger flows in different transportation lines, a more efficient and fine-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model the passenger flows among different traffic lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical traffic data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction.

To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) (learning systems) and expert systems (knowledge-based systems) have been extensively explored as approaches for decision-making. While the ANNs compute decisions by learning from successfully solved examples, the expert systems rely on a knowledge base developed by human reasoning for decision making. It is possible to integrate the learning abilities of an ANN and the knowledge-based decision-making ability of the expert system. This paper presents a real-time intelligent decision-making system, IDUTC, for urban traffic control applications. The system integrates a backpropagation-based ANN that can learn and adapt to the dynamically changing environment and a fuzzy expert system for decision-making. The performance of the proposed intelligent decision-making system is evaluated by mapping the adaptable traffic light control problem. The application is implemented using the ANN approach, the FES approach, and the proposed integrated system approach.

These multiple types of sensing data hold some inherent correlations, which can be leveraged to further reduce the sensing cost and improve the accuracy of the inferred results. In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional urban sensing in sparse MCS to jointly address the data inference and cell selection for multi-task scenarios. We exploit the intra- and inter-task correlations in data inference to deduce the data of the unsensed cells through the multi-task compressive sensing and then learn and select the most effective 〈cell, task〉 pairs by using reinforcement learning. To effectively capture the intra- and inter-task correlations in cell selection, we design a network structure with multiple branches, where branches extract the intra-task correlations for each task, respectively, and then catenates the results from all branches to capture the inter-task correlations among the multiple tasks.

The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism.

First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene.

10.1109/TITS.2019.2935152,T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction,IEEE,Journals,"Accurate and real-time traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent traffic system and is of great significance for urban traffic planning, traffic management, and traffic control. However, traffic forecasting has always been considered an “open” scientific issue, owing to the constraints of urban road network topological structure and the law of dynamic change with time. To capture the spatial and temporal dependences simultaneously, we propose a novel neural network-based traffic forecasting method, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN) model, which is combined with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). Specifically, the GCN is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the gated recurrent unit is used to learn dynamic changes of traffic data for capturing temporal dependence. Then, the T-GCN model is employed to traffic forecasting based on the urban road network. Experiments demonstrate that our T-GCN model can obtain the spatio-temporal correlation from traffic data and the predictions outperform state-of-art baselines on real-world traffic datasets. Our tensorflow implementation of the T-GCN is available at https://www.github.com/lehaifeng/T-GCN.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809901/,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

To date, there are only a handful of research studies about understanding the usage of urban public spaces. Leveraging IoT, various sensors have been deployed in an urban residential area to monitor and study public space utilization patterns. In this article, we propose a data processing system to generate space-centric insights about the utilization of an urban residential region of multiple Points of Interests (PoIs) that consists of 190 000 m<sup>2</sup> real estate. We identify the activeness of each PoI based on the spectral clustering, and then study their corresponding static features, which are composed of transportation, commercial facilities, population density, along with other characteristics.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951294,Urban Commerce Distribution Analysis Based on Street View and Deep Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Urban commerce and its distribution have always been an important part of urban research. However, most previous studies were based on statistical data and did not reflect real street experience. Thanks to the Street View image and deep learning technology, researchers are able to carry out large scale studies from real human visual experience. In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software. Furthermore, the results from this study can be conveniently combined with other data because of the use of street-network-based data structure.

10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3047677,Urban Flood Mapping With Bitemporal Multispectral Imagery Via a Self-Supervised Learning Framework,IEEE,Journals,"Near realtime flood mapping in densely populated urban areas is critical for emergency response. The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics. Two flood events from areas with differing degrees of urbanization were considered: Hurricane Harvey flood (2017) in Houston, Texas, and Hurricane Florence flood (2018) in Lumberton, North Carolina. The proposed method shows strong performance for self-supervised urban flood mapping.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9309354/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845339,Using Social Media for Attendees Density Estimation in City-Scale Events,IEEE,Journals,"City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374412/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2822547,Wireless Vehicular Check-in Protocol at Urban Road Intersection,IEEE,Journals,"Intelligent organization of the traffic flow at an urban intersection is fundamentally important in intelligent transportation systems. Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator. Its usage brings about 10% improvement in both check-in ratio and packet reception ratio in comparison with the IEEE 802.11p.

The large spectral variability of man-made structures, as well as the mixed pixel phenomenon, imposes the use of computational demanding techniques, which are not always effective for real case applications. Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, which are mainly used for classification and regression analysis. Specifically, a support vector classifier (SVC) constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which separates the training data into different classes. These are then used to classify a whole image, or series of images. The current standard SVM algorithm for classification used by the most popular mapping software (e.g., ENVI, EnMAP) is the C-SVC. The parameterization of a C-SVC strongly affects the final classification result. Yet, there is no rule of thumb to choose the optimal parameters when classifying satellite imagery. Optimal parameterization totally depends on the training data, and to determine it for a specific case, a time-consuming trial-and-error process is inevitable. In this work, advancements for the C-SVC algorithm are proposed to enhance its performance when used to classify remote sensing data, eliminating the need for a part of manual parametrization, while ensuring increasing its performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9180087/,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,May 2021,ieeexplore

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE).

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions.

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules.

Feature tracking being a core part of SfM and MVS, is essential for multiview scene modeling and perception, but difficult to evaluate in large scale datasets due to the lack of sufficient ground-truth. For large-scale aerial imagery, accurate camera orientation and dense 3D point cloud accuracy can be used to assess the impact of accurate feature localization and track length.

Smart homes can improve the patient's quality of life and safety through the innovative use of advanced technologies. Telemedicine and telecare are driving forces behind the adoption of smart homes. The telecare medicine information system (TMIS) has drawn worldwide attention for the past 20 years, as modern technologies have made remote delivery of healthcare a reality. TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services. TMIS delivers capabilities to remotely provide $24\times 7$ health care facilities to patients. Its purpose is to provide patients with convenient and expedited remote health care services, greatly improving the quality and efficiency of health care services. However, the open and insecure nature of the internet poses a number of security threats to patient secrecy and privacy. Security design for TMIS is not trivial. Essential security and privacy are provided by mutual authentication and key agreement protocols. This paper proposes an efficient and secure, bilinear pairing-based, unlink-able, mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for TMIS.

In this article, we present the methodologies to minimize the efforts of implementing new smart city solutions and maximizing the sharing of components. The final target is to have a live technical community of smart city application developers. The results of this activity come from the implementation of 35 city services in 27 cities between Europe and South Korea. To share efforts, we encourage developers to devise applications using a modular approach. Single-function components that are reusable by other city services are packaged and published as standalone components, named atomic services. We identify 15 atomic services addressing smart city challenges in data analytics, data evaluation, data integration, data validation, and visualization. Thirty-eight instances of the atomic services are already operational in several smart city services. We detail in this article, as atomic service examples, some data predictor components.

10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845339,Using Social Media for Attendees Density Estimation in City-Scale Events,IEEE,Journals,"City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8374412/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

To reduce the cost and time in building up different simulation environments, it is therefore highly desirable to have a repository of object models that are interoperable and extensible thus can be reused in different applications. To this end, we propose a generic model framework which supports model interoperability and reusability for MOUT simulations.

It is common to observe emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire engines obstructed by traffic snarls on Indian roads, especially in the proximity of busy intersections. Existing literature primarily advocates the deployment of RFID technology to terminate the round-robin sequence of the signal system and switch the signal to green in the required direction. However, this technology has proven to be susceptible to electromagnetic interferences and also the economic feasibility is questionable. This paper proposes a model that employs real time image processing and object detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SSD Mobilenet. Unlike a few other architectures, SSD Mobilenet requires very limited computation, hence enabling swift detection. Furthermore, an acoustic signal (sound) processing (pitch detection) algorithm is employed to detect the sirens of emergency vehicles to nullify the potential false positives (e.g. an ambulance in a non-emergency scenario) that creep into object detection using image processing. Both algorithms work in unison, bolstering the accuracy of detection. Upon detection, the signal instantly switches to green, facilitating the expedited movement of emergency vehicles, even in high traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9074933/,2020 2nd International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA),5-7 March 2020,ieeexplore

In the first phase of the model, meteorological variables optimal to the response (here rainfall) are selected with the optimal lag value of the response variable. A dynamic variable selection method named, time series least angle regression (TS-LARS) is applied in this phase. In the second phase, an ensemble comprising artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed. The number of hidden neurons in each ANN are selected randomly to speed up the training of the ensemble. The optimization of each ANN is done by Levenberg Marquart Gradient Descent method. In the third phase of the ensemble, the component ANN models are ranked based on mutual information (MI) between the outputs of the base models and the original output. Before applying MI, we have used independent component analysis (ICA) to extract the base models which are independent with each other. Finally the highest ranked base models are combined to construct the ensemble model. A real world case study has been setup in Fukuoka city, Japan. Daily rainfall data from 1990 to 2010 with relevant meteorological variables are extracted to construct the data.

Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects.

As the volume of data from the social world is exploding, social media data analysis has become an emerging area in many different disciplines. During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event. To address this limitation, we proposed a BERT-based Adversarial Domain Adaptation model (BERT-ADA) for crisis tweet classification.

10.1109/CyberC.2010.83,An Ambient Service Model for Providing Structured Web Information Based on User-Contexts,IEEE,Conferences,"Users often visit many stores while they compare merchandise in order to purchase the merchandise or merchandise related to it. Given a service providing information such as location of these stores, they can reduce their time and effort spent by wandering around them because they can go straight to these stores. And they can obtain new purchase opportunities because they can know what kinds of related stores are around them. Thus, they can do efficient purchasing activities. In this paper, we discuss service providing information of related stores efficiently in order to support users' efficient purchasing activities. And we propose an ambient service model that consists of three layers: structured (purchase-related) information space, real-life space, and ambient information space. In this model, a lot of store information collected from the web is grouped and structured automatically by relation in terms of purchasing. And users search information of related stores by using an ambient query that is automatically created by their context in real-life space. Finally, they obtain information of related stores in the form of hierarchy structure through map interface. Then, they can search other kinds of information of related stores additionally by using the hierarchy structure. We implemented a system based on this model by using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), map-based, location-based and ontology technology. The implemented system was performed in specific shopping region (Ilsan Lapesta shopping mall, Goyang-city Gyeonggi-do, Korea). And we confirmed that users can efficiently obtain information of related stores through the system.

10.1109/SNPD.2008.90,An Approach to Modeling Software Safety,IEEE,Conferences,"Software for safety-critical systems must deal with the hazards identified by safety analysis in order to make the system safe, risk-free and fail-safe. Software safety is a composite of many factors. Existing software quality models like McCall's and Boehm's and ISO 9126 are inadequate in addressing the software safety issues of real time safety-critical embedded systems. At present there does not exist any standard framework that comprehensively addresses the factors, criteria and metrics (FCM) approach of the quality models in respect of software safety. This paper proposes a new framework for software safety based on the McCall's software quality model that specifically identifies the criteria corresponding to software safety in safety critical applications. The criteria in the proposed software safety model pertains to system hazard analysis, completeness of requirements, identification of software-related safety- critical requirements, safety-constraints based design, runtime issues management, and software safety-critical testing.

10.1109/HASE.2012.33,An Autonomic Reliability Improvement System for Cyber-Physical Systems,IEEE,Conferences,"System reliability is a fundamental requirement of cyber-physical systems. Unreliable systems can lead to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability. We have implemented ARIS in a large commercial building cyber-physical system in New York City, and our experiment has shown that it is effective and efficient in improving building system reliability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6375637/,2012 IEEE 14th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering,25-27 Oct. 2012,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICCC.2018.00010,An Edge Based Smart Parking Solution Using Camera Networks and Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"The smart parking industry continues to evolve as an increasing number of cities struggle with traffic congestion and inadequate parking availability. For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

Although the proposed models have been remarkably improved in recent years, there are still questions that need to be answered before deploying models. For example, it is difficult to figure out which models provide state-of-the-art performance, as recently proposed models have often been evaluated with different datasets and experiment environments. It is also difficult to determine which models would work when traffic conditions change abruptly (e.g., rush hour). In this work, we conduct two experiments to answer the two questions. In the first experiment, we conduct an experiment with the state-of-the-art models and the identical public datasets to compare model performance under a consistent experiment environment. We then extract a set of temporal regions in the datasets, whose speeds change abruptly and use these regions to explore model performance with difficult intervals. The experiment results indicate that Graph-WaveNet and GMAN show better performance in general.

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city. In addition the networks have been implemented on an embedded GPU platform to investigate the real-time capability of the presented approach. The networks were configured and trained to predict five seconds into the future with a sample time of 0.2 s. The results of each network are presented and compared against each other. The results show that the implemented networks are capable of predicting a trajectory in short to mid-term (1 - 3 s) with good accuracy while having difficulties predicting turn maneuvers in long-term range (3 - 5 s) due to the lack of road layout information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9564999/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/RCAR.2018.8621725,An Image Recognition Approach for Coal and Gangue Used in Pick-Up Robot,IEEE,Conferences,"Picking gangue from raw coal is a crucial step of coal production. Due to the potential for replacing manual workers, the study of pick-up robot is attracting much interest. Pick-up robots usually work in fixed working areas where the types of coals and gangues are unitary. Based on this fact, this paper proposes a simple, fast, and easily implemented approach for coal and gangue classification which is LS-SVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) based using gray scale and texture as features. We firstly sampled the image dataset from Han City, Shaanxi province and Jizhong, Hebei province which are two main mining areas in China. The data of Han City consists of the images of lean coal and shale, and the data of Jizhong is coking coal and sandstone. By analyzing the gray scale and the texture of the sampled data, we discover that coal and gangue vary in the parameters including the mean and peak of gray scale, contrast ratio, and entropy. Therefore, these four parameters are chosen as features. We utilize LS-SVM as the machine learning model, and the model is trained with three groups of parameters separately. The first are the mean and peak of gray scale, the second are the contrast ratio and entropy which represents texture features, and the third are the peak of gray scale and the contrast ratio which integrates gray scale and texture features. After evaluation by using our sampled dataset, the model trained by the third group outperforms others. The classification results were 98.7% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Han city, and 98.6% correct of coal and 96.6% correct of gangue for the data of Jizhong.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8621725/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR),1-5 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore

Businesses have already started to use Big Data Analytics, particularly predictive and prescriptive analytics, to strengthen and increase their business yields. Not only has analytics resulted in business growth, but has also provided a significant competitive edge over others. The voluminous data generated from various resources is highly unstructured in nature and adding a structure to it would leverage the actual potential of the data. New techniques and frameworks should serve as human aids in automatically and intelligently analyzing large datasets in order to acquire useful information. In this paper, we attempt to perform Big Data Analytics on data from one of the most important and growing sources, namely, Telecommunication. To keep pace with the growing telecommunication market and ever increasing demands of the consumers for quality service, the telecom service providers are required to observe and estimate various trends in customer's usage to plan future upgrades and deployments driven by real data. We have attempted to use several data mining techniques to find hidden and interesting patterns from the telecom data generated by Telecoms Italia cellular network for the city of Milano, Italy. K-means clustering is used to categorize the usage statistics while several machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM are used for predicting the usage of telecom services. In the end, a performance comparison matrix is generated to rate the performance of these algorithms for the given dataset.

10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223311,Blockchain framework for real-time streaming data generated in image sensor networks for smart monitoring,IEEE,Conferences,"The smart city concept is attracting increasing attention from society. Smart monitoring, which enables the detection and prevention of road traffic accidents, is one promising application of the smart city concept. The deployment of three-dimensional (3D) image sensor networks formed by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices interconnected via a network is a key enabler for smart monitoring. Data collected by image sensor networks for smart monitoring are sensitive because the usage of the data is often related to public safety or law enforcement. Managing sensor data using the blockchain technology is one way to address these sensitivity concerns, as a blockchain network helps prevent data from being tampered with even by the administrators of the system. However, prior works have not considered how to handle streaming data such as image sensor data generated by LIDAR devices in real-time, which means there is a risk of overflow in the network if the data are handled frame by frame. In response to this issue, we propose a blockchain framework for real-time monitoring in a smart city using image sensor networks. Our key concept with this framework is to aggregate hash values converted from multiple frames of image sensor data into one hash value. The proposed framework reduces the number of data `writes' on a blockchain network, thus preventing any overflow. Our framework also enables the estimation of the optimal number of aggregated hash values that minimizes delay while avoiding overflow. Measurements taken in actual environments using a real-world LIDAR dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9223311/,2020 2nd Conference on Blockchain Research & Applications for Innovative Networks and Services (BRAINS),28-30 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

While deep reinforcement learning has shown success in solving these perception and decision-making problems in an end-to-end manner, these algorithms require large amounts of experience to learn navigation policies from high-dimensional data, which is generally impractical for real robots due to sample complexity.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent's behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders' objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains).

The most difficulty in CPGS development is the lack of parking lots data. Without these data, the traditional well-designed parking guidance algorithms will fail. Meanwhile, the real-time location information of automobiles is increasing and can be accessed easily thanks to the popularity of smartphone and smart vehicular devices. In this paper, we propose a new idea of guiding automobiles to proper parking lots by using the data collected from the vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) device. Then we build a spatial-temporal classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with long-short term memory (LSTM) to learn the parking experience from the automobiles uploading the parking locations. Finally, we use the classifier to recommend the proper parking lots nearby to vehicles, considering the related driving context. The experiment shows the proposed method can guide automobiles to the target parking lots accurately even if we do not know the real-time data of the target parking lots. Moreover, the classifier shows the obvious spatial characteristics and preference for the first time when guiding vehicles. This method is a kind of crowdsourcing and encourages automobiles to share their parking experience, to help park easier for themselves eventually.

EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning.

Specifically, we use a novel metric called Traffic State Index (TSI) to measure regional traffic conditions, and carefully classify traffic data into three categories that are used to capture hourly, daily, and weekly traffic patterns. Furthermore, we employ the convolutional and residual neural networks to model both spatial and temporal dependencies. Experimental results from real-world traffic data demonstrate that DeepRTP outperforms five baseline methods and can achieve higher prediction accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066053/,2019 15th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN),11-13 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9005655,Detecting Pedestrian Crossing Events in Large Video Data from Traffic Monitoring Cameras,IEEE,Conferences,"Pedestrian safety on the road is a priority for transportation system managers and operators. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these are most needed remains a challenge. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are typically harder to monitor. Current practice often requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is often time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. As a result, target locations are often selected reactively, after serious traffic incidents reveal an underlying safety issue. We propose an approach to use data collected by existing traffic monitoring cameras to automatically identify pedestrian activities on the road. We propose an algorithm to detect pedestrian crossing events based on the detection of individuals on individual video frames using a deep neural network model. Resulting pedestrian locations and movement trajectories can be visualized on a background image, which is automatically extracted at the analyzed location from the video. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with a real-world use case. The case study considered in this work uses cameras owned by the City of Austin, Texas to study pedestrian road use before and after the deployment of a pedestrian-hybrid beacon. We explore qualitative and quantitative metrics to describe pedestrian activity and corresponding changes, which may be used to prioritize the deployment of pedestrian safety solutions, or evaluate their performance. We compared the number of crossing events detected per hour with manually reviewed results from a selected day. The result shows 67 percent overall accuracy, although we observe significant variability across times-of-day. Despite observed limitations, our work illustrates how the value of existing traffic camera networks can be augmented beyond everyday traffic monitoring, and used to collect valuable information on road usage by pedestrians.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005655/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Making an appropriate layoff plan is always quite difficult since a bad job cutting has a serious impact on not only the organization but also the business process executing efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of making an optimal layoff plan with the least influence on the executing of the business process. The key challenge is estimating the process throughput under a layoff plan. We overcome this challenge by two steps: regressing the activity throughput by the stuff number and inferring process throughput by the maximum flow or minimum cut algorithm on the Directed Acyclic Graph of process. In the regressing step, a kernel autoregressive hybrid model is proposed, whose MSE is 30% lower than SVM. After that, an augmenting path based algorithm is introduced to make an optimal layoff plan.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

10.1109/SASO.2014.22,Estimating p-Values for Deviation Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"Deviation detection is important for self-monitoring systems. To perform deviation detection well requires methods that, given only ""normal"" data from a distribution of unknown parametric form, can produce a reliable statistic for rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e. evidence for devating data. One measure of the strength of this evidence based on the data is the p-value, but few deviation detection methods utilize p-value estimation. We compare three methods that can be used to produce p-values: one class support vector machine (OCSVM), conformal anomaly detection (CAD), and a simple ""most central pattern"" (MCP) algorithm. The SVM and the CAD method should be able to handle a distribution of any shape. The methods are evaluated on synthetic data sets to test and illustrate their strengths and weaknesses, and on data from a real life self-monitoring scenario with a city bus fleet in normal traffic. The OCSVM has a Gaussian kernel for the synthetic data and a Hellinger kernel for the empirical data. The MCP method uses the Mahalanobis metric for the synthetic data and the Hellinger metric for the empirical data. The CAD uses the same metrics as the MCP method and has a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) non-conformity measure for both sets. The conclusion is that all three methods give reasonable, and quite similar, results on the real life data set but that they have clear strengths and weaknesses on the synthetic data sets. The MCP algorithm is quick and accurate when the ""normal"" data distribution is unimodal and symmetric (with the chosen metric) but not otherwise. The OCSVM is a bit cumbersome to use to create (quantized) p-values but is accurate and reliable when the data distribution is multimodal and asymmetric. The CAD is also accurate for multimodal and asymmetric distributions. The experiment on the vehicle data illustrate how algorithms like these can be used in a self-monitoring system that uses a fleet of vehicles to conduct deviation detection without supervision and without prior knowledge about what is being monitored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7001005/,2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems,8-12 Sept. 2014,ieeexplore

Yet, the EC being regionally domestic with a smaller scale, faces the challenges of bandwidth and computational throughput. Resource management techniques are considered necessary to achieve efficient resource allocation objectives. Software Defined Network (SDN) enabled EC architecture is emerging as a potential solution that enables dynamic bandwidth allocation and task scheduling for latency sensitive and diverse mobile applications in the EC environment. This study proposes a novel Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based flow-level dynamic bandwidth allocation framework and validates it through end-to-end implementation using OpenFlow meter feature. OpenFlow meter provides granular control and allows demand-based flow management to meet the diverse QoS requirements germane to IoT traffics. The proposed framework is then evaluated by emulating an EC scenario based on real NSF COSMOS testbed topology at The City College of New York. A specific heuristic reinforcement learning with linear-annealing technique and a pruning principle are proposed and compared with the baseline approach. Our proposed strategy performs consistently in both Mininet and hardware OpenFlow switches based environments. The performance evaluation considers key metrics associated with real-time applications: throughput, end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and overall system cost for bandwidth allocation. Furthermore, our proposed linear annealing method achieves faster convergence rate and better reward in terms of system cost, and the proposed pruning principle remarkably reduces control traffic in the network.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9590326/,2021 8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud),23-25 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/BigData.2018.8622381,Guiding the Data Learning Process with Physical Model in Air Pollution Inference,IEEE,Conferences,"The surveillance of air pollution is becoming a highly concerned issue for city residents and urban administrators. Fixed air quality stations as well as mobile gas sensors have been deployed for air quality monitoring but with sparse observations over the entire temporal-spatial space. Therefore, an inference algorithm is essential for comprehensive fine-grained air pollution sensing. Conventional physically-based models can hardly be applied to all the scenarios, while pure data-driven methods suffer from sampling bias and overfitting problems. This paper presents a hybrid algorithm for air pollution inference by guiding the data learning process with physical model. The quantitative combination of knowledge from observed dataset and a discretized convective-diffusion model is performed within a multi-task learning scheme. Evaluations show that, benefited from physical guidance, our hybrid method obtains higher extrapolation ability and more robustness, achieving the same performance with 1/8 sample amount and obtaining 31.9% less error in noisy synthesized environment. In a real-world deployment in Tianjin, our algorithm outperforms the pure data-driven model with 9.69% less inference error over a 9-day PM<sub>2.5</sub> data collection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622381/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

Traditional demand prediction methods mostly considered about inter-regional traffic, events, activities, and weather, while they overlooked the influence of other travel modes, such as metro. In this paper, we propose a Deep Taxi-Metro Spatial-Temporal Network framework, namely TMST-Net, to model the spatiotemporal relationships between the taxi demand and the metro crowd flows. In detail, we apply residual neural networks to model temporal (current, day, and week) properties of the taxi demand in each area. For each feature, we apply residual convolutional units to handle the spatial properties of taxi demand. Likewise, we apply the same method to model the metro crowd flows. TMST-Net learns to assign different weights between taxi and metro by aggregating the output of the three residual neural networks and the external factors to forecast the final taxi demand for each area in the next timestamp.

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions. The LSTM learns the temporal dependencies in the encoded air pollutant data for PM2.5 concentration forecasting.

While systems have been developed to enable visibility into parking space vacancies for drivers, most rely on costly, dedicated sensor devices that require high installation costs. The proliferation of inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables the use of compute platforms with integrated cameras that could be used to monitor parking space occupancy. However, even with camera-captured images, manual specification of parking space locations is required before such devices can be used by drivers after device installation. In this paper, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop a method to dynamically identify parking space topologies based on parked vehicle positions. More specifically, we designed and evaluated an occupation detection model to identify vacant parking spaces. We built a prototype implementation of the whole system using a Raspberry Pi and evaluated it on a real-world urban street near the University of Washington campus. The results show that our clustering-based learning technique coupled with our occupation detection pipeline is able to correctly identify parking spaces and determine occupancy without manual specication of parking space locations with an accuracy of 91%.

Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities.

However, when the road network of the city is very complicated and dense, which is usually the case, it will take too long for the algorithm to find the shortest path. Furthermore, in reality, things are not as simple as those stated in network theory. For instance, the cost of travel for the same part of the city at different times may not be the same. In this project, we have integrated Dijkstra's algorithm with a knowledge-based approach and case-based reasoning in solving the problem. With this integration, knowledge about the geographical information and past cases are used to help Dijkstra's algorithm in finding a solution.

A standard pose-graph SLAM system adds a new entry for every new pose into the location database, which grows linearly and unbounded in time and thus becomes unsustainable. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new map-reduction approach that pre-constructs a fixed-size place-recognition database amenable to the limited storage and processing resources of the vehicle by exploiting the high-level structure of the environment as well as the vehicle motion. In particular, we introduce the concept of location utility - which encapsulates the visitation probability of a location and its spatial distribution relative to nearby locations in the database - as a measure of the value of potential loop-closure events to occur at that location. While finding the optimal reduced location database is NP-hard, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm to sort all the locations in a map based on their relative utility without access to sensor measurements or the vehicle trajectory. This enables pre-determination of a generic, limited-size place-recognition database containing the N best locations in the environment. To validate the proposed approach, we develop an open-source street-map simulator using real city-map data and show that an accurate map (pose-graph) can be attained even when using a place-recognition database with only 1% of the entries of the corresponding full database.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7139223/,2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA),26-30 May 2015,ieeexplore

Integrated with mobile crowdsourcing (MCS), radio map can be updated by mobile users in a low-cost manner. However, the crowdsourced measurement data may get quite sparse, and contain noises and errors. Therefore, how to efficiently infer missing data under low-quality measurements is critical in crowdsourced radio map construction. Existing inference methods like matrix completion require certain strict conditions, e.g. missing at completely random (MACR), which is impractical in the city-scale sensing. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning scheme based on adversarial auto-encoder (AAE) to handle measurements with large missing regions and complicated loss patterns. Specifically, this scheme applies variational auto-encoder (VAE) to infer missing data, and further utilizes the adversarial nets to play a min-max game with the VAE to improve recovery quality.

Existing taxi ridesharing schemes, however, are not efficient and practical, due to they simply match ride requests and taxis based on partial trip information and omit the offline passengers, who hail a taxi at roadside with no explicit requests to the system. In this paper, we consider the mobility-aware taxi ridesharing problem, and present mT- Share to address these limitations. mT-Share fully exploits the mobility information of ride requests and taxis to achieve efficient indexing of taxis/requests and better passenger-taxi matching, while still satisfying the constraints on passengers' deadlines and taxis' capacities. Specifically, mT-Share indexes taxis and ride requests with both geographical information and travel directions, and supports the shortest path based routing and probabilistic routing to serve both online and offline ride requests. Extensive experiments with a large real-world taxi dataset demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of mT-Share, which can response each ride request in milliseconds and with a moderate detour cost.

Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (GCC-MARL) framework, which helps FHVs make distributed routing decisions that cooperatively optimize the system-wide global objective. Specifically, GCC-MARL meticulously assigns credits to agents in the training process to effectively stimulate cooperation, represents agents' actions by a carefully chosen statistics to cope with the variable agent scales, and integrates graph convolution to capture useful spatial features from complex large-scale urban road networks. We conduct extensive experiments with a real-world dataset collected in Shenzhen, China, containing around 1 million trajectories and 50 thousand orders of 553 taxis per-day from June 1st to 30th, 2017.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore

However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services. Inspired by the human eye, PDSProxy++ is based on a central cone (foveal vision) and a surrounding smaller circle (peripheral vision), which determine the nearby IoT devices to be initialized.

10.1109/BigData.2017.8258322,Practical approach to evacuation planning via network flow and deep learning,IEEE,Conferences,"In this paper, we propose a practical approach to evacuation planning by utilizing network flow and deep learning algorithms. In recent years, large amounts of data are rapidly being stored in the cloud system, and effective data utilization for solving real-world problems is required more than ever. Hierarchical Data Analysis and Optimization System (HDAOS) enables us to select appropriate algorithms according to the degree of difficulty in solving problems and a given time for the decision-making process, and such selection helps address real-world problems. In the field of emergency evacuation planning, however, the Lexicographically Quickest Flow (LQF) algorithm has an extremely long computation time on a large-scale network, and is therefore not a practical solution. For Osaka city, which is the second-largest city in Japan, we must solve the maximum flow problems on a large-scale network with over 8.3M nodes and 32.8M arcs for obtaining an optimal plan. Consequently, we can feed back nothing to make an evacuation plan. To solve the problem, we utilize the optimal solution as training data of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We train a CNN by using the results of the LQF algorithm in normal time, and in emergencies predict the evacuation completion time (ECT) immediately by the well-learned CNN. Our approach provides almost precise ECT, achieving an average regression error of about 2%. We provide several techniques for combining LQF with CNN and addressing numerous movements as CNN's input, which has rarely been considered in previous studies. Hodge decomposition also demonstrates that LQF is efficient from the standpoint of the total distance traveled by all evacuees, which reinforces the validity of the method of utilizing the LQF algorithm for deep learning.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8258322/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),11-14 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore

10.1109/InnoTek.2014.6877371,Preventing recreational boating fatalities and serious injuries with: The ANN (Assistant Naval Navigator) System Enterprise,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the significant increase in motor vehicle fatalities due to texting while driving, several US States are implementing or drafting laws that will outright ban the use of handheld devices (“I” and cell Phones, pads, business communicators, etc.) while operating a motor vehicle. At the same time, US recreational boaters already are burdened with high numbers of fatal and injurious accidents, and are being encouraged to navigate using Internet-based APPs that require texting. Our analyses of trends in recent US Coast Guard's (USCG's) Boating Statistics<sup>1</sup> seem to support that accidents due to inattention are on the rise. Specifically, owner/operator inattention is causing a higher number of collisions with other recreational boats and these are accompanied by a related rise in fatalities per collision. This observation is in-line with the US Dept. of Transportation findings that texting while driving leads to more violent accidents; therefore, more fatalities/accident. Review of recent years of USCG Boating Statistics (2004 thru 2012, subsequent to the beginning of the fuel crisis) yielded several interesting conclusions. Using data 2012 as a benchmark, there were 4,515 recreational boating accidents resulting in 651 fatalities. In 73% of these fatal accidents, the owner/operators had no USCG approved instruction. Also alarming, in 13% of the 4515 accidents the cause was owner/operator inattention. Add to this, in 1010 accidents of the 4,515, these involved a collision with another recreational boat! (That's over 22% of the total accidents). It's shocking to realize that the number of moms, dads, young men and women and children that are dying and seriously injured per year, while enjoying this recreational activity, was nearly equaled the yearly US troop losses and serious injuries during the Iraq war. Over 10 years ago we began our design effort by assembling a team of experts having experience with on-water Emergency Response, and marine-related technologies. By then, the author and his direct associate had accumulated more than 70 years of successful installation and start-up of computer-based control systems for very large and small processes. The applications included major metals, chemical, plastics, ore-processing, underground coal mining industries, as well as, a medical enterprise application. We envisioned how the vessel navigation process may be adapted to feedforward/feedback control system architecture in real time. Proceeding on this basis, our team met frequently with system integrators, boat and engine manufacturers, Boat Owners Association of the US (BoatUS) Execs, towing station owner/operators and US Coast Guard Certified “A” Captains and pilots. In these meetings, our goal continued to focus on a plan for applying advanced control theory to enhance marine vessel navigation. This plan is now in readiness for productization - a viable, developed and US Patented <sup>2</sup> system with primary missions of life-saving and/serious injury prevention. Think of it!

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8473390/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree.

Within this project, a keyword spotting algorithm has been developed which markedly improves the recognizer's performance on embedded speech.

This urban driving requires zero error tolerance. In order to guarantee safety requirements self-driving cars and the used software have to pass exhaustive tests under as many different conditions as possible. The more versatile the considered influences and the more thorough the tests made under those influences, the safer the car will drive under real conditions. Unfortunately, it is very time and resource intensive to record the same test set of images over and over again, every time producing, or hoping for, specific conditions; especially when using real test vehicles. This is where environment simulation comes into play. This research investigates the simulation of environmental influences which may affect the sensors used in autonomous vehicles, in particular how raindrops resting on a windshield affect cameras as they may occlude large parts of the field of view. We propose a novel method to render these raindrops using Continuous Nearest Neighbor search leveraging the benefits of R-trees. The 3D scene in front of the camera, which is generated from stereo images, reflects physically correct in these drops. This leads to near photo-realistic simulated results.

Moreover, traffic lights' shapes are also similar to advertisement lights in a city road.

Since GPS does not work very accurately inside the buildings, for indoor navigation problem we still have to depend on the traditional front desk human resource consultation. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has made it possible for smart car navigation instead of the manual consultation. Not only that, smart cars can even handle short-distance goods transportation. Combining indoor positioning technology with different video signals or any other non-GPS satellite positioning technology for directing the smart car to the designated position is a hot research direction these days. In this paper, we mainly study the realization and application of a smart car in the indoor automated driving system. Our proposed smart car, built using the Raspberry Pi 3, uses a series of famous path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Best priority search and A*(A star) algorithm to plan the driving path of the car's automatic driving.

The low accuracy of such sensors also motivates the need for data-driven calibration models that can accurately predict the science variables from the raw sensor signals. Here, we offer our experiences with designing and deploying such an IoT software platform and calibration models, and validate it through a pilot field deployment at two mega-cities, Delhi and Mumbai.

10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00029,STAD: Spatio-Temporal Adjustment of Traffic-Oblivious Travel-Time Estimation,IEEE,Conferences,"Travel time estimation is an important component in modern transportation applications. The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed graph, then apply Dijkstra-like algorithms to find shortest paths. Travel time is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine, before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of the basic routing engine. Experiments on real trip datasets from Doha, New York City, and Porto show a reduction in median absolute errors of 14% in the first two cities and 29% in the latter.

This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICNN.1994.375034,The ordering-oriented Hopfield network,IEEE,Conferences,"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well known problem which can be solved using Hopfield networks. The TSP solution with Hopfield networks is based on the uniqueness constraint. This is, each city must be visited once and only once while trying to minimize the travelling distance. But in real world applications, usually there are other equally important constraints needing to be considered. For example, an ordering constraint on how cities are to be visited. This paper proposes a modified Hopfield neural network architecture that can solve a new class of optimization problem, called ""the picking stone problem (PSP)"". The PSP requires not only the uniqueness but also the ordering constraints. The neural network implementation to solve PSP tends to turn on neurons which satisfy the ordering constraint and this constraint is essential in solving the stereo correspondence problem in binocular vision and can be applied to many other pattern recognition problems. In this paper the authors define the PSP, formulate its computational complexity, propose the ordering-oriented neural network architecture, discuss the performance of the proposed network by the traditional random initialization method, and propose a new initialization method to improve the performance of the network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/375034/,Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94),28 June-2 July 1994,ieeexplore

Vehicle counting, in particular, has become a key element of vision-based intelligent traffic systems deployed across metropolitan areas. Most methods solved the vehicle counting problem under the assumption of state-of-the-art computing systems. However, large-scale deployment of such systems for multi-camera processing is very inefficient. With the recent advancement of cost-efficient Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices alongside machine learning methods developed specifically for such devices, solving the vehicle counting problem for real-time traffic analysis on IoT edge devices, and thereby facilitating its large-scale deployment have become highly favorable.

The traffic signal light controlling part was the second part of the project. This part dealt with estimating a better timing adjustment for the existing system using a mathematical modeling approach while taking the extracted traffic index as input.

10.1109/ICSESS52187.2021.9522158,Visual Loop Closure Detection Based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and Product Quantization,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile robots rely heavily on the creation of the scene map and the positioning in the map in an unknown environment, but no matter what type of map is created, it is inevitably affected by cumulative errors. This presents a huge challenge for loop closure detection technology. Using traditional loop closure detection methods to perform scene recognition is difficult to extract the appearance changes caused by time, weather, or seasonal conditions in the image and deep semantic information, and the speed of extracting image features is slow, which is difficult to meet the real-time performance of robots. Because of the success of deep convolutional neural networks(CNN), it is possible to enrich the information of image features. First of all, this paper uses the pre-trained CNN model SSE-Net to extract the deep visual appearance and semantic features of the image, and obtain the feature description vector. Then, after product quantization(PQ) and encoding, the final pair of candidate frames is quickly searched and matched to obtain the most similar pair of candidate frames and judged as a loop . After the verification of the New collage dataset and the City Center dataset, this algorithm has achieved a good Precision-Recall rate and a faster speed compared with the recently proposed large-scale convolution network VGG16 method and traditional feature extraction methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9522158/,2021 IEEE 12th International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Science (ICSESS),20-22 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

A wireless sensor network-based approach to detect car positions,IEEE,Conferences,"The global trend of increased urbanization makes space rare in city environments in general and for parking in particular. In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not. In our work, we present a sensor deployment and a machine learning-based approach able to provide the mentioned more fine-granular detection level. We have conducted an extensive real-world evaluation of our solution, in particular considering different characteristics of today's car bodies.

However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146646/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS).

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983383,A Machine Learning Framework for Sleeping Cell Detection in a Smart-City IoT Telecommunications Infrastructure,IEEE,Journals,"The smooth operation of largely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) applications will depend on, among other things, effective infrastructure failure detection. Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage).

The problem remains that such trust is notoriously difficult to guarantee in the presence of systematic faults, e.g., non-traceable errors caused by machine learning functions. One way to tackle this issue without making rather specific assumptions about the perception process is plausibility checking. Similar to the reasoning of human intuition, the final outcome of a complex black-box procedure is verified against given expectations of an object's behavior. In this article, we apply and evaluate collaborative, sensor-generic plausibility checking as a mean to detect empirical perception faults from their statistical fingerprints. Our real use case is next-generation automated driving that uses a roadside sensor infrastructure for perception augmentation, represented here by test scenarios at a German highway and a city intersection.

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules.

Deployment of the Internet of Things-based sensors has considerably changed the dynamics of predicting air quality. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for pollution prediction; however, comparative analysis of these techniques is required to have a better understanding of their processing time for multiple datasets. In this paper, we have performed pollution prediction using four advanced regression techniques and present a comparative study to determine the best model for accurately predicting air quality with reference to data size and processing time. We have conducted experiments using Apache Spark and performed pollution estimation using multiple datasets. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) have been used as evaluation criteria for the comparison of these regression models. Furthermore, the processing time of each technique through standalone learning and through fitting the hyperparameter tuning on Apache Spark has also been calculated to find the best-fit model in terms of processing time and lowest error rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8746201/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

These requirements introduce great challenges in the air interface and protocol stack design, resource allocation, network deployment, and all the way up to mobile (or multi-access) edge computing (MEC), cloud and application layer. In this paper, we present a cooperative autonomous driving oriented MEC-aided 5G-V2X prototype system design and the rationale behind the design choices. The prototype system is developed based on a next-generation radio access network (NG-RAN) experimental platform, a cooperative driving vehicle platoon, and an MEC server providing high definition (HD) 3D dynamic map service. Field tests are conducted and the results demonstrate that the combination of 5G-V2X, MEC and cooperative autonomous driving can be pretty powerful. Considering the remaining challenges in the commercial deployment of 5G-V2X networks and future researches, we propose two artificial intelligence (AI) based optimization tools. The first is a deep-learning-based tool called deep spatio-temporal residual networks with a permutation operator (PST-ResNet). By providing city-wide user and network traffic prediction, PST-ResNet can help to reduce the capital expense (CAPEX) and operating expense (OPEX) costs of commercial 5G-V2X networks. The second is a swarm intelligence based optimization tool called subpopulation collaboration based dynamic self-adaption cuckoo Search (SC-DSCS), which can be widely used to solve complex optimization problems in future researches.

A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in CO<sub>x</sub> sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far.

Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8972481/,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,July 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2442584,Estimation of Seismic Vulnerability Levels of Urban Structures With Multisensor Remote Sensing,IEEE,Journals,"The ongoing global transformation of human habitats from rural villages to ever growing urban agglomerations induces unprecedented seismic risks in earthquake prone regions. To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R &gt; 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ &gt; 0.6 up to κ &gt; 0.8). Overall, analyzes provide very promising empirical evidence, which confirms the potential of remote sensing to support seismic vulnerability assessment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7150321/,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,May 2016,ieeexplore

Unfortunately, the hidden information is likely to be predicted by various powerful inference attacks with the rapid advances in machine learning. Then, what is the risk that a user's private information could be disclosed? What countermeasures can be taken to fight against the privacy violation for the user? To tackle these issues, this article proposes a general Framework for Private Attribute Disclosure estimation (F-PAD) including three steps: 1) private attribute prediction; 2) disclosure model training; 3) disclosure risk estimation. Not like most prior risk estimation studies focusing on one specific attack model and private attribute, F-PAD can estimate disclosure risk for individual users in terms of disclosure probability and risk level within a high confidence given a basket of potential inference attack models; furthermore, F-PAD can adapt to various attributes (e.g., gender, age) and offer countermeasures to help users lower the risk. Extensive experiment studies on two real social network datasets, Facebook and Book-Crossing, have verified the effectiveness of F-PAD in `current city', `gender' and `age' disclosure risk estimation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8895669/,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1 Nov.-Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results.

First of all, we split each user's tweet timeline temporally into a number of clusters, each tending to imply a distinct location. Subsequently, we adapt two machine learning models to our setting and design classifiers that classify each tweet cluster into one of the pre-defined location classes at the city level. The Bayes based model focuses on the information gain of words with location implications in the user-generated contents. The convolutional LSTM model treats user-generated contents and their associated locations as sequences and employs bidirectional LSTM and convolution operation to make location inferences.

The comparison has been performed according to the data collected in a dozen of garages in the area of Florence by using Sii-Mobility National Research Project and Km4City infrastructure. The resulting solution has demonstrated that a Bayesian regularized neural network exploiting historical data, weather condition, and traffic flow data can offer a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available slots in terms of flexibility and robustness to critical cases.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082641,Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition Based on Edge Computing,IEEE,Journals,"In recent years, many large-scale information systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) can be converted into interdependent sensor networks, such as smart cities, smart medical systems, and industrial Internet systems. The successful application of edge computing in the IoT will make our algorithms faster, more convenient, lower overall costs, providing better business practices, and enhance sustainability. Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area. According to the detected facial feature points, we could calculate the values of AU, and then use classification algorithms for emotion recognition. In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production. Therefore, we designed a lightweight edge computing-based distributed system using Raspberry Pi tailed for this need, and we optimized the data transfer and components deployment. In the vicinity, the front-end and back-end processing modes are separated to reduce round-trip delay, thereby completing complex computing tasks and providing high-reliability, large-scale connection services. For IoT or smart city applications and services, they can be made into smart sensing systems that can be deployed anywhere with network connections.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438728/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

Time and road risk index (RRI) are considered as metrics to be balanced based on user preference. To evaluate road segment risk, a road and accident database from the highway safety information system is mined with a hybrid neural network model to predict RRI. Real-time factors such as time of day, day of the week, and weather are included as correction factors to the static RRI prediction. With real-time RRI and expected travel time, route planning is formulated as a multiobjective network flow problem and further reduced to a mixed-integer programming problem. A V2C2V implementation of our safety-based route planning approach is proposed to facilitate access to real-time information and computing resources. A real-world case study, route planning through the city of Columbus, Ohio, is presented.

Parking management departments around the world focus on intelligent parking system in order to solve parking problems, but most of them are limited to upgrading the parking infrastructure. There is no effective solution from a perspective of the fundamental cause to solve the parking problem. At present, it is generally believed that parking guidance systems can effectively alleviate parking problems and provide drivers and traffic managers with real-time and accurate parking information. As one of the prerequisites of the parking guidance system, the accuracy of the short-term parking demand prediction method determines whether the implementation of the parking guidance scheme can effectively solve the parking problem in a certain area. Based on this, we have studied a short-term parking demand prediction in this paper. First, focusing on the distribution of typical parking arrivals and departures regular pattern, a parking demand prediction model was constructed utilizing the Markov birth and death process, and model parameters were calibrated utilizing curve fitting method and undetermined coefficients method. The simulation environment was set up utilizing the Markov process to verify the accuracy of the availability of parameter estimation method. Secondly, a method for determining the prediction interval based on the parking trend was given for different situations with the parking rush hours and ordinary hours which parking arrival and departure parameters were different. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in practical applications, parking arrival and departure data from June 17 to June 23, 2019 in Jilin University of Nanling Campus was used to verify the short-term parking demand prediction method proposed in this paper. The results show that the parking demand prediction model proposed in this paper can accurately calibrate model parameters, predict parking demand quickly and effectively and provide theoretical reference and technical support for parking planning and management.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9016013/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

TourSense demonstrates how the transport data can overcome these limitations and provide better insights for different stakeholders, typically including tour agencies, transport operators, and tourists themselves. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based iterative propagation learning algorithm to recognize tourists from public commuters. Taking advantage of the trace data from the identified tourists, we then design a tourist preference analytics model to learn and predict their next tour, where an interactive user interface is implemented to ease the information access and gain the insights from the analytics results.

In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap.

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in-or moving through-the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors.

Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space.

Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure.

But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications.

These systems can be thought of as the cities' vision organs. It is anticipated that smart cities will produce a massive amount of data. Thus, to ensure the safety of its people, it is essential to conduct an efficient and real-time analysis of these data in order to receive timely responses in the event of catastrophic incidents. As a result, the process of transferring this vast data to the cloud for processing is relatively slow. In this paper, we present the software perspective to design and implement EFISS, a multilayer computing-based architecture for an intelligent, resource-efficient, and real-time surveillance system for smart cities. The framework, which is comprised of edge-fog computational layers, would help in the prevention of crime and the prediction of criminal incidents in smart cities.

Urban airspace will include many more Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware.

Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities. Since most flood casualties are caused by a lack of information on the impending flood (type, location, and severity), sensing these events is critical to generate accurate and detailed warnings and short term forecasts. However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented.

Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal.

The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in big data analytics (BDA) technologies have provided an open opportunity to develop highly needed disaster resilient smart city environments. In this paper, we propose and discuss the novel reference architecture and philosophy of a disaster resilient smart city (DRSC) through the integration of the IoT and BDA technologies. The proposed architecture offers a generic solution for disaster management activities in smart city incentives. A combination of the Hadoop Ecosystem and Spark are reviewed to develop an efficient DRSC environment that supports both real-time and offline analysis. The implementation model of the environment consists of data harvesting, data aggregation, data pre-processing, and big data analytics and service platform. A variety of datasets (i.e., smart buildings, city pollution, traffic simulator, and twitter) are utilized for the validation and evaluation of the system to detect and generate alerts for a fire in a building, pollution level in the city, emergency evacuation path, and the collection of information about natural disasters (i.e., earthquakes and tsunamis).

Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving.

10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441582,A Real-Time Deep Transfer Learning Model for Facial Mask Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rise of COVID-19, wearing masks in public areas has become paramount to preventing the transmission of the coronavirus, Furthermore, many public service providers may require customers to properly wear masks in order to be served. But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people's faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials.As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4]. Masks have since been required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, transportation hubs such as airports and stations [5].However, Machine Learning and Deep Learning can help to combat Covid-19 in many ways. Enabling researchers and clinicians to evaluate a vast amount of data to make various predictions. In particular, face mask detection may prove to be useful as a guide for government surveillance on people in public areas susceptible to transmission, to ensure that face mask regulations are upheld. To achieve this, deep learning binary classification facial mask model based on VGG19 and one-shot object detection methods will be trained.We contribute a dual face-and-mask detection system that can provide immediate feedback in live surveillance systems. The method introduced is fast and accurate and can work for live mask-checking in busy public areas, alleviating some of the human effort and error typically subject to the mask mandating task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9441582/,2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS),19-23 April 2021,ieeexplore

Train rescheduling is such a problem in plan revision. In this kind of problem, the AI system's output can not be used without human acceptance. And a person such as the train dispatcher has to be responsible for the acceptance of the output. Further, situations dynamically change in real-time. Thus, the central problem here is to let him quickly grasp and accept the AI system's suggestions. Focussing on such problems, this paper presents an AI coordination technique especially for plan revision consisting of: a flexible and hierarchical representation mechanism for goal decomposition and its alternative attainment knowledge, for solving complex problems through divide and conquer; dynamic goal generation, goal prioritizing, and its concurrent achievement through preemption, for solving dynamic problems; a fine-grained goal coordination mechanism for a real time complex system; and a man-machine coordination mechanism for quick user acceptance (rule-type knowledge representation for encapsulating multiple suggestions such as for proposing alternative suggestions together and/or for proposing subordinate suggestions together to solve side effects).

A fully memoized hierarchical routing algorithm pre-computes and stores the shortest-path data structure and the shortest-path-cost data structure for the graph fragments, as well as for the boundary graph. The storage cost of the fully memoized approach can be reduced by a virtual or a hybrid memoization approach, where few or none of the relevant data structures have been pre-computed.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources.

Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP).

Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event. To address this limitation, we proposed a BERT-based Adversarial Domain Adaptation model (BERT-ADA) for crisis tweet classification.

This is an important and foreseeable real world application, not only because cities have been viewed as centers of gravity by military planners throughout history, but also because the military significance of cities has increased proportionally as the global urbanization does. We first present a mapping between the domain of engineering research and that of the agent models present in the literature and use genetic multi-objective optimization method to generate Pareto TPS plans. Further we study the importance of forming diverse teams when aggregating opinions of different problem solvers for tactical position selection, and also the relationships of the number of problem solvers with time ratio and the solution efficiency. We show that a diverse team of problem solvers is able to provide better force deployment plans for early-stage decision makers to choose from. We also find that opinion aggregation methods, like approval voting, help to allocate a difficult problem solving among several computing resources, and at the same time ensuring the efficiency of solutions.

The goal is to make smart cities to be created by heuristic algorithms on the real maps to perform some tasks through TSP. Therefore, Hill Climbing heuristic search algorithm which is generally used for mathematical optimization problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has been preferred in this study. This application takes a city from the OpenStreetMap (OSM), which is a real map as an input given to the algorithm, and calculates a path to visit all the nodes on the related route.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution. For example, our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate number.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8457691/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously.

These global models and their assumptions are at odds with evidence that the relationship between crime and criminogenic factors is not homogeneous across space. In response to this gap, we present area-specific crime prediction models based on hierarchical and multi-task statistical learning.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

The common reason is the public waiting for bus. Buses/lorries are the common vehicle use in transportation for short distances in cities. People usually have tendency to stand outside the bus stop on the road. This blocks the way for the bus to stop in front of the bus stop and so it has to stop in the middle of the road, blocking the traffic. Presented research work is focused to inform and aware people to stand inside the bus stop. For that three different methods are implemented. First one is by using image processing. This is working in real time. It detects the face of people standing on road and raise pre-recorded voice when observed for five second continuously. The second is by using ultrasonic sensors. This will send ultrasonic wave using transmitter and receive the wave from receiver. The time elapsed between the transmission of wave and receiving of wave is entered as an input.

The purpose of designing PRN is to provide as rich information as possible for each single layer. During the training phase, we propose to propagate gradient combinations rather than feature combinations. PRN can be easily applied in many existing network architectures, such as ResNet, feature pyramid network, etc., and can effectively improve their performance. Nowadays, more advanced DCNs are designed with the hierarchical semantic information of multiple layers, so the model will continue to deepen and expand. Due to the neat design of PRN, it can benefit all models, especially for lightweight models. In the MSCOCO object detection experiments, YOLO-v3-PRN maintains the same accuracy as YOLO-v3 with a 55% reduction of parameters and 35% reduction of computation, while increasing the speed of execution by twice. For lightweight models, YOLO-v3-tiny-PRN maintains the same accuracy under the condition of 37% less parameters and 38% less computation than YOLO-v3-tiny and increases the frame rate by up to 12 fps on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example.

Inspired by fog computing, this paper proposes a data compression scheme based on fog computing architecture, which uses the synchronous prediction model to achieve data reduction. The fog node constructs a synchronous prediction model by using an auto-regressive analysis method and fits the characteristics of the sensor data so that the data stream can be reduced from the source node. Considering the complexity of the WSN deployment environment, an environment adaptive variable threshold optimization strategy is proposed to improve the availability and performance of the model.

Basically, the main problem in traffic light control is having to make right decisions sequentially. One method that matches the characteristics of these problem is a Reinforcement Learning (RL). With this background and the results of previous studies, the author has developed a simulation application about Intelligent Traffic Light Control with Collaborative Q-Learning Algorithms methods. The purpose of this research is to optimize the waiting time at traffic light control based on method of collaborative Q-Learning that can be used as a reference model for the solution of traffic congestion in real world. Based on test results, it can be concluded that the Collaborative Q-Learning Algorithms is the best traffic light control algorithms among the other method tested with a waiting time is 54.67 seconds. The simulation process is using Green Light District Simulator. The test results showed that the best parameters for Collaborative Q-Learning algorithms method are the learning rate is 1 and the discount factor is 0.8, and, the immediate reward method is results of the subtraction of the waiting time before, and the waiting time at the moment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7571925/,2016 4th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT),25-27 May 2016,ieeexplore

In the IoT, heterogeneous devices are connected to sense the environment or to observe individual tasks. Many research fields use the seamless IoT infrastructure to interact with the integrated devices and diverse services. Furthermore, IoT is a promising technology to increase the comfort and quality of life and opens new ways of interaction between people and things. Real life applications in healthcare sectors, home automation, industry, smart cities, monitoring scenarios, etc. benefit from the low-cost wireless technology in IoT on one hand. On the contrary, IoT system has many challenging features: many devices are resource-constrained with energy and memory, are highly heterogeneous and their applications continuously transmit transient information. Furthermore, Requesting, delivering and updating the information in IoT are challenging because of the resource limitation. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the latest and the most important Information-Centric Networking (ICN) approaches which uses named data to deliver data in the network. Based on hierarchically structured names, NDN matches the application pattern of IoT systems and uses its communication concept to optimize the power supply and distribute the data efficiently in the network. This paper discusses the main concepts of NDN including naming, routing, forwarding and caching in IoT infrastructure. To achieve an efficient system in different applications scenario in future IoT, an IoT architecture is proposed via NDN called IoT-NDN.

Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1) a learning-based decision-making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is ≈6000× faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore

It has been shown that IoT devices typically lack appropriate security measures embedded, and hence are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Also, these devices are heterogeneous in their network communications that makes it difficult for operators of smart environments to manage them at scale. Existing monitoring solutions may perform well in certain environments, however, they do not scale cost-effectively and are inflexible to changes due to their static use of models.

The proposed method consists of three stages of neural networks connected in a modular fashion. The first stage is the detection of license plates (LP); after that, RILP proceeds to detect text regions and performs character segmentations. Finally, to get to the LP number, optical character recognition (OCR) is done via a neural network previously trained for recognition of Persian characters. A robust LPR platform is a vital tool in modern cities for a variety of applications such as autonomous terrific management, surveillance, gateway control and etc. In order to be deployed in real-world conditions, LPR platforms should be practical and adaptive; in other words, easily trainable. RILP has paid attention to this matter as it can be effortlessly trained for any national LP. Only the final module of this approach requires training, which can be done with a simple dataset of the characters used in the LP of the desired country.

Our proposed model of automation in the detection and recognizing vehicles through the use of number plate computerization is expected to create a new scope of evolution for large cities. The system can be used for the parking system of motor vehicles, as well as to collect tolls. The detection of the Bangla number plates from different cities and multi-class vehicles is the first step of the proposed system. The number plate detection has been performed with the computer vision approach, and the You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3) algorithm. Next, the Tesseract optical character recognition system, in conjunction with the Bangla character recognition model, has been used for vehicle indexing and convolutional neural network for the character recognition from the detected number plate. Numerical results demonstrate that the accuracies of license plate detection for the computer vision and YOLOv3 are 91% and 95%, respectively. For the character recognition, the accuracy for Tesseract and convolutional neural network are 90% if the license plate is detected and cropped successfully and 91.38%, respectively. Finally, our system has been tested using the convolutional neural network method in an environment of real-world where our system's Pi Camera captured video as input, which has a total of 18 different cars.

Natural ventilation is often a viable option for diluting indoor air pollutants, but transportation noise transmission is a crucial ecological conflict. Therefore, personal control over the concentration of outdoor/indoor air pollutants and noise levels is a significant threshold for natural ventilation availability. This study proposes real-time data detection and notification solutions using sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve indoor air quality and outdoor air quality and outdoor noise transmission. An intelligent real-time detection and notification system was implemented in a distributed computing framework with cloud and edge computing. The objective of this study is placed on three facets: (1) development of sensors and NVIDIA Jetson Nano prototype for air quality and noise level detection, (2) application of machine learning for air quality and noise level prediction and classification, and (3) web interface for real-time monitoring and prediction for air quality and noise level detection. The results showed that the proposed user interface provides building occupants with real-time data of outdoor/indoor Air Quality Index (AQI) and noise levels for the optimized occupant control over Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it. The proposed reconstruction model has been created by exploiting open and real-time data in the context of Sii-Mobility research project by using Km4City infrastructure in the area of Florence, Italy, for its corresponding Smart City solution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8512000/,"2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)",12-15 Aug. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/EDGE.2018.00028,Real-Time Traffic Pattern Collection and Analysis Model for Intelligent Traffic Intersection,IEEE,Conferences,"The traffic congestion hits most big cities in the world - threatening long delays and serious reductions in air quality. City and local government officials continue to face challenges in optimizing crowd flow, synchronizing traffic and mitigating threats or dangerous situations. One of the major challenges faced by city planners and traffic engineers is developing a robust traffic controller that eliminates traffic congestion and imbalanced traffic flow at intersections. Ensuring that traffic moves smoothly and minimizing the waiting time in intersections requires automated vehicle detection techniques for controlling the traffic light automatically, which are still challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic pattern collection and analysis model, named TPCAM, based on traffic cameras to help in smooth vehicular movement on junctions and set to reduce the traffic congestion. Our traffic detection and pattern analysis model aims at detecting and calculating the traffic flux of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections in real-time. Our system can utilize one camera to capture all the traffic flows in one intersection instead of multiple cameras, which will reduce the infrastructure requirement and potential for easy deployment. We propose a new deep learning model based on YOLOv2 and adapt the model for the traffic detection scenarios. To reduce the network burdens and eliminate the deployment of network backbone at the intersections, we propose to process the traffic video data at the network edge without transmitting the big data back to the cloud. To improve the processing frame rate at the edge, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8473390/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),2-7 July 2018,ieeexplore

In particular, real-time object recognition has become an important technology in smart cities. To achieve this, low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are the key technologies. In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, it has not been considered to increase the batch size of arrival data at edge servers ensuring low-latency transmission. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via TWDM-PONe We also propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrival at the edge.

At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These ""leaf"" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00029,STAD: Spatio-Temporal Adjustment of Traffic-Oblivious Travel-Time Estimation,IEEE,Conferences,"Travel time estimation is an important component in modern transportation applications. The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed graph, then apply Dijkstra-like algorithms to find shortest paths. Travel time is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine, before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of the basic routing engine.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information.

10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00051,Smart Energy Management System based on Reconfigurable AI Chip and Electrical Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls. The author has built a specialized laboratory to investigate machine learning technology applied to autonomous systems. In this laboratory miniature autonomous vehicles are developed. The general idea of this experimental setup allows research on new methodologies for autonomous systems in a very small scale",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373129/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp),17-20 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore

Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions. Such high-quality output can be used to continuously update a large database for surveillance and can be further used to improve the accuracy of deep models in the complex real-world scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8893132/,2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops (ICDARW),22-25 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

10.1109/ICNN.1994.375034,The ordering-oriented Hopfield network,IEEE,Conferences,"The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a well known problem which can be solved using Hopfield networks. The TSP solution with Hopfield networks is based on the uniqueness constraint. This is, each city must be visited once and only once while trying to minimize the travelling distance. But in real world applications, usually there are other equally important constraints needing to be considered. For example, an ordering constraint on how cities are to be visited. This paper proposes a modified Hopfield neural network architecture that can solve a new class of optimization problem, called ""the picking stone problem (PSP)"". The PSP requires not only the uniqueness but also the ordering constraints. The neural network implementation to solve PSP tends to turn on neurons which satisfy the ordering constraint and this constraint is essential in solving the stereo correspondence problem in binocular vision and can be applied to many other pattern recognition problems. In this paper the authors define the PSP, formulate its computational complexity, propose the ordering-oriented neural network architecture, discuss the performance of the proposed network by the traditional random initialization method, and propose a new initialization method to improve the performance of the network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/375034/,Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94),28 June-2 July 1994,ieeexplore

However, real-time anomaly detection remains a challenge. Internet of Things (IoT) is an effective platform for real-time monitoring of large-scale solar farms. Using low-cost edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi (RPI), it is possible to not only read power and irradiance values from in-situ sensors, but to also apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms for real-time analysis and for detecting anomalous behaviors. This paper presents the design and implementation of an edge analytics application that uses RPI as an edge device. The Isolation Forest algorithm was first used to detect shading anomalies. A Siamese neural network was then trained to create a latent-space mapping. An anomaly detection model based on the latent space and a neural network and kNN was developed. These models could detect shading anomalies with an F1-Score of 0.94. Embedded variants of the model based on TensorFlow Lite and TensorRT were evaluated to service a large number of solar panels at 1Hz. The results are that a single RPI could do parallel anomaly detection of 512 solar panels at 1 Hz with 0% failures.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS).

Consequently, one of the most challenging issues of a bike-sharing system is predicting the required number of shared bikes at each station. In this article, we take the real aspects of a bike-sharing system into account, e.g., the high complexity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty of the traffic flow, and propose a hybrid edge-computing-based machine learning model. Notably, our proposed model, which combines a self-organizing mapping network with a regression tree (RT), is applied to predict the bicycle demand of a certain station through the following steps: 1) the proposed model adopts self-organization mapping to assemble the original samples in the form of clusters and 2) each cluster is then built as an RT to forecast the required number of bikes at each station. Experiments based on real data from the Washington and London bike-sharing systems show that our proposed method achieves a higher prediction accuracy and better generalization than previous approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9046294/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Aug. 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293775,A Minimum Resource Neural Network Framework for Solving Multiconstraint Shortest Path Problems,IEEE,Journals,"Characterized by using minimum hard (structural) and soft (computational) resources, a novel parameter-free minimal resource neural network (MRNN) framework is proposed for solving a wide range of single-source shortest path (SP) problems for various graph types. The problems are the k-shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially processing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that the MRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than ~2% and 0.5% that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6709796/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,Aug. 2014,ieeexplore

For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques. In the given experiment results, we find that the positioning system achieves a mean positioning accuracy of 1.61 m, which represents a 36.1% improvement over traditional RSS-based fingerprinting.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8259458/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments.

In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws.

Advancing this notion to the present day, the Internet of Things (IoT) provides a unique opportunity to attempt the same in an increasingly digital landscape. The prevalence and pervasiveness of IoT data streams gives us this ability to represent a situation with clarity and nuance, leading to a refined awareness of the environment. However, there are several challenges in managing the scale, velocity, and magnitude of IoT data streams, as well as the cohesive representation of these varied sources in a single frame of reference. In this article, we present a new algorithm, the deep growing self-organizing map (deep GSOM) algorithm that addresses these challenges. Deep GSOM incrementally generates a latent representation of situational awareness from high entropy to low entropy IoT data streams. It utilizes an implementation of the fuzzy integral to define a metric that can be moved across spatial and temporal situations to profile the density of congestion. We have also expanded deep GSOM into an IoT platform that can collate, aggregate, and process an entire network of IoT data streams. We demonstrate the workings of deep GSOM on the real-life scenario of profiling vehicular and pedestrian movement using IoT data streams of two highly urbanized cities. The results of these experiments confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach for generating situational awareness from multiple IoT data streams.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8960359/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,May 2020,ieeexplore

The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems. New challenges, however, arise when IoT meets cloud—there is an urgent need for novel network architectures that seamlessly integrate them, and protocols that facilitate big data streaming from IoT to the cloud.

For cities, some unusual events may endanger public safety. If the early warning of an abnormal event can be issued, it is of great application value to urban construction services. To detect urban anomalies, this paper proposes the Hierarchical Urban Anomaly Detection (HUAD) framework. The first step in this framework is to build rough anomaly characteristics that need to be calculated by some traffic flow consisted of subway and taxi data. In the second step, the alternative abnormal regions were obtained. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to predict the traffic to get the historical anomaly scores. Following that, the refined anomaly characteristics are generated from adjacent regions, adjacent periods and historical anomalies. The final abnormal regions were detected by One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). At last, based on real data sets, we analyzes the traffic flow of the target region and adjacent regions from multiple perspectives in view of the large crowd gathering activities, and the effectiveness of the method is verified.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8979374/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state. It is accurate and efficient and can easily be applied to other traffic datasets.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8917560/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 June 2021,ieeexplore

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders.

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection.

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively.

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld.

Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area.

So far, a large number of scheduling algorithms have been developed to reduce energy consumption for executing workflows. However, most existing algorithms have obvious defects in energy and resource efficiency, because they schedule workflow tasks to hosts directly and ignore that the host is so powerful that a single workflow task cannot make full use of its resources. To resolve the issue, a new scheduling architecture is designed for cloud data centers. Then, two principles are derived: one suggests that hybrid scheduling tasks from different workflows is helpful for improving resource utilization; the other one deduces that balancing host weighted square frequencies can minimize total power consumption of active hosts under a given resource requirement. On the basis of the scheduling architecture and the two principles, an oNline schEduling AlgoriThm, namely NEAT, is proposed to schedule dynamic workflows with deadlines.

Our black-box approach maintains the positioning accuracy regardless of changes in the underlying hardware or indoor environment. To evaluate our approach, we have deployed a multistorey facility testbed and performed an extensive real-subject trial to gather the unlabeled fingerprint dataset. The proposed unsupervised method yields average location classification accuracy of 0.8 that can rise up to 0.9 when a semi-supervised approach is considered.

10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951294,Urban Commerce Distribution Analysis Based on Street View and Deep Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Urban commerce and its distribution have always been an important part of urban research. However, most previous studies were based on statistical data and did not reflect real street experience. Thanks to the Street View image and deep learning technology, researchers are able to carry out large scale studies from real human visual experience. In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software. Furthermore, the results from this study can be conveniently combined with other data because of the use of street-network-based data structure. An application of this method combines with street-network data, the calculation of a city's 15-minute commercial service circle coverage is also shown in this study.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8890683/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

In this paper, we reveal a new accelerometer-based side-channel attack which is particularly serious: malware on smartphones can easily exploit the accelerometers to trace metro riders stealthily. We first address the challenge to automatically filter out metro-related data from a mass of miscellaneous accelerometer readings, and then propose a basic attack which leverages an ensemble interval classifier built from supervised learning to infer the riding trajectory of the user. As the supervised learning requires the attacker to collect labeled training data for each station interval, this attack confronts the scalability problem in big cities with a huge metro network. We thus further present an improved attack using semi-supervised learning, which only requires the attacker to collect labeled data for a very small number of distinctive station intervals. We conduct real experiments on a large self-built dataset, which contains more than 120 h of data collected from six metro lines of three major cities. The results show that the inferring accuracy could reach 89% and 94% if the user takes the metro for four and six stations, respectively.

10.1109/ICCCN.2019.8847117,A User-Centric Mobility Management Scheme for High-Density Fog Computing Deployments,IEEE,Conferences,"The inherent mobility characterizing users in fog computing environments along with the limited wireless range of their serving fog nodes (FNs) drives the need for designing efficient mobility management (MM) mechanisms. This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios. This is shown through significant improvements in the cumulative regret as well as the instantaneous delay, compared to the case where all newly-appeared FNs are explored.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8847117/,2019 28th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),29 July-1 Aug. 2019,ieeexplore

In order to advanced provision resources, we need to predict the mobility patterns of the consumers so that this can be done in an efficient fashion. To predict the mobility pattern of the user equipment's (UE's) one tends to fit a single ML/AI model and deploy it in the network. In real life, there can be more than one underlying pattern in the data and a single model need not be necessarily generalizable. Also, in some cases, the underlying mobility pattern may change with time which is known as concept drift. If the distribution change is beyond a threshold, it is better to retrain the model to generalize it for the new set of data and it is a costly exercise. However, in the case of multiple models, the problem is complex, and confusion arises on which model to retrain when the concept drift is detected. In this work, we propose a new method to handle concept drift in the multiple model scenario and further advise which model to retrain once the concept drift is detected. This mechanism can be used to generate accurate results without costly retraining on the model multiple times even when the underlying distribution changes rapidly. Results on simulated data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and are able to give accurate mobility predictions with minimum retrainings.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9367494/,2020 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps,7-11 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

The government performed recovery activities pursuant to their own road-recovery plan to help damaged citizens' lives return to their original condition as soon as possible. However, it took a week after the disaster to begin to restoration of neighborhood roads. Therefore, optimal decision-making systems are necessary to improve resiliency related to real life. We adopt an off-policy algorithm of a single-agent deep Q-learning approach, because disaster situations differ based on the occurrence area, and a generalized solution for optimal decision making does not exist. To develop a decision-making system that accounts for human mobility, we utilized origin-destination pairs extracted from the location data of smartphones and, digital road maps reproduced from real topologies. Agent in our model is the entrance point of the O-D pairs passing through a damaged road section on normal days. Each agent is assigned tendency to decide actions according to the road type, and a weight factor depending on the extent of damage. In addition, a restoration rate, which refers to the score of the action, is calculated based on the delayed travel time according to the changed demand of the trip. Restoration rate is affected by the agent's action, and gives the environment information related to the answer signals. This helped us to ascertain that it takes a longer time for origin-destination pairs using a road section with heavy traffic to recover to their original state. We estimated the number of required steps of each O-D's mobility until they get their own restoration rate over than 0.85.

10.1109/CCNC46108.2020.9045127,Where to Go Next?: A Realistic Evaluation of AI-Assisted Mobility Predictors for HetNets,IEEE,Conferences,"5G is considered as the ecosystem to abet the ever growing number of mobile devices and users requiring an unprecedented amount of data and highly demanding Quality of Experience (QoE). To accommodate these demands, 5G requires extreme densification of base station deployment, which will result in a network that requires overwhelming efforts to maintain and manage. User mobility prediction in wireless communications can be exploited to overcome these foregoing challenges. Knowledge of where users will go next enables cellular networks to improve handover management. In addition, it allows networks to engage in advanced resource allocation and reservation, cell load prediction and proactive energy saving. However, anticipating the movement of humans is, in itself, a challenge due to the lack of realistic mobility models and insufficiencies of cellular system models in capturing a real network dynamics. In this paper, we have evaluated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted mobility predictors. We model mobility prediction as a multi-class classification problem to predict the future base station association of the mobile users using Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Using a realistic mobility model and a 3GPP-compliant cellular network simulator, results show that, XGBoost outperforms DNN with prediction accuracy reaching up to 95% in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) scenario with shadowing varied from OdB to 4dB.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9045127/,2020 IEEE 17th Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),10-13 Jan. 2020,ieeexplore

In ZigBee networks, a tree topology is often used to construct a wireless sensor network for data delivery applications. However, delivery failures constantly occur in ZigBee wireless applications due to node movements and network topology changes. The conventional route reconstruction method is designed to mitigate the effects of topology changes, but it consumes a large amount of resources. In this paper, we exploit the regularity in node mobility patterns to reduce the frequency of route reconstructions and ensure that the transmission of data to mobile nodes is efficient. To increase the data delivery ratio and mitigate the effects of packet loss caused by the node mobility, we propose a ZigBee node deployment and tree construction framework. In particular, the framework considers the regularity in mobility patterns during the construction of the routing tree and deployment of nodes. It also includes an overhearing mechanism for mobile nodes to further improve the data delivery ratio. We present details of the proposed algorithms for node deployment and tree construction in the framework. The effectiveness of network topologies constructed under the framework is demonstrated through comprehensive ns-2 simulations based on two real-world scenarios.

Existing methods mainly focus on learning sequential mobility patterns by capturing long-short term dependencies among historical check-ins. However, users have personalized moving preferences, which have not been considered in previous work. Besides, how to leverage the prior knowledge behind human mobility needs to be further investigated. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised method, called AdattTUL, to make adversarial mobility learning for human trajectory classification, which is an end-to-end framework modeling human moving patterns. AdattTUL integrates multiple human preferences of check-in behaviors and involves an attention mechanism to dynamically capture the complex relationships of user check-ins from trajectory data.

This ensures that users' resource-intensive tasks are always served by the most suitable FNs in their vicinity. However, since MM decisionmaking requires control information which is difficult to predict accurately a-priori, such as the users' mobility patterns and the dynamics of the FNs, researchers have started to shift their attention towards MM solutions based on online learning. Motivated by this approach, in this paper, we consider a bandit learning model to address the mobility-induced FN selection problem, with a particular focus on scenarios with a high FN density. Following this approach, a software agent implemented within the user's device learns the FNs' delay performances via trial and error, by sending them the user's computation tasks and observing the perceived delay, with the goal of minimizing the accumulated delay. This task is particularly challenging when considering a high FN density, since the number of unknown FNs that need to be explored is high, while the time that can be spent on learning their performances is limited, given the user's mobility. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose to limit the number of explorations to a small subset of the FNs. As a result, the user can still have time to be served by the FN that was found to yield the lowest delay performance. Using real world mobility traces and task generation patterns, we found that it pays off to limit the number of explorations in high FN density scenarios.

It is defined to help members to select to whom interact based on collective information regarding real interactions with any user. In this way, we provide a tool intended to build trust among members of a sharing economy community given that is a major drawback from online transactions. As a workbench to run the linguistic decision making model, a web site and a mobile application for iOS and Android offer access to a carpooling service named Teranga Go! that seek to foster the mobility of international migration flows from Europe to Africa, based on concepts of collaborative economy and participatory consumption. The novelty of the site is the possibility of using hesitant linguistic expressions to assess a set of qualitative criteria and the use of the community members as the pool of experts. Unlike many multi criteria decision making problems we do not rank alternatives, we just qualify them using the retrieved opinions, which target a given user, and are collected over any interaction with this person along the time.

10.1109/SSCI.2016.7849899,A fuzzy-based machine learning model for robot prediction of link quality,IEEE,Conferences,"With foresight into the state of the wireless channel, a robot can make various optimization decisions with regards to routing packets, planning mobility paths, or switching between diverse radios. However, the process of predicting link quality (LQ) is nontrivial due to the streaming and dynamic nature of radio wave propagation, which is complicated by robot mobility. Due to robot movement, the wireless propagation environment can change considerably in terms of distance, obstacles, noise, and interference. Therefore, LQ must be learned and regularly updated while the robot is online. However, the existing fuzzy-based models for assessing LQ are non-adaptable due to the absence of any learning mechanism. To address this issue, we introduce a fuzzy-based prediction model designed for the efficient online and incremental learning of LQ. The unique approach uses fuzzy logic to infer LQ based on the collective output from a series of offset classifiers and their posterior probabilities. In essence, the proposed model leverages machine learning for extracting the underlying functional relationship between the input and output variables, but deeper inferences are made from the output of the learning algorithms using fuzzy logic. Wireless link data from a real-world robot network was used to compare the model with the traditional linear regression approach. The results show statistically significant improvements in three out of the six real-world indoor and outdoor environments where the robot operated. Additionally, the novel approach offers a number of other benefits, including the flexibility to use fuzzy logic for model tuning, as well as the ability to make implementation efficiencies in terms of parallelization and the conservation of labeling resources.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7849899/,2016 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI),6-9 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore

In this paper, we propose an adaptive deployment strategy for UAV-aided networks based on hybrid deep reinforcement learning, where a UAV can adjust its movement direction and distance to serve users who move randomly in the target area. Through hybrid deep reinforcement learning, UAVs can be trained offline to obtain the global state information and learn a completely distributed control strategy, with which each UAV only needs to take actions based on its observed state in the real deployment to be fully adaptive. Moreover, in order to improve the speed and effect of learning, we improve hybrid reinforcement learning, by adding genetic algorithms and TD-error-based resampling optimization mechanism.

Considering that cells located in different places have different predictability, in this paper, we propose an adaptive edge caching algorithm based on content popularity as well as the individual's prediction results to provide an optimal caching strategy, aiming to maximize the cache hit rate with acceptable file replacement cost. A heuristic optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms is presented, along with a prediction model based on an improved Markov model for each user according to the historical data.

This enables us to perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution.

In order to advanced provision resources, we need to predict the mobility patterns of the consumers so that this can be done in an efficient fashion. To predict the mobility pattern of the user equipment's (UE's) one tends to fit a single ML/AI model and deploy it in the network. In real life, there can be more than one underlying pattern in the data and a single model need not be necessarily generalizable. Also, in some cases, the underlying mobility pattern may change with time which is known as concept drift. If the distribution change is beyond a threshold, it is better to retrain the model to generalize it for the new set of data and it is a costly exercise. However, in the case of multiple models, the problem is complex, and confusion arises on which model to retrain when the concept drift is detected. In this work, we propose a new method to handle concept drift in the multiple model scenario and further advise which model to retrain once the concept drift is detected. This mechanism can be used to generate accurate results without costly retraining on the model multiple times even when the underlying distribution changes rapidly.

For these applications, the decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) [1]. The experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip [2]. Our best experiment achieves an accuracy on offline implementation of 86%, that drops to 83% when it is ported onto the Loihi Chip. The Neuromorphic Hardware implementation has maximum 0.72 ms of latency for every sample, and consumes only 310 mW.

The paging procedure consumes significant amount of licensed spectrum resources. The signaling overhead is going to worsen further with the increasing use of small cells and higher user mobility speed. To address this challenge, the telecommunication industry is embracing closed loop approaches to predict user mobility patterns. Though the mobility pattern prediction is a known problem, most of the existing solutions apply it for enhancing the handover management and use academic dataset. Furthermore, limited research has been done on idle-state users. In this paper, we propose a Closed Loop Paging (CLOP) optimization solution using semi-supervised learning model to reduce paging overhead. We harness the real network dataset to analyze the location trail of users in the network to predict a subset of Base Stations for paging to locate idle-state users.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent's behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders' objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains).

ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows. With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform.

In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment.

The government performed recovery activities pursuant to their own road-recovery plan to help damaged citizens' lives return to their original condition as soon as possible. However, it took a week after the disaster to begin to restoration of neighborhood roads. Therefore, optimal decision-making systems are necessary to improve resiliency related to real life. We adopt an off-policy algorithm of a single-agent deep Q-learning approach, because disaster situations differ based on the occurrence area, and a generalized solution for optimal decision making does not exist. To develop a decision-making system that accounts for human mobility, we utilized origin-destination pairs extracted from the location data of smartphones and, digital road maps reproduced from real topologies. Agent in our model is the entrance point of the O-D pairs passing through a damaged road section on normal days. Each agent is assigned tendency to decide actions according to the road type, and a weight factor depending on the extent of damage. In addition, a restoration rate, which refers to the score of the action, is calculated based on the delayed travel time according to the changed demand of the trip. Restoration rate is affected by the agent's action, and gives the environment information related to the answer signals. This helped us to ascertain that it takes a longer time for origin-destination pairs using a road section with heavy traffic to recover to their original state. We estimated the number of required steps of each O-D's mobility until they get their own restoration rate over than 0.85.

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw EMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our approach.

Service selection is a process to choose services that meet the functional and non-functional properties for each user. Some of the features of the IoT environment make this process more complicated. For example, user's mobility constantly changes the connected service collections. Because the dynamic nature of the environment leads to changes in the QoS (quality of service), judging a service that satisfies the needs of users in the future is difficult based on previous QoS static values. Moreover, an IoT service relies on its device, which is affected by CPU processing power and battery capacity. Hence, long-term and stable service cannot be provided to users. In order to solve the above problems, we need a service selection method that can consider the quality of the service and reflect the service context in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT service selection approach by using the linear reward inaction (LRI) algorithm to learn all subjective assessments from the latest user feedback and objective assessments of service.

However, MECs must cope with several challenges that do not arise in the context of conventional cloud platforms. These include the potentially highly distributed geographical deployment, heterogeneity, and limited resource capacity of Edge Data Centers (EDCs), and end-user mobility. In this paper, we present an elasticity controller to help MECs overcome these challenges by automatic proactive resource scaling. The controller utilizes information on the physical locations of EDCs and the correlation of workload changes in physically neighboring EDCs to predict request arrival rates at EDCs. These predictions are used as inputs for a queueing theory-driven performance model that estimates the number of resources that should be provisioned to EDCs in order to meet predefined Service Level Objectives (SLOs) while maximizing resource utilization. The controller also incorporates a group-level load balancer that is responsible for redirecting requests among EDCs during runtime so as to minimize the request rejection rate. We evaluate our approach by performing simulations with an emulated MEC deployed over a metropolitan area and a simulated application workload using a real-world user mobility trace. The results show that our proposed pro-active controller exhibits better scaling behavior than a state-of-the-art re-active controller and increases the efficiency of resource provisioning, thereby helping MECs to sustain resource utilization and rejection rates that satisfy predefined SLOs while maintaining system stability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9355585/,2020 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC),12-14 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

In the health domain, and especially for remote healthcare monitoring systems, the management of data in real time becomes a requirement. Indeed, care providers need to access the vital information and sometimes the processed data in order to take timely the adequate decision. However, many issues arise in the data processing regarding real-time aspect, computational complexity and patient mobility. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) engages promising technologies such as the fog and the cloud computing as well as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to address the aforementioned issues. Fog computing enables data preprocessing in proximity of medical users, exploiting patients mobile phones or personal digital assistant (PDA) or small-scale distributed servers.

As part of a real world trial in Waterford, Ireland, 150 dairy cows were each fitted with a long range pedometer. The mobility data from the sensors attached to the front leg of each cow is aggregated at the fog node to form time series of behavioral activities (e.g., step count, lying time and swaps per hour). These are analyzed in the cloud and lameness anomalies are sent to farmer's mobile device using push notifications. The application and model automatically measure and can gather data continuously such that cows can be monitored daily. This means there is no need for herding the cows, furthermore the clustering technique employed proposes a new approach of having a different model for subsets of animals with similar activity levels as opposed to a one size fits all approach. It also ensures that the custom models dynamically adjust as weather and farm condition change as the application scales.

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models. By fully leveraging the conceptual foundation of multiagent systems, our framework provides flexibility and extensibility that is difficult to achieve by existing approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework on the models of five distinct interaction-rich transport systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6728547/,16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013),6-9 Oct. 2013,ieeexplore

Providing multipath routing is beneficial to avoid traffic congestion and break in communication in MANETs where routes are disconnected frequently due to mobility. Differentiated Services (DiffServ) which have simple, efficient and scalable characteristics can be used to classify network traffic into different priority levels and apply different scheduling and queuing mechanisms to obtain QoS guarantees.

It involves various society's actors such as politicians, environmental analysts, energy providers, customers, business partners, etc. Offering analytical tools to analyze the <i>EM</i> activities represents a crucial issue for the involved actors. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of the usage of electrical vehicles. We focus on two main actors of <i>EM</i>: the French energy provider EDF and the users of electrical vehicles. EDF is in charge of providing energy power for electrical vehicles equipped with sensors. To understand the behavior of end users, our first contribution is the proposition of a data warehouse solution to store the large amount of data generated by sensors. Due to the heterogeneity of sensors sources, this data warehouse is based on a domain ontology developed in a modular way. An important aspect for EDF is the exploitation of the data warehouse by the means of business processes to obtain indicators, generate invoices, etc. Usually, these processes are defined outside the data warehouse and developed by software engineers. This solution is insufficient in our context, as EDF engineers are regularly designing, modifying and refining indicators.

Motivated by the above conflicts, this paper aims to minimize the total energy consumed by the UAV during the region detection mission through jointly optimizing the collected data size, transmission time, and flying trajectory. Toward this end, we derive the optimal data collection and transmission time in closed forms via convex optimization, and propose a model-free reinforcement learning-based algorithm for training the UAV to plan its trajectory without knowing the environment information in advance.

10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127383,Participants Selection for From-Scratch Mobile Crowdsensing via Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Participant selection is a major research challenge in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). Previous approaches commonly assume that adequately long and fixed periods of candidate participants' historical mobility trajectories are available before the selection process. This enables the frameworks to accurately model mobility which enables the optimization of selection. However, this assumption may not be realistic for newly-released MCS applications or platforms because the candidates have just boarded without previous mobility profiles. The sparsity or even absence of mobility traces will incur inaccurate location prediction of the individual participant, thus imposing negative effects on the participant selection process and hindering the practical deployment of new MCS applications. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem called ""From-Scratch MCS"" (FS-MCS for short), in which we study how to intelligently select participants to minimize such ""cold-start"" effect. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning, which we name RL-Recruiter. With the gradual accumulation of mobility trajectories over time, RL-Recruiter can make a good sequence of participant selection decisions for each sensing slot by incrementally extracting and utilizing the collective mobility patterns of all candidate participants, thus avoiding the prediction of individual participant's location that is very inaccurate when the training data is sparse. We test our approach experimentally based on two real-world mobility datasets.

10.1109/BigData.2018.8622491,Profiling Driver Behavior for Personalized Insurance Pricing and Maximal Profit,IEEE,Conferences,"Profiling driver behaviors and designing appropriate pricing models are essential for auto insurance companies to gain profits and attract customers (drivers). The existing approaches either rely on static demographic information like age, or model only coarse-grained driving behaviors. They are therefore ineffective to yield accurate risk predictions over time for appropriate pricing, resulting in profit decline or even financial loss. Moreover, existing pricing strategies seldom take profit maximization into consideration, especially under the enterprise constraints. The recent growth of vehicle telematics data (vehicle sensing data) brings new opportunities to auto insurance industry, because of its sheer size and fine-grained mobility for profiling drivers. But, how to fuse these sparse, inconsistent and heterogeneous data is still not well addressed. To tackle these problems, we propose a unified PPP (Profile-Price-Profit) framework, working on the real-world large-scale vehicle telematics data and insurance data. PPP profiles drivers' fine-grained behaviors by considering various driving features from the trajectory perspective. Then, to predict drivers' risk probabilities, PPP leverages the group-level insight and categorizes drivers' different temporal risk change patterns into groups by ensemble learning. Next, the pricing model in PPP incorporates both the demographic analysis and the mobility factors of driving risk and mileage, to generate personalized insurance price for supporting flexible premium periods. Finally, the maximal profit problem proves to be NP-Complete. Then, an efficient heuristic-based dynamic programming is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that, PPP effectively predicts the driver's risk and outperforms the current company's pricing strategy (in industry) and the state-of-the-art approach. PPP also achieves near the maximal profit (difference by only 3%) for the company, and lowers the total price for the drivers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8622491/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore

In particular, the edge caching policy with D2D sharing model based on the analysis of user mobility and social relationship is derived.

The main issues in MANETs include the mobility of the network nodes, energy limitations and bandwidth. Thus, routing protocols should explicitly consider network changes into the algorithm design.

UASs have high mobility, are easily deployed, and capable of real-time monitoring of crowd behavior by utilizing multi-sensor-based detection and remote sensing of objects. These capabilities make UASs a very useful tool for Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT) applications, such as Law Enforcement (LE), capitalizing on Human Factors (HF). This study examines the concept of leveraging drone technology together with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to produce a UAS system that can assist LE in the monitoring and assessment of crowd behaviors during peaceful and non-peaceful events. LE agencies are increasingly being tasked with engaging in dynamic environments that exist at public events. Utilized as a force multiplier and autonomous tool, would benefit from an AI-UAS platform utilizing artificial intelligence assisting in identifying behavior of peaceful people as opposed to malevolent participants or instigators that may attempt to take control. AI-UASs of this type would allow LE to leverage existing resources within their organizational structures and provide increased situation awareness via a Live Virtual Constructive (LVC) broadcast and monitoring of these dynamic environments. Information provided from these AI-UAS systems would provide real-time information to field forces as well as command and control operations that may be remotely located. AI-UAS Sensors can be dynamically allocated as needed for monitoring/documenting crowd behavior and police actions. Video recordings would provide evidence in court as well counter truth-bending recordings published by professional protestors and agenda driven main-stream media outlets. The benefits and impact of this type of LE AI-UAS platform would be profound. Traditional visible light based sensors can be greatly influenced by environmental factors preventing their ability to determine variations regarding abnormal crowd behaviors.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled.

The multi-agent system, which has special features in adaptivity, autonomy, collaborative behavior, mobility and so on, has the potential to help solve these problems in collaborative computing, shared knowledge and rules, and complex communication, negotiation and voting. In this paper, multi-agent method is used to solve reconciliation of inconsistent perspectives in a real-time collaborative 3D environment. First, an application-based ontology is created to define the system-wide status including user profiles, user behaviors, system functions and status, and data and data sources.

Currently, vehicles are supposed to carry relatively more storage, on board computing facilities, increased sensing power and communication systems. In order to cope with real world demands such as low latency, low storage cost, mobility, etc., for the deployment of VANETs, numerous attempts have been taken to integrate fog-computing with VANETs. In the recent past, Ma et al.

10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00051,Smart Energy Management System based on Reconfigurable AI Chip and Electrical Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls. The author has built a specialized laboratory to investigate machine learning technology applied to autonomous systems. In this laboratory miniature autonomous vehicles are developed. The general idea of this experimental setup allows research on new methodologies for autonomous systems in a very small scale",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9373129/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp),17-20 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore

However, it is very challenging to model and predict citywide passenger flow because there are a variety of factors potentially influencing it, such as the dynamic change of passenger flow and spatiotemporal correlations. To this end, in this paper, we first investigate multiple types of heterogeneous data that are related to the citywide passenger flow, and extract different features from each type of the data, including mobility related features, connectivity and traffic capacity, regional characteristics, event and weather, and temporal view features. Then, upon these features, we develop a spatiotemporal multi-task learning based regression approach for predicting the citywide passenger flow.

A major development is that the prosthetic restoration of a limb or an extremity re-establishes the functional mobility of the patient. Therefore, myoelectric control devices become popular as they mimic the appearance and replace the function of a missing limb simultaneously. For this reason, the overall goal of this project is to classify motion patterns, especially of different types of contractions in order to drive a below-elbow prosthetic arm. Firstly, the acquisition part is designed to capture surface EMG signals using Myoware sensor acquisition board placed on the biceps and triceps and to perform the required signal processing. Secondly, an analysis is performed on the obtained signals, and feature extraction is implemented accordingly. After that, the EMG classification is done using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computing system. The ANN is a machine learning method made of many layers, and trained to recognize the muscle contractions. The weights and the activation function are updated to predict seven gestures output.

10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, urban mobility plays an important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9202791/,"2020 IEEE 44th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",13-17 July 2020,ieeexplore

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility.

With this tool, numerous driving and highway situations can be created and fed to the agent from which it can learn. The environment opens the opportunity to randomize and customize the other road users' behavior. Thus the experience can be more diverse, and thus the representation becomes more general.

This can be implemented in the city, at which it is recognized to be developed as a smart city. The proposed research work analyzes the vehicle density using python-OpenCV and YOLOv3. Real time videos are recorded in four directions from Sony HD IP cameras in a designated area. Image frames from video sequence are used to detect moving vehicles. The background extraction method is applied for each frame which is used in subsequent analysis to detect and count all the vehicles. The blobs are detected for each vehicle which helps to track the vehicle in motion. The center of each vehicle with blob gives the count of vehicle based on the lanes considered.

This work performs the implementation of a counting system for mobility actors like cars, pedestrians, motorcycles, bicycles, buses, and trucks in the context of an Edge computing application using deep learning. However, the implementation of Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection in low-capacity embedded devices make it difficult to perform tasks that require high processing or must be carried out in real time. To solve this problem this study presents the analysis and implementation of different techniques based on the use of an additional hardware element as is the case of a Vision Processing Unit (VPU) in combination with methods that affect the resolution, bit rate, and time of video processing. For this purpose we consider the Mobilenet-SSD model with two approaches: a pre-trained model with known data sets and a trained model with images from our specific scenarios. The use of SSD-Mobilenet's model generates different results in terms of accuracy and time of video processing in the system. Results show that the use of an embedded device in combination with a VPU and video processing techniques reach 18.62 Frames per Second (FPS).

In this proposed solution we describe a vision control unit for a fully self-driving vehicle developed on Xilinx MPSoC platform using open source software components.The vision control unit of an FSD vehicle is responsible for camera video capture, image processing and rendering, AI algorithm processing, data and meta-data transfer to next stage of the FSD pipeline. In this proposed solution we have used many open source stacks and frameworks for video and AI processing. The processing of the video pipeline and algorithms take full advantage of the pipelining and parallelism using all the heterogenous cores of the Xilinx MPSoC. In addition, we have developed an extensible, scalable, adaptable and configurable AI backend framework, XTA, for acceleration purposes that is derived from a popular, open source AI backend framework, TVM-VTA. XTA uses all the MPSoC cores for its computation in a parallel and pipelined fashion. XTA also adapts to the compute and memory parameters of the system and can scale to achieve optimal performance for any given AI problem.

To accommodate these demands, 5G requires extreme densification of base station deployment, which will result in a network that requires overwhelming efforts to maintain and manage. User mobility prediction in wireless communications can be exploited to overcome these foregoing challenges. Knowledge of where users will go next enables cellular networks to improve handover management. In addition, it allows networks to engage in advanced resource allocation and reservation, cell load prediction and proactive energy saving. However, anticipating the movement of humans is, in itself, a challenge due to the lack of realistic mobility models and insufficiencies of cellular system models in capturing a real network dynamics.

The MR data is generated by mobile objects while connecting to data services and is stored in backend data centers. To geo-tag or localize such MR data is believed to have a profound effect on the analytics and optimizations of telco and traffic networks. However, MR records are of noisy and partial observations regarding to mobile objects' geo-locations and hence pose challenges to accurate telco data localization. There have been quite a few attempts. Single-point localization methods map a MR record to a location, but come out with limited accuracies due to the ignorance of spatiotemporal coherence of successive MR records. Recent efforts on sequential localization techniques alleviate this by mapping a sequence of MR records to a trajectory. However, existing solutions are often with assumptions on specific models, e.g., mobility and signal strength distributions, or priori knowledge on topology space, e.g., road networks, limiting the deployment in practice. To this end, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle the challenges in sequential telco localization. We solely use raw MR records and a public third-party GPS dataset for the learning of the correlations between mobile objects' locations and MR records, requiring no model assumptions and priori knowledge. To handle the data-intensive workloads during the learning process, we use materialized views for efficient online localization and light-weighted indexing techniques for periodical parameters tuning, in order to improve the efficiency and scalability. Results on real data show that our solution achieves 58.8 percent improvement in median localization errors compared with state-of-art sequential localization techniques that require hypothesis models and priori knowledge, making our solution superior in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and employability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8939387/,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore

This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' QoE while minimizing the transmit power used by the UAVs. To solve this problem, a novel algorithm based on the machine learning framework of conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Using ESNs, the network can effectively predict each user's content request distribution and its mobility pattern when limited information on the states of users and the network is available. Based on the predictions of the users' content request distribution and their mobility patterns, we derive the optimal locations of UAVs as well as the content to cache at UAVs. Simulation results using real pedestrian mobility patterns from BUPT and actual content transmission data from Youku show that the proposed algorithm can yield 33.3% and 59.6% gains, respectively, in terms of the average transmit power and the percentage of the users with satisfied QoE compared with a benchmark algorithm without caching and a benchmark solution without UAVs.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7875131/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,May 2017,ieeexplore

With mobile edge computing, microservices can be further deployed in edge clouds dynamically, launched quickly, and migrated across edge clouds easily, providing better services for users in proximity. However, the user mobility can result in frequent switch of nearby edge clouds, which increases the service delay when users move away from their serving edge clouds. To address this issue, this article investigates microservice coordination among edge clouds to enable seamless and real-time responses to service requests from mobile users. The objective of this work is to devise the optimal microservice coordination scheme which can reduce the overall service delay with low costs. To this end, we first propose a dynamic programming-based offline microservice coordination algorithm, that can achieve the globally optimal performance. However, the offline algorithm heavily relies on the availability of the prior information such as computation request arrivals, time-varying channel conditions and edge cloud's computation capabilities required, which is hard to be obtained. Therefore, we reformulate the microservice coordination problem using Markov decision process framework and then propose a reinforcement learning-based online microservice coordination algorithm to learn the optimal strategy. Theoretical analysis proves that the offline algorithm can find the optimal solution while the online algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, based on two real-world datasets, i.e., the Telecom's base station dataset and Taxi Track dataset from Shanghai, experiments are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed online algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of service delay and migration costs, and the achieved performance is close to the optimal performance obtained by the offline algorithm.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8924682/,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,1 March 2021,ieeexplore

To compensate for the severe loss and attenuation, beamforming training is used to determine the optimal beam direction and thereby improve directional transmission power. However, the training overhead will be significantly increased with narrower beams, particularly under conventional exhaustive schemes. Therefore, we propose a learning-based adjustable beam number training (LABNT) scheme to intelligently and flexibly select beam training candidates considering different user mobility and hybrid line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. In LABNT, several deep learning networks are parallelly constructed and connected to a reinforcement learning network to determine training candidates dynamically based on performance rewards.

Typically, UAVs are used as supplementary access points to existing ground infrastructure to extend network coverage and capacity. Therefore, finding the optimal position for each UAV is a crucial task that can be resolved by multiobjective optimization. In this paper, a self-organizing UAV swarm model is introduced as an evolutionary type of heuristic that can be adjusted in real time based on the network’s key performance indicators (KPIs). The exogenous dynamics of the wireless communication system are reflected by an end-user mobility model based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. To achieve versatility in the positioning of UAVs, a model of virtual forces is adopted to enable control of the movement of each UAV via a collection of persistent and mutable parameters of the system. Evolution is controlled by eleven strategic versions of parametric mutations, including a neutral benchmark process. The simulation results reveal that the suggested solution allows for a substantial increase in the KPI efficiency metrics relative to those of the nonmutated system. The results also addressed the presence of the Pareto front, where it is not possible to improve the selected KPIs without negatively affecting others.

Therefore, the intent of individuals should be identified and the device movement should adhere to it. Skeletal muscles contract synergistically to produce defined lower limb movements, so unique contraction patterns in lower extremity musculature may provide a means of device joint control. Ultrasound (US) imaging enables direct measurement of the local deformation of muscle segments. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower limb movements. Methods: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate US features of the rectus femoris muscle during a non-weight-bearing knee flexion/extension experiment by nine able-bodied subjects. Five US features of the skeletal muscle tissue were studied, namely thickness, angle between aponeuroses, pennation angle, fascicle length, and echogenicity. A multiscale ridge filter was utilized to extract the structures in the image and a random sample consensus (RANSAC) model was used to segment muscle aponeuroses and fascicles. A localization scheme further guided RANSAC to enable tracking in a US image sequence. Gaussian process regression models were trained using segmented features to estimate both knee joint angle and angular velocity. Results: The proposed segmentation-estimation approach could estimate knee joint angle and angular velocity with an average root mean square error value of 7.45° and 0.262 rad/s, respectively.

A specific problem that has recently spurred research interest is the so-called Social Circle Inference from Mobility data (SCIM), aiming at inferring relationships among users based on mobility data and without any explicit structured network information. The existing methods either require partial social ties or fail to model the implicit correlations between user links, thereby suffering from critical inference bias.

Instead of directly applying the recurrent model on training user trajectories, the proposed method introduces a new module for context-aware check-in representation learning by adaptively incorporating the internal states of the recurrent layers, which is more effective than the context-independent check-in embedding used in existing social circle inference approaches. To model the underlying correlations between labels, SCIMAC leverages a more sophisticated label embedding technique to adjust the penalties for correlated users, enabling a better understanding of the user's hierarchy in the label space, and alleviating the inference bias.

It allows mobile services to be shared through device-to-device links and composed by combining a set of services together to create a complex, value-added, and cross-organizational business application. Nevertheless, various challenges, especially the reliability and quality-of-service of such a MANET-based mobile service composition, are yet to be properly tackled. Most studies and related composition strategies assume that mobile users are fully stable and constantly available. However, this is not realistic in most real-world scenarios where mobile users are mobile. The mobility of mobile users impact the reliability of corresponding mobile services and consequently impact the success rate of mobile service compositions. In this paper, we propose a reliability-aware mobile service composition approach based on prediction of mobile users' positions. We model the composition problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop an evolutionary multi-objective optimization-based algorithm to solve it. Extensive case studies are performed based on a real-world mobile users' trajectory data set and show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional ones in terms of composition success rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8463452/,IEEE Access,2018,ieeexplore

According to the time-varying characteristics and the node's mobility of opportunistic networks, this paper proposes a novel link prediction method based on the Bayesian recurrent neural network (BRNN-LP) framework. The time series data of a dynamic opportunistic networks is sliced into snapshots in which there exist the correlation information and spatial location information. A vector of a snapshot is constructed based on such information, which represents the link information. Then, the vectors of multiple network snapshots constitute a spatiotemporal vector sequence. Benefiting from the BRNN's ability of extracting the features of time series data, the correlation between spatiotemporal vector sequence and node connection states is learned, and the law of the link evolution is captured to predict future links. The results on the MIT Reality dataset show that compared with methods such as the similarity-based indices, the support vector classifier, linear discriminant analysis and recurrent neural network, the proposed prediction method is more accurate and stable.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8937548/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively. When the devices' brands are split for creating a regression model, compared with two counting-based approaches, the proposed passenger estimation algorithm results in lower errors with a mean of 3.15 and a variance of 9.29.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9103621/,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,1 Oct.-Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth.

However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis.

Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time.

The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users' mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, SFC placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques.

Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain.

These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment. In this paper we propose a Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System based on the speed of vehicles, for effective lane changing in the dynamic mobility model.

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models.

Since the random delay of packet or cell switched networks makes synchronization among media more complicated after the transmission across the network, a model which considers the random transmission delay is hence required to specify the temporal relationship among media. Therefore, a real-time synchronization model is presented to satisfy this requirement in the paper. Based on the proposed synchronization model, a transport protocol, namely the multimedia synchronization transport protocol (MSTP), is designed and implemented.

In this paper, an SDN with flexible architecture is considered and a transport component is proposed. The component based on mesh topology is an example of joint route prediction and forwarding. First, different from existing transport protocols, the component can adopt a software-defined stream access control strategy that includes an extended forwarding mechanism (retransmission) to improve the short-term response performance. Second, we evaluate the impact of route prediction on transport network performance by using offline training and prediction. The key challenge here is that a suitable model needs to be trained from a limited training sample dataset, which will dynamically update the forwarding rules based on current and historical facts (network data).

This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands.

The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the “last mile” scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene. Note to Practitioners-This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene, and it is also applicable to other scenes, including commuting scenes, urban transportation hub scenes, and destination scenes of the tourist market. Shared bus operation routes at such scenes are usually aimed at trips with fixed destinations. Existing approaches to planning routes are generally designed for traditional transportation, such as traditional buses and taxis. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic route planning approach (SubBus) based on the operation characteristics of shared subway shuttle buses. We perform a resident travel behavior analysis to improve the accuracy of travel requirement prediction. After that, we combine the prediction results and station properties to gain shared bus optimal routes. We then display how to apply SubBus to optimize shared bus operation status based on crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data generated by Panda Bus Company.

However, this technology has proven to be susceptible to electromagnetic interferences and also the economic feasibility is questionable. This paper proposes a model that employs real time image processing and object detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called SSD Mobilenet. Unlike a few other architectures, SSD Mobilenet requires very limited computation, hence enabling swift detection. Furthermore, an acoustic signal (sound) processing (pitch detection) algorithm is employed to detect the sirens of emergency vehicles to nullify the potential false positives (e.g. an ambulance in a non-emergency scenario) that creep into object detection using image processing. Both algorithms work in unison, bolstering the accuracy of detection. Upon detection, the signal instantly switches to green, facilitating the expedited movement of emergency vehicles, even in high traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9074933/,2020 2nd International Conference on Innovative Mechanisms for Industry Applications (ICIMIA),5-7 March 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICICRS46726.2019.9555893,A Novel Approach Towards Industrial Waste Management Using Q-Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Industrial waste refers to the unwanted solid, liquid and gaseous wastes resulting from an industrial operation. And the collection, transport, processing, disposal and monitoring of these wastes is called as Industrial Waste Management. Industrial Waste has adhered to severe pollution to air, water and soil in the recent years affecting environment and human health. So, its proper and effective management has become important also as the industries’ liability towards the environment. Since many industries don’t have in-house processing plants, they tie-up with industries for the task. This paper focuses on using Q-learning for effective path-planning from generator industries(waste generating) to aggregator industries(waste processing). Q-learning is used for predicting the most efficient path by learning from its own experiences of rewards and penalties and so we don’t need to train the model which therefore increases the efficiency. This work can be implemented at a place where industrial waste is generated and can be very helpful in managing the same. This could be implemented as a service and handed over to the probable customers or government organizations which provide waste management services to the industries. This submission is a step towards automation of the Industrial Waste Management and helps in planning of waste management in real-time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9555893/,2019 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Remote Sensing (ICICRS),19-20 July 2019,ieeexplore

While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI).

10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441582,A Real-Time Deep Transfer Learning Model for Facial Mask Detection,IEEE,Conferences,"With the rise of COVID-19, wearing masks in public areas has become paramount to preventing the transmission of the coronavirus, Furthermore, many public service providers may require customers to properly wear masks in order to be served. But current enforcement measures of mask mandates are mostly monitored by humans, and thus may be hard to execute effectively in densely populated and fast-moving venues like airports and public transit. An automated mask detection monitoring system could greatly reduce the required human labor. In this study, a facial mask detection software model, usable in existing surveillance applications such as airport monitoring systems, is developed using Keras, a high-level deep learning API, and TensorFlow, an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The model uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which were trained from a database of roughly 12,000 images of faces, with roughly a 50-50 split of masked and unmasked, with the goal of achieving binary classification to detect whether a person is wearing a mask. The DCNN mask detection software achieved a validation accuracy of 98 percent. We also used computer vision techniques from OpenCV including facial detection and contours to detect the location of the people's faces. The DCNN was then paired with this application to achieve live feed object detection by first detecting a person, and then determine whether they are wearing a mask. Finally, we explore the potential implementation and applications of the facial detection model via the linkage of cameras in monitoring areas to signal and notify officials.As more countries are developing mask wearing regulations, automated masked face detection is a key real-world application [3]. Transportation systems are one area that have been considerably affected by the pandemic, as cities around the world had to enforce massive restrictions on public transport in order to limit transmission of the virus and ensure the safe passage of key workers during the emergency response [4]. Masks have since been required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, transportation hubs such as airports and stations [5].However, Machine Learning and Deep Learning can help to combat Covid-19 in many ways. Enabling researchers and clinicians to evaluate a vast amount of data to make various predictions. In particular, face mask detection may prove to be useful as a guide for government surveillance on people in public areas susceptible to transmission, to ensure that face mask regulations are upheld. To achieve this, deep learning binary classification facial mask model based on VGG19 and one-shot object detection methods will be trained.We contribute a dual face-and-mask detection system that can provide immediate feedback in live surveillance systems. The method introduced is fast and accurate and can work for live mask-checking in busy public areas, alleviating some of the human effort and error typically subject to the mask mandating task.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9441582/,2021 Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS),19-23 April 2021,ieeexplore

The fluctuating market necessities, the distribution of production facilities, the influence of the emerging economies and the environmental compromise force transport logistics services to be as dynamic as possible, answering to real-time events while improving their reliability, efficiency and accuracy. But the transport logistics chain is made up of actors using their own information systems (IS) for the daily management. Although several standards from the logistics world are used for message exchange, there is still a need of agreement on using the same language while preserving the internal way of operation at each company. The solution to this need opens a new horizon in providing access to information in a common language (taking advantage of existing standards). This common language would allow deploying real-time cooperative planning algorithms to find the best route attending to criteria such as the most green, quick, economic and/or safe route as well as algorithms able to react to real-time events (e.g. delays, accidents, breakdowns). In this paper, it is explained how a common language, the Common Framework for ICT (CF) in transport and logistics, was developed; how this language is implemented by ontology means and the development of ontology-based ICT tools. Tools allowing the creation of an environment where transport logistics chain's actors remain using their own IS while they are real-time situational-aware; and,additionally, proving a low entry-cost interoperability solution thanks to the avoidance of a costly shared and centralized ICT infrastructure usage.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7136595/,2015 4th International Conference on Advanced Logistics and Transport (ICALT),20-22 May 2015,ieeexplore

To address the latter issue, we consider MapReduce to design the back-end Cloud, where intelligent learning and classification algorithms are implemented to detect the stops and transportation modes and provide smartphones with an appropriate GPS sleeping interval based on the GPS statistics on the back-end Cloud. The unique feature of our system is to integrate participatory sensing and Cloud-enabled processing system closely which incorporates knowledge extracted from the Cloud (i.e., transportation modes) into sensing control of smartphones. In this way, sensing control could be optimized through the knowledge behind crowdsourced data.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes. To overcome these challenges, we propose ARIS: a system for real-time traffic accident prediction built on a traffic accident dataset named ‘US-Accidents’ which covers 49 states of United States, collected from February 2016 to June 2020. Our approach is based on a deep neural network model that utilizes a variety of data characteristics, such as time-sensitive weather data, textual information, and discerning factors. We have tested ARIS against multiple baselines through a comprehensive series of experiments across several major cities of USA, and we have noticed significant improvement during inference especially in detecting accident classes. Additionally, to make our model edge-implementable we have compressed our model using a joint technique of magnitude-based weight pruning and model quantization. We have also demonstrated the inference results along with power consumption profiling after deploying the model on a resource constrained environment that consists of Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) with Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4).

The developed system directly connects the information flow and the material flow as well as their interdependencies in order to optimize the planning and control in groupage traffic. The software system maps current processes to agents as system components and improves the efficiency by intelligent objects. To handle the high complexity and dynamics of logistics autonomous intelligent agents plan and control the way of represented objects through the logistic network by themselves and induce a flexible and reactive system behavior. We evaluate the implemented dispatching application by simulating the groupage traffic processes using effectively transported orders and process data provided by our industrial partner. Moreover, we modeled real world infrastructures and considered also the dynamics by the simulation of unexpected events and process disturbances. The results show that the system significantly decreases daily cost by reducing the required number of transport providers and shifting conventional orders to next days, which need no immediate delivery.

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network.

Dense packing of containers can significantly decrease supply chain costs, since transport fees are related to the the number of used containers and not the content. This practical problem is generally modeled using the vector bin packing problem (VBPP) and its variations. In the recent years, the heterogeneous VBPP with two sets of constraints has proven to be a good representation of container packing related problems. In this work we extend this model to a more realistic setting, by allowing multiple containers of the same type. To solve this problem, an integer program is designed. To be able to find feasible solutions for large scale problem instances, a greedy constructive algorithm is developed. With the intention of improving the solutions generated in this way, a local search is developed and used to extend the greedy algorithm to the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic. To evaluate the potential of using GRASP on this problem, several variations are designed and implemented. In our computational experiments, we have generated test instances based on real-world data. Experimental results show that the designed metaheuristic approaches provide high quality solutions compared to solutions obtained by the CPLEX solver. Further, one of the proposed GRASP variants has been adapted for the homogeneous VBPP and tested on standard benchmark instances in order to evaluate its performance against existing metaheuristic.

To tackle this problem, we propose an alternative approach in this paper.

The low-dimensional model represents the large network in terms of a small subset of road segments. The future state of the low-dimensional network is predicted by standard procedures, i.e., support vector regression.

Moreover, the space of potential environments and tasks for such systems is enormous. Therefore, methods that are able to explore this space in a structured way are needed. One way to address these issues is through model-based testing. In this paper we present an approach for testing the navigation system of a fleet of industrial transport robots. We show how all potential environments and navigation behaviors as well as requirements and restrictions can be represented in a formal constraint-based model. Moreover, we present the concept of coverage criteria in order to handle the potentially infinite space of test cases. Finally, we show how test cases can be derived from this model in an efficient way. In order to show the feasibility of the proposed approach we present an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation using a real industrial use case.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8718216/,2019 IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest),4-9 April 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/IROS.2018.8593374,Cost of Transport Estimation for Legged Robot Based on Terrain Features Inference from Aerial Scan,IEEE,Conferences,"The effectiveness of the robot locomotion can be measured using the cost of transport (CoT) which represents the amount of energy that is needed for traversing from one place to another. Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain. A thorough analysis of different terrain descriptors within the context of incremental learning is presented to select the best performing approach. We report on the achieved results and experimental verification of the selected approaches with a real hexapod robot crawling over six different terrains.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8593374/,2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),1-5 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore
10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746594,Crossfire Attack Detection Using Deep Learning in Software Defined ITS Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent developments in intelligent transport systems (ITS) based on smart mobility significantly improves safety and security over roads and highways. ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows. With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform. The results show that our approach achieves a detection accuracy of at least 80%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8746594/,2019 IEEE 89th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2019-Spring),28 April-1 May 2019,ieeexplore

Since the simulation- based prototypes are available for virtual commissioning (VC) anyway, they can be used simultaneously as reinforcement learning environments. In this work, the event-discrete flow logic for the transport and assembly of a target workpiece is learned automatically by reinforcement learning on the real use case of the VC simulation of a PLC-based production system. According to the idea of curriculum learning, the system is trained separately in subsystems to support its modularity and to reduce the complexity of the overall learning process. With regard to the learning processes, subsystems, sequence errors, termination criteria and necessary action and state adjustments typical for the PLC-based plant are identified and implemented in the VC simulation.

The CPS framework is anchored on intelligent physical worlds (IPW) around which complex adaptation behaviors are built. An IPW is an embodiment of control software functions wrapped around the raw physical processes (such as routers, links, hosts, and protocols), performing the core communication activities while adapting its behavior to the changing network conditions and user inputs. The IPW exhibits an intelligent behavior over a limited operating region of the network system, which is in contrast with the traditional models where the physical world is basically dumb. To perform over a wider range of network operating conditions, the IPW interacts with an intelligent computational world (ICW) to patch itself with suitable control parameters and rules &amp; procedures relevant in those changed conditions. The modular decomposition of a network application into IPW and ICW lowers the design complexity of network systems, and simplifies the system verification/testing.

10.1109/WAINA.2016.80,DASITS: Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System,IEEE,Conferences,"The growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, lead to increase in the number of road traffic accidents. These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment. In this paper we propose a Driver Assistance System in Intelligent Transport System based on the speed of vehicles, for effective lane changing in the dynamic mobility model. In our approach we present the lane changing based system on speed and minimum gap between the vehicles. The paper focuses towards the development of an Intelligent Transportation System that provides timely, reliable information to the drivers and the concerned authorities.

The designed system was tested on a Four Lane road at Neemrana in India.

10.1109/ICSME.2018.00014,DRLgencert: Deep Learning-Based Automated Testing of Certificate Verification in SSL/TLS Implementations,IEEE,Conferences,"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are the foundation of network security. The certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations is vital and may become the ""weak link"" in the whole network ecosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of certificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive certificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing. Although the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the cost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose DRLGENCERT, the first framework of applying deep reinforcement learning to the automated testing of certificate verification in SSL/TLS implementations. DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary certificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could trigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement learning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best next action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of simple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new techniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method for X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth. Also, we implemented a prototype of DRLGENCERT and carried out a series of real-world experiments. The results show DRLGENCERT is quite efficient, and we obtained 84,661 discrepancy-triggering certificates from 181,900 certificate seeds, say around 46.5% effectiveness. Also, we evaluated six popular SSL/TLS implementations, including GnuTLS, MatrixSSL, MbedTLS, NSS, OpenSSL, and wolfSSL.

Therefore, a real-time approach able to recognize and classify the defect starting from the finite element simulated ultrasonic echoes could be very useful in industrial applications. The ill-posedness of the so defined process induces a regularization method. In this paper, a finite element and a heuristic approach are proposed.

Using public transport, although is cheaper and efficient, entails that only fixed places of boarding/exiting may be used which, in turn, implies walking to (from) a particular location from (to) a given station. Given the impact of the weather on the mood and activities, preferences for a certain type of services may need to be dynamically adjusted based on the current weather or the near-future forecast, modulo travel-routes to preferred locations.

10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148208,Inferring Quality of Experience for Adaptive Video Streaming over HTTPS and QUIC,IEEE,Conferences,"Nowadays, Internet traffic encryption is rapidly increasing due to privacy and security concerns. This is because of the massive usage of end-to-end security protocols over Internet such as HTTPS and QUIC. The encryption trend will continue to rapidly increase in the future, and this trend concerns video streaming applications as well. Network providers face a serious challenge in managing their networks due to such widespread deployment of end-to-end security protocols. These operators need to have a clear visibility into traffic on their networks to monitor and manage both quality of experience (QoE)-and-service (QoS) impairments in popular video streaming services, in the most effective and efficient manner. Moreover, so many factors that influence QoE need to be taken care of to get an acceptable user experience. Most of the existing solutions use the deep packet inspection to infer these factors from the encrypted traffic. However, these solutions are inefficient, most of the time, leading to low QoE inference accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine-learning based solution that leverages a random forest classifier for a better QoE inference accuracy. The proposed solution uses network-and-transport layer information to infer QoE factors such as startup delay and stall events. It helps the network providers to react quickly and in real time for any impairments in the QoE of the encrypted video traffic. We evaluate our solution using an HTTP adaptive streaming service (YouTube) that uses HTTPS and QUIC protocols. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves up to 91.1% classification accuracy for HTTPS and up to 87.3% for QUIC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9148208/,2020 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC),15-19 June 2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/NEUREL.2014.7011506,Integration of signal prediction service in Service Oriented Architecture,IEEE,Conferences,"Smart transducers based on the IEEE 1451 standard provide platform for development of distributed measurement and control systems. Integration of IEEE 1451 services based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) enables simple implementation, interoperability, scalability of distributed system components, accessible in the form of network services. Addressing the transport latency and packet loss in distributed systems, we propose the concept of algorithms' and processes' implementation in the form of dislocated network services. Introducing the signal data paths, time-stamped data and time synchronization mechanism, we provide the support for real-time system characteristics. Each component on the data path is able to analyze the packets of time-stamped information, extract an adequate sample set, and apply this set to the input of the implemented real-time algorithm or actuator. Proper management of the time-stamped information along data path enables real-time actions despite the network propagation delay or other systems' latencies. In this paper, the presented architecture is used for integration of the signal prediction service in smart transducers network based on SOA. Purpose of the service is to predict the values of arbitrary signals in order to compensate network delay and packet loss. Two realizations of the signal prediction service, based on neural networks are given: feed-forward and feedback predictive network. The system containing embedded IEEE 1451 smart transducer module for relative humidity measurement and signal prediction service on the general purpose platform is used for the experimental verification of the proposed concept.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7011506/,12th Symposium on Neural Network Applications in Electrical Engineering (NEUREL),25-27 Nov. 2014,ieeexplore

Data collection and implementation of such systems is often costly, and few countries have support for such systems in their transportation budgets. In places where maintaining currency and accuracy of information is difficult, many problems arise. For instance, in Chennai, India, real time bus transit data is not maintained, there is no proper communication about the bus schedules, bus stops are not regularly updated and inconsistent information about bus stops is observed in the transport authority's website. We are interested in developing models for identifying bus stops from trajectories for situations where accurate and current information is not available and traffic conditions are challenging, such as Chennai, India. We develop a simple yet easily accessible Android mobile application (App) to collect GPS traces of bus routes. We use our App to collect GPS trajectory data from Baltimore, Maryland, a place where there are facilities to access up-to-date information about bus stops. We also collect GPS trajectories from Chennai, India. We then develop a model using machine learning techniques to identify bus stops from the collected trajectories. We experimentally evaluate our model by training it on the Baltimore dataset and testing it on the Chennai dataset, achieving testing accuracy between 85 -- 90%. This is comparable to the accuracy of 95% achieved by both training and testing on the Chennai dataset.

In this work we have designed and implemented a system whose main purpose is to assist in the process of implementing this approach, a machine learning technique known as Active Learning was used. This technique was chosen in the context of this work, due to its potential to induce predictive models from databases with the lowest number of labels. Thus, a particle swarm algorithm PSO was used on the database, which consists of a supervised learning algorithm to validate the results obtained, a second predictive model was induced, which did not use active learning for sample selection.

Many intelligent decisions can benefit from the discovery of the most central nodes, including the planning of airline hub, transport hub and regional logistics hub. Closeness centrality is a widely used node centrality metric measuring how central a node is. However, the exact calculation of closeness centrality is not feasible for large networks due to its high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new approach for fast estimation of closeness rank without calculating the closeness centrality of all nodes in a given network. A small number of nodes are used as training samples and several low-complexity metrics are used as input features. We apply a neural network-based learning to rank method to train the model.

Novel ICT-powered responsive mobility services, such as real-time on-demand transport, are interaction-rich in a sense that they rely on frequent, ad hoc interactions between various entities of the transport system. These interactions have to be properly captured in the model if it is to accurately represent the dynamics of the modelled transport system. Unfortunately, existing modelling tools are not well suited for modelling interaction-rich transport systems. We have therefore developed a novel modular simulation framework designed specifically for modelling transport systems in which ad hoc interactions and decision making play an important role. The framework provides an extensible library of modelling elements based on a unifying ontology of agent-based modelling abstractions, a high-performance discrete-event simulation engine and suite of tools supporting real-world deployment and utilization of implemented models.

How is this possible? And how can we replicate this? A crucial clue comes from neuroscience: the brain is a complex physical system and the network topology of its neural circuitry is a determinant of its emergent collective properties. Indeed, as the brain's neural network is already entrained in its physical hardware, it clearly does not require an ANN software add-on to learn from natural data. Self-assembled nanowire networks with memristive junctions represent arguably the closest hardware architecture to real biological neural networks and are thus uniquely placed to demonstrate genuinely neuromorphic information processing. Here, we present preliminary results on polymer-coated silver nanowire networks. Their neuromorphic architecture (densely structured network topology, memristive switch junctions and efficient interconnect) gives rise to a rich repertoire of collective nonlinear dynamics manifested through adaptive current transport pathways. The potential for associative learning is demonstrated in a test protocol in which a nanowire network is stimulated by multiple electrodes mapped to different spatial patterns. The capacity to process information in the temporal domain is demonstrated via simulations of a reservoir computing implementation in which nanowire networks are shown to perform tasks such as time series prediction and handwritten digit recognition.

For their successful deployment, the content providers are increasingly becoming interested in evaluating the performance of such traffic from the final users' perspective, that is, their Quality of Experience (QoE). For this purpose, subjective quality assessment methods are costly and can not be used in real time. Therefore, automatic estimation of QoE is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a no-reference QoE monitoring module for adaptive HTTP streaming using TCP and the H.264 video codec. HTTP streaming using TCP is the popular choice of many web based and IPTV applications due to the intrinsic advantages of the protocol. Moreover, these applications do not suffer from video data loss due to the reliable nature of the transport layer. However, there can be playout interruptions and if adaptive bitrate video streaming is used then the quality of video can vary due to lossy compression. Our QoE estimation module, based on Random Neural Networks, models the impact of both factors. The results presented in this paper show that our model accurately captures the relation between them and QoE.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6181070/,2012 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC),14-17 Jan. 2012,ieeexplore

Flights recurrently deviate from their scheduled time of arrival, which has negative downstream consequences that affect the efficiency of operations. Therefore, accurate and up-to-date ETA estimations prior to its landing can help in optimizing the actions to be taken by the different air transportation agents whenever schedule deviations are incurred, and thus reduce the economic, logistic and environmental impact that they cause. This presentation exposes an infrastructure for high-fidelity computation of accurate ETA in real-time, based on a data-driven approach that leverages the use of recorded aircraft trajectories. This infrastructure is composed of different elements: (1) a live ADS-B tracks gathering system embedded in a lambda-architecture cluster, with capabilities for real-time distribution and data lake storage (2) an ETA prediction machine learning model, employing the actual 4D aircraft position as input; and (3) a hybrid cloud architecture to support real-time visualization and distributions of ETA predictions. The proposed infrastructure has been successfully validated in a real environment (Transforming Transport, an European Commission funded project). This infrastructure enables real-time computation and distribution of accurate ETA for any arrival operation of interest.

Thereby the identification and classification of traffic play an important role for increasing the performance in network management. Primitive applications were using well-known ports in transport layer, so their traffic classification can be performed based on the port number. However, the recent applications progressively use unpredictable port numbers. Consequently the later methods are based on “deep packet inspection”. Notwithstanding proper accuracy, these methods impose heavy operational load and are vulnerable to encrypted flows. The recent methods classify the traffic based on statistical packet characteristics. However, having access to a little part of statistical flow information in real-time traffic may jeopardize the performance of these methods. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two later methods, in this paper we propose an approach based on payload content and statistical traffic characteristics with Naive Bayes algorithm for real-time network traffic classification.

This makes the road traffic environment more and more complicated, and people expect to have an intelligent Vision-assisted applications that provide drivers with traffic sign information, regulate driver operations, or assist in vehicle control to ensure road safety. As one of the more important functions, traffic sign detection and recognition[1], has become a hot research direction of researchers at home and abroad. It is mainly the use of vehicle cameras to capture real-time road images, and then to detect and identify the traffic signs encountered on the road, thus providing accurate information to the driving system. However, the road conditions in the actual scene are very complicated. After many years of hard work, researchers have not yet made the recognition system practical, and further research and improvement are still needed. Traditionally, traffic signage has been detected and categorized using standard computer vision methods, but it also takes considerable time to manually process important features of the image. With the development and progress of science and technology, more and more scholars use deep learning technology to solve this problem. The main reason that the deep learning method is widely accepted is that the model can learn the deep features inside the image autonomously from the training samples, especially for many cases that do not know how to design the feature extractor, such as expression recognition, target detection Wait. Based on the application of road traffic sign detection and recognition, this article focuses on the correctness and high efficiency of detection and recognition. Through Caffe[2] which is the open-source framework, a deep convolution neural network algorithm is proposed to train traffic sign training sets to get a model that can classify traffic signs and to learn and identify the most critical of these traffic signs Features, so as to achieve the purpose of identifying traffic signs in the real scene.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8410256/,2018 International Conference on Robots & Intelligent System (ICRIS),26-27 May 2018,ieeexplore

10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00051,Smart Energy Management System based on Reconfigurable AI Chip and Electrical Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Almost every larger city in Europe has ambitious smart city projects. This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

Even though traffic flow information is better than no traffic information, drivers still face dangerous congested traffic flow. Several approaches have addressed short-term traffic information in which a stigmergy-based approach is employed as an indirect communication method for cooperation among distributed agents and for managing traffic congestion. Recently, advances in Intelligent Transport Systems suggest a future in which vehicles handle their own positions. Our foresight-route-providing method combines a previous method that utilized the past travel times of vehicles for decentralized traffic congestion management. We assume that all vehicles collect dynamic traffic conditions in decentralized processing environments as real implementation environments during the simulations. In our simulations, we demonstrate that our assignment route strategies have the potential for significant efficiency and stability for traffic flow in decentralized processing environments that can collect dynamic traffic conditions from the previous few minutes and estimate the vehicle positions after a few minutes in only limited links. In this paper, we evaluate the differences between centralized and decentralized processing environments and investigate how the ratio of probe vehicles that are equipped with such devices as navigation systems is related to efficient and stable traffic flow. We confirmed that a route assignment strategy contributes to the stable efficiency of the total travel time.

Traditional methods like ICP tend to fail without good initialization, insufficient overlap or in the presence of dynamic objects. Modern deep learning based registration approaches present much better results, but suffer from a heavy runtime.

The network output is used as the cost for an optimal transport problem whose solution yields the final matching probabilities. The system does not rely on hand crafted feature descriptors or heuristic matching strategies.

10.1109/EIT51626.2021.9491894,Teaching Vehicles to Steer Themselves with Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,Traditional approaches for steering a vehicle using machine vision require large amounts of robust hand-crafted software which is both time consuming and expensive. The presented method uses a deep neural network to teach cars to steer themselves without any additional software. We created a labeled dataset for the ACTor (Autonomous Campus TranspORt) electric vehicle by pairing real world images taken during a drive with the associated steering wheel angle. We trained a model end to end using modern deep learning techniques including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to automatically detect relevant features in the input and provide a predicted output. This means that no traditional hand engineered algorithm features were required for this implementation. We currently use an pretrained inception network on the ImageNet dataset to leverage the high level features learned from ImageNet to the steering problem through transfer learning. We removed the top portion of the network and replaced it with a linear regression node to provide the output. The model is trained end to end using backpropagation. The trained model is integrated with vehicle software on ROS (Robot Operating System) to read image data and provide a corresponding steering angle in real time. The current model achieves 15.2 degree error on average. As development continues the model may replace the current lane centering software and will be used for IGVC Self-Drive competition and campus transportation.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9491894/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT),14-15 May 2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICDAR.2017.144,Text Detection in Traffic Informatory Signs Using Synthetic Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic informatory signs, which is a category of traffic signs and text-based signs, is very important to both drivers and intelligent transport systems. Previous studies have usually sought to extract text lines in signs to apply to optical character recognition (OCR) system, but they do not work well in real-world conditions with severe disturbance. In this paper, we report on our study of place name text detection and recognition on traffic informatory signs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transform traditional text detection and recognition into word-level multi-class robust image classification. In our study, each place name corresponds to one class. Because the number of word classes is large and collecting real images for training dataset is difficult, we generate several synthetic datasets mainly by means of two methods and use them to train the CNN respectively. One method generates with standard templates of the signs, while the other method renders text in natural images which have no relationship with the signs. Our experimental results show that our method can achieve high levels of accuracy when reading traffic informatory signs in real-world conditions. Accuracy of 0.891 and 0.981 are achieved in the former and latter method of generating dataset, which verify that proposed methods are effective in our task. We also analyze the dependence of color channels in text detection during our task, which help generate the more efficacious synthetic dataset.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8270075/,2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR),9-15 Nov. 2017,ieeexplore

Public infrastructures such as tunnels and metro stations are paradigms, where travellers are frequently jammed at the exits, even under normal evacuation. Existing safety systems fail to guide effectively the most vulnerable travellers and to take into consideration the mobility impairment of each individual. In this context, current work, within SAVE ME project, proposes a robust evacuation mechanism from disaster areas in public transport terminals and infrastructures, which is incorporated in our Decision Support System (DSS). The DSS provides group-wised and personalized optimal routes to the exits, taking into consideration the personal preferences and capabilities of the travellers, along with guidelines to the rescue teams, given that rescuers must be sent to prioritized targets with trapped travellers. Furthermore, an innovative contribution of this work is the service personalization platform that was implemented in order to ensure the personalized communication of each traveller with the DSS. Service personalization is based on an intelligent agent framework. The paper provides a thorough analysis of existing evacuation models and mechanisms, presents the DSS architecture, its embedded algorithms, and the service personalization platform.

To release humans from the repetitive and laborious job, we develop an autonomous trolley deployment robot to detect, transport and collect the scattered idle trolleys to recycling points. This paper will firstly illustrate the entire collection pipeline of the deployment robot system and then address the key challenge: partial to full point set registration. With the perception framework, the robot can detect the idle trolleys and acquire the pose of the trolleys on the ground, and then capture the trolley from behind, along the same direction for subsequent grasping and manipulation. With RGB-D camera and a segmentation Convolutional Neural Network, the robot can generate a partial surface point cloud of the detected trolley. The resulting point cloud, data and a pre-scanned full trolley point cloud, model, are matched by an implicit pose. To tackle the low accuracy and long computation time issues, a novel searching space-constrained point set registration algorithm is proposed to register the two overlapping point sets. Based on Branch-and-Bound (BnB) mechanism, the error between data and model is iteratively optimized. The constraint of searching space speeds up the global searching of the optimal pose, by pruning the candidate spaces which is impossible to contain the optimal result. To evaluate the performance, an airport trolley segmentation dataset and a point cloud dataset for registration are constructed. Experimental results on the datasets and synthetic dataset show that our method achieves higher accuracy and success rate than the previous methods.

First, our tool collects for each call-site of a mathematical function the input- and output-data profile. Then, using a heuristic exploration algorithm, we estimate the minimal required accuracy by rounding the result to lower precisions. The data profile and accuracy measurement per call-site is used to speculatively select the mathematical function implementation with the most appropriate accuracy for a given scenario.

On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated.

Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced. Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools, such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described.

High-precision, stability, convergence, and lowest-possible memory requirements are ensured by the CNN processor architecture. A significant challenge solved in this paper is that all these cited computing features are ensured in all system-states (regular or chaotic ones) and in all bifurcation conditions that may be experienced by NDEs.One particular quintessence of this paper is to develop and demonstrate a solver concept that shows and ensures that CNN processors (realized either in hardware or in software) are universal solvers of NDE models. The solving logic or algorithm of given NDEs (possible examples are: Duffing, Mathieu, Van der Pol, Jerk, Chua, Rössler, Lorenz, Burgers, and the transport equations) through a CNN processor system is provided by a set of templates that are computed by our comprehensive templates calculation technique that we call nonlinear adaptive optimization. This paper is therefore a significant contribution and represents a cutting-edge real-time computational engineering approach, especially while considering the various scientific and engineering applications of this ultrafast, energy-and-memory-efficient, and high-precise NDE solver concept. For illustration purposes, three NDE models are demonstratively solved, and related CNN templates are derived and used: the periodically excited Duffing equation, the Mathieu equation, and the transport equation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6827254/,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,April 2015,ieeexplore

While many technologically smart camera solutions in the market can be integrated into Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) for automated detection, monitoring and data generation, many Network Operations (a.k.a Traffic Control) Centres still use legacy camera systems as manual surveillance devices. In this paper, we demonstrate effective use of these older assets by applying computer vision techniques to extract traffic data from videos captured by legacy cameras. In our proposed vision-based pipeline, we adopt recent state-of-the-art object detectors and transfer-learning to detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists from monocular videos. By weakly calibrating the camera, we demonstrate a novel application of the image-to-world homography which gives our monocular vision system the efficacy of counting vehicles by lane and estimating vehicle length and speed in real-world units. Our pipeline also includes a module which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with projective geometry information to classify vehicles. We have tested it on videos captured at several sites with different traffic flow conditions and compared the results with the data collected by piezoelectric sensors.

10.1109/49.481706,A multimedia synchronization model and its implementation in transport protocols,IEEE,Journals,"An implementation of a synchronization mechanism in transport protocol to support multimedia applications over a packet or cell switched network is proposed. In designing such a mechanism for practical use, ease of implementation and capability of handling random delay of packets are two key issues for success. Since the random delay of packet or cell switched networks makes synchronization among media more complicated after the transmission across the network, a model which considers the random transmission delay is hence required to specify the temporal relationship among media. Therefore, a real-time synchronization model is presented to satisfy this requirement in the paper. Based on the proposed synchronization model, a transport protocol, namely the multimedia synchronization transport protocol (MSTP), is designed and implemented. We have implemented a prototype system using the MSTP protocol and built a simulation system for the wide area network (WAN) environment in order to evaluate the performance of the MSTP protocol.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/481706/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,Jan. 1996,ieeexplore
10.1109/49.310965,A novel neural network traffic enforcement mechanism for ATM networks,IEEE,Journals,"ATM has been recommended by the CCITT as the transport vehicle for the future B-ISDN networks. In ATM-based networks, a set of user declared parameters that describes the traffic characteristics, is required for the connection acceptance control (CAC) and traffic enforcement (policing) mechanisms. At the call set-up phase, the CAC algorithm uses those parameters to make a call acceptance decision. During the call progress, the policing mechanism uses the same parameters to control the user's traffic within its declared values in order to protect the network's resources and avoid possible congestion problems. A novel policing mechanism using neural networks (NNs) is presented. This is based upon an accurate estimation of the probability density function (pdf) of the traffic via its count process and implemented using NNs. The pdf-based policing is made possible only by NNs because pdf policing requires complex calculations, in real-time, at very high speeds. The architecture of the policing mechanism is composed of two interconnected NNs. The first one is trained to learn the pdf of ""ideal nonviolating"" traffic, whereas the second is trained to capture the ""actual"" characteristics of the ""actual"" offered traffic during the progress of the call. The output of both NNs is compared. Consequently, an error signal is generated whenever the pdf of the offered traffic violates its ""ideal"" one. The error signal is then used to shape the traffic back to its original values.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/310965/,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,Aug. 1994,ieeexplore

Perhaps because these companies would like to improve this situation, or perhaps because they simply would like to reduce the petrol they consume, they are more than ever deploying plans in order to increase the efficiency of their fleets.

Nevertheless, traditional learning approaches were only successful in the short term, according to the previous work. In order to achieve long-term results, new learning paradigms must be taken into account. Furthermore, if we combine these paradigms with a learning analytics system, optimal results may be reached for both the company and the drivers.

Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking. Then, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking counter for vehicles that combines the vehicle detection and vehicle tracking algorithms to realize the detection of traffic flow. Finally, the vehicle detection network and multiple-object tracking network are migrated and deployed on the edge device Jetson TX2 platform, and we verify the correctness and efficiency of our framework.

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area.

These networks can support new use cases such as Vehicle to Vehicle and augmented reality due to its novel features such as network slicing along with the mmWave multi-gigabit-per-second data rate. Nevertheless, 5G cellular networks suffer from some shortcomings, especially in high frequencies because of the intermittent nature of channels when the frequency rises. Non-line of sight state, is one of the significant issues that the new generation encounters. This drawback is because of the intense susceptibility of higher frequencies to blockage caused by obstacles and misalignment. This unique characteristic can impair the performance of the reliable transport layer widely deployed protocol, TCP, in attaining high throughput and low latency throughout a fair network. As a result, the protocol needs to adjust the congestion window size based on the current situation of the network. However, TCP is not able to adjust its congestion window efficiently, and it leads to throughput degradation of the protocol.

Several predictive monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past. However, so far those prediction techniques have been assessed only independently from each other, making it hard to reliably compare their applicability and accuracy. We empirically analyze and compare three main classes of predictive monitoring techniques, which are based on machine learning, constraint satisfaction, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) aggregation. Based on empirical evidence from an industrial case study in the area of transport and logistics, we assess those techniques with respect to five accuracy indicators. We further determine the dependency of accuracy on the point in time during process execution when a prediction is made in order to determine lead-times for accurate predictions. Our evidence suggests that, given a lead-time of half of the process duration, all predictive monitoring techniques consistently provide an accuracy of at least 70%. Yet, it also becomes evident that the techniques differ in terms of how accurately they may predict violations and nonviolations. To improve the prediction process, we thus exploit the characteristics of the individual techniques and propose their combination. Based on our case study data, evidence indicates that certain combinations of techniques may outperform individual techniques with respect to specific accuracy indicators.

However, the efficiency of clustering algorithms decreases as the amount of data increases. In addition, most of the existing methods optimize only one objective and therefore may be suitable only for datasets with certain features. To address these limitations, in this paper, we develop a new hybrid chain-hypergraph P system (named HCHPS), which makes full use of the parallelism of P systems as well as the advantages of chain and hypergraph topology structures for accurate and efficient clustering. Our new P system comprises three types of subsystems, i.e., reaction chain membrane subsystems, local communication membrane subsystems and global ensemble membrane subsystems. Each type of subsystems is implemented end-to-end in HCHPS with new rules and membrane structures in parallel. In particular, to obtain efficient clustering center objects and make the algorithm robust to data with various features, the reaction chain membrane subsystems perform three different multiobjective strategies simultaneously by new chain evolution rules. To increase the population diversity of cluster centers, the local communication membrane subsystems utilize transport rules between membranes for coevolution of nondominated objects. The global ensemble membrane subsystems conduct a new dense representation multisize ensemble strategy to further improve the accuracy of the final results. Evaluations on two artificial data sets and 17 real-life data sets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in correctly clustering data sets with different dimensions and shapes. Our experimental results outperform those of both baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

However, this is not an easy task because many aspects need to be considered to make realistic recommendations: the context of a tourist destination visited, lack of updated information about points of interest, transport information, weather forecast, etc. The recommendations concerning a tourist destination must be linked to the interests and constraints of the tourist. In this research, we present a mobile recommender system based on Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP)/Time Depending (TD) - Orienteering Problem (OP) - Time Windows (TW), which analyzes in real time the user's constraints and the points of interest's constraints. For solving TTDP, we clustered preferences depending on the number of days that a tourist will visit a tourist destination using a k-means algorithm. Then, with a genetic algorithm (GA), we optimize the proposed itineraries to tourists for facilitating the organization of their visits. We also used a parametrized fitness function to include any element of the context to generate an optimized recommendation. Our recommender is different from others because it is scalable and adaptable to environmental changes and users' interests, and it offers real-time recommendations.

As a result, improving network performance for HSR scenarios has become urgent and widespread concerns. Some previous works quantitatively analyzed the TCP performance on HSR and proposed relevant solutions. Other works focused on the handover problem (the leading cause of poor network performance on HSR), and proposed a series of handover algorithms for HSR scenarios. However, the existing works are either limited to only measurement studies without algorithm implementation or lack of integration with real-world scenarios.

Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as a key technology for next-generation networks because it contains advanced functions such as centralized control, software-based traffic analysis, and forwarding rules for dynamic updates. In this paper, an SDN with flexible architecture is considered and a transport component is proposed. The component based on mesh topology is an example of joint route prediction and forwarding. First, different from existing transport protocols, the component can adopt a software-defined stream access control strategy that includes an extended forwarding mechanism (retransmission) to improve the short-term response performance. Second, we evaluate the impact of route prediction on transport network performance by using offline training and prediction. The key challenge here is that a suitable model needs to be trained from a limited training sample dataset, which will dynamically update the forwarding rules based on current and historical facts (network data).

Network connectivity allows IoT devices to collect and exchange data. The prevalence of IoT devices has increased rapidly in last five years, driven by cheaper electronics and a desire to monitor and control the physical world. We introduce the concept of IoT flood to describe the increased use of IoT devices. Just like the data deluge, the IoT flood has potential benefits and risks. This paper focuses on the hidden side effects of the increased usage of IoT, such as energy consumption, physical pollution, radiation, and health issues.

10.1109/TNSE.2020.2998536,PassengerFlows: A Correlation-Based Passenger Estimator in Automated Public Transport,IEEE,Journals,"Human mobility information is widely needed by many sectors in smart cities, especially for public transport. This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively. When the devices' brands are split for creating a regression model, compared with two counting-based approaches, the proposed passenger estimation algorithm results in lower errors with a mean of 3.15 and a variance of 9.29.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9103621/,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,1 Oct.-Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Such a system fits naturally with the development of an external vision system proposed by NASA for use in high-speed civil transport aircraft with limited cockpit visibility. The detection techniques should provide high detection probability for obstacles that can vary from subpixels to a few pixels in size, while maintaining a low false alarm probability in the presence of noise and severe background clutter. Furthermore, the detection algorithms must be able to report such obstacles in a timely fashion, imposing severe constraints on their execution time. For this purpose, we have implemented a number of algorithms to detect airborne obstacles using image sequences obtained from a camera mounted on an aircraft. This paper describes the methodology used for characterizing the performance of the dynamic programming obstacle detection algorithm and its special cases. The experimental results were obtained using several types of image sequences, with simulated and real backgrounds. The approximate performance of the algorithm is also theoretically derived using principles of statistical analysis in terms of the signal-to-noise ration (SNR) required for the probabilities of false alarms and misdetections to be lower than prespecified values.

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

The real-time monitoring and data recording function of vehicle-mounted equipment provides data support for vehicle status assessment and fault warning. In this paper, the real-time data collected by CAN-BUS system of Beijing Bus Group are preprocessed and discretized. On the basis of the traditional rough set theory, a new coding method is set up, and the dependency between conditional attributes and decision attributes is set as an adaptive function, which is reduced by genetic algorithm and cellular genetic algorithm respectively. The calculation results show that the key fault information of public transport vehicles is instrumental speed, oil pressure, percentage of torque, timing engine speed, and coolant temperature. By comparing the results of reduction, it is found that the cellular genetic algorithm has higher applicability than the genetic algorithm in terms of algorithm efficiency, stability, and convergence quality. Although the genetic algorithm attribute reduction is slightly better than the cellular genetic algorithm attribute reduction in the rule matching, the cellular genetic algorithm has a better ability to excavate information within the acceptable compatibility range. Finally, the selected key factors will be deployed on the Beijing Bus Group's big data platform and displayed in real time.

Therefore, Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label (M3) learning provides a framework for handling such task and has exhibited excellent performance. However, M3 learning is facing two main challenges: 1) how to effectively utilize label correlation and 2) how to take advantage of multi-modal learning to process unlabeled instances. To solve these problems, we first propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-instance Multi-label Deep Network (M3DN), which considers M3 learning in an end-to-end multi-modal deep network and utilizes consistency principle among different modal bag-level predictions. Based on the M3DN, we learn the latent ground label metric with the optimal transport. Moreover, we introduce the extrinsic unlabeled multi-modal multi-instance data, and propose the M3DNS, which considers the instance-level auto-encoder for single modality and modified bag-level optimal transport to strengthen the consistency among modalities. Thereby M3DNS can better predict label and exploit label correlation simultaneously.

Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time.

The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users' mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, SFC placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The objective functions of this MILP-based problem formulation are to minimize (i) the service provisioning cost, (ii) the transport network utilization, and (iii) the service interruption.

But this task is very difficult and challenging due to the dynamic condition of roads. Many solutions have been given by the researchers to overcome these challenges. Some of them are giving good performance but computationally highly expensive and fail in some circumstances. In the proposed method, a feature based cost effective detection and classification method is proposed that is suitable for real time applications, provide satisfactory accuracy and computationally cheap. The proposed method uses haar-like features of the images and AdaBoost classifier for detection which provides a very fast detection rate with high accuracy. To reduce inconsiderable false positive rate generated by this method, we propose to use two virtual detection lines (VDL) that reduces the false positive rate. In order to predict the class of a vehicle, a feature based method is proposed. HOG, SIFT, SURF all are well represented feature for image classification. The existing feature based vehicle classification methods lack accuracy because of using those features inefficiently. In order to reduce those lacking, we propose to use bag of visual words (BOVW) model for classification. BOVW model also needs a lower computation time and resources. As the proposed method aims to be implemented in real time, we propose to use SURF feature for BOVW which is faster to compute and well described for recognizing an object. The BOVW then used for identifying the vehicle's class by multi class SVM classifier. Error correcting output code (ECOC) framework is used to achieve multi class prediction with SVM. Extensive experiments have been carried out on different traffic data of varying environments to evaluate the detection and classification performance of the proposed method. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in classification of heterogeneous vehicles in terms of accuracy with a considerable execution time as compared to other methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8281786/,2017 20th International Conference of Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT),22-24 Dec. 2017,ieeexplore

These are recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). In ITS, network services and applications (e.g., safety messages) will require an exchange of vehicle and event location information. Effective lane changing and routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks is a challenging task. This paper aims to propose a solution to ensure the safety of drivers while changing lanes on the highways. Efficient and faster routing protocols could play a crucial role in the applications of ITS, safeguarding both the drivers and the passengers and thus maintaining a safe on-road environment.

While there are a number of treatments and technologies to effectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these are most needed remains a challenge. Mid-block locations, where safety countermeasures are often needed the most, are typically harder to monitor. Current practice often requires manual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to an identification process that is often time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern changes over time, and lacks scalability. As a result, target locations are often selected reactively, after serious traffic incidents reveal an underlying safety issue. We propose an approach to use data collected by existing traffic monitoring cameras to automatically identify pedestrian activities on the road. We propose an algorithm to detect pedestrian crossing events based on the detection of individuals on individual video frames using a deep neural network model. Resulting pedestrian locations and movement trajectories can be visualized on a background image, which is automatically extracted at the analyzed location from the video. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach with a real-world use case. The case study considered in this work uses cameras owned by the City of Austin, Texas to study pedestrian road use before and after the deployment of a pedestrian-hybrid beacon. We explore qualitative and quantitative metrics to describe pedestrian activity and corresponding changes, which may be used to prioritize the deployment of pedestrian safety solutions, or evaluate their performance. We compared the number of crossing events detected per hour with manually reviewed results from a selected day. The result shows 67 percent overall accuracy, although we observe significant variability across times-of-day.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore

Accurate modelling of a large and complex system requires large datasets to train a deep neural network that causes a challenge of scale as training the network and serving the model are computationally and memory intensive. One example of a complex system that produces a large number of spatial time-series is a large road sensor infrastructure deployed for traffic monitoring. The goal of this work is twofold: 1) To model large amount of spatial time-series from road sensors; 2) To address the scalability problem in a real-life task of large-scale road traffic prediction which is an important part of an Intelligent Transportation System.We propose a partitioning technique to tackle the scalability problem that enables parallelism in both training and prediction: 1) We represent the sensor system as a directed weighted graph based on the road structure, which reflects dependencies between sensor readings, and weighted by sensor readings and inter-sensor distances; 2) We propose an algorithm to automatically partition the graph taking into account dependencies between spatial time-series from sensors; 3) We use the generated sensor graph partitions to train a prediction model per partition. Our experimental results on traffic density prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks show that the partitioning-based models take 2x, if run sequentially, and 12x, if run in parallel, less training time, and 20x less prediction time compared to the unpartitioned model of the entire road infrastructure. The partitioning-based models take 100x less total sequential training time compared to single sensor models, i.e., one model per sensor. Furthermore, the partitioning-based models have 2x less prediction error (RMSE) compared to both the single sensor models and the entire road model.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005475/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),9-12 Dec. 2019,ieeexplore

Intersections are the most complex part of the road network, as they involve various participants, such as vehicles and pedestrians. Therefore, providing an accurate traffic flow prediction model will enhance traffic efficiency and reduce common problems, such as accidents, congestion and air pollution. However, there are two challenges in the traffic flow prediction problem: first, traffic is a dynamic nonlinear problem due to nonrecurrent events, such as accidents and roadworks, that occur near intersections as an unexpected event will impact the accuracy of the prediction method. The second challenge is that there is a large amount of data which needs a scalable model to efficiently handle big data. To overcome the first issue, in this study, accidents and roadworks data are used, in addition to sensor data that are updated in real time.

In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions.

The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article.

However, incomplete traffic time-series data during the data analysis are nearly inevitable due to the constraints of data collection or packet loss in the communication process. Existing tensor-based completion methods fail to perform well in consecutively missing (CM) cases where a sub-series of the traffic time series is completely missing. Moreover, their high computational complexity prevents the road network-level implementation. Therefore, to tackle these problems, a batch-oriented traffic data completion method for large-scale road networks is proposed in this paper. In order to preserve multi-way natures of traffic data, we first model the traffic data by tensors so that traffic data completion becomes a tensor completion problem. Several types of tensor structures are adopted in order to analyze their impacts on traffic data completion. Thereafter, a Content-Aware traffic data completion method is further developed based on the Generative Adversarial Net (CA-GAN). More specifically, the formulated traffic tensors are interpreted as samples from a high-dimensional traffic distribution and a GAN is then proposed to learn this distribution. By considering effects of traffic data from different days and links, a weighted loss function is employed to search for the raw traffic tensor in the obtained traffic distribution. Afterwards, the estimated raw traffic tensor is used to complete the missing data. Visualization results demonstrate that our GANs can produce verisimilar traffic patterns with different time spans. Finally, our experiments on real traffic datasets show that the proposed CA-GAN method can effectively batch incomplete traffic tensors in CM cases with fast recovery process.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9133309/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Oct. 2020,ieeexplore

In the literature, recent efforts have applied various deep learning methods for traffic forecasting, e.g., leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for spatial dependency modeling, and utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for capturing temporal dynamics. However, most of the existing approaches assume that spatial correlations are static and temporal correlations have only sequential dependencies and do not consider temporal periodicity of traffic across multiple time steps.

Besides, this paper proposes a model based on ensemble models, called “Triplet Decoders Neural Network” (TDNN), to compare with these methods. By analyzing the characteristic of traffic speed data, this paper also proposes a data preprocessing model called “T-Conversion” to help RNN capturing long-term dependencies. Our experiments are implemented based on real traffic speed data from Baidu in Beijing, China because the prediction for complex traffic is more valuable. With these new novel ideas, our experiments show the superior performances of TDNN, and the significant effect of T-Conversion for predicting traffic speed sequences.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8892399/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore
