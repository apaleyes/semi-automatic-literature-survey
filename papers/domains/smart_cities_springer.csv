This not only enhances pollution but also leads to several road accident fatalities which may be greatly reduced by proper monitoring and surveillance. Further, with the advent of UAV technology and due to the incompatibility of traditional techniques, surveillance has become one of UAVs prominent application domains. However, it requires algorithmic analysis of aerial images which becomes extremely challenging due to multi-scale rotating objects with large aspect ratios, extremely imbalanced categories, cluttered background, and birds-eye view. Therefore, this article presents the novel aerial image traffic monitoring and surveillance algorithms based on the most advanced and popular DL object detection models (Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4) using the AU-AIR dataset. This dataset is exceedingly imbalanced and to resolve this issue, another 500 images have been grabbed by web-mining techniques. The novel contribution of this work is two-fold. First, this article scientifically distinguishes the inappropriateness of ground-view images for aerial object detection. Second, a regress comparison of these algorithms has been made to investigate their effectiveness. Extensive experimental analysis endorses the efficiency of YOLOv4 as it outperforms the other developed models by a minimum mAP margin of 88%. Also, more than 6 times high detection speed and greater adaptability with stronger detection robustness ensure its real-time practical implementation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-021-11146-x,springer

The resilience of a city, from our perspective, should also rely on ICT. Resilience as a service implies predictive modelling and “what if” analysis for better reaction at unpredictable events and providing emergency services in critical modes of city life. Resilience as a property of a city means working as normally as possible for citizens when extreme events occur and also adaptively react and change the system’s behavior when normal mode has no chance to be applied. This paper provides a review and analysis of the resilient properties of existing Smart City frameworks and offers a new concept of a resilient city based on the Demand-Resource (DR) model, multi-agent system (MAS) and ontologies. The main idea of this concept is to create an ICT framework that is resilient by design. For this, it should operate as a digital ecosystem of smart services. The framework development process is divided into two main steps: first to create Smart City simulation software for modelling, planning, and strategic assessment of urban areas as a set of models at different levels of abstraction.

However, the number of available bikes in different stations may be imbalanced due to the free check-in and check-out of users. Therefore, predicting the bike demand in each station is an important task in a city to satisfy requests in different stations. Recent works mainly focus on demand prediction in settled stations, which ignore the realistic scenarios that bike stations may be deployed or removed. To predict station-level demands with evolving new stations, we face two main challenges: (1) How to effectively capture new interactions in time-evolving station networks; (2) How to learn spatial patterns for new stations due to the limited historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel S patial C ommunity-informed E volving G raphs (SCEG) framework to predict station-level demands, which considers two different grained interactions. Specifically, we learn time-evolving representation from fine-grained interactions in evolving station networks using EvolveGCN.

Despite, the benefits accrued by the introduction of traffic management solutions (e.g. improved travel times, maximisation of throughput, etc.), these solutions usually fall short on ensuring the environmental sustainability around the implementation areas. This is because the environmental dimension (e.g. vehicle emissions) is usually absent from the optimisation methodologies adopted for traffic management strategies. Nonetheless, since environmental performance corresponds as a primary goal of contemporary mobility planning, solutions that can guarantee air quality are significant. This study presents an advanced Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) signal control framework, able to incorporate environmental considerations into the core of signal optimisation processes. More specifically, a highly flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm has been developed in order to identify efficient but -more importantly- environmentally friendly signal control strategies. The methodology is deployed on a large-scale micro-simulation environment able to realistically represent urban traffic conditions. Alternative signal control strategies are designed, applied, and evaluated against their achieved traffic efficiency and environmental footprint. Based on the results obtained from the application of the methodology on a core part of the road urban network of Nicosia, Cyprus the best strategy achieved a 4.8% increase of the network throughput, 17.7% decrease of the average queue length and a remarkable 34.2% decrease of delay while considerably reduced the CO emissions by 8.1%.

However, although these processes are sufficient for theoretical experiments, they often fail when they meet the reality of city data and processes, which by their very nature are highly distributed, heterogeneous, and exhibit high degrees of spatial and temporal variance. In order to address those problems, we have designed and implemented an integrated development environment called CityFlow that supports developing machine learning applications. With CityFlow, we can develop, deploy, and maintain machine learning applications easily by using an intuitive data flow model. To verify our approach, we conducted two case studies: deploying a road damage detection application to help monitor transport infrastructure and an automatic labeling application in support of a participatory sensing application.

The collection of this valuable data opens effective opportunities for routine prediction. With the growing ability of vehicles to collect spatial and temporal information solving the routine prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible. It is then extremely important to advance and take advantage of the capabilities of these cockpit systems. A vehicle that is capable of predicting the next destination of the driver and when the driver intends to leave to that destination can prepare the journey in advance. Previous studies tackling the next location prediction problem have made use of Traditional Markov models, Neural Networks, Dynamic models, among others. In this work, a framework based on the hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm followed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is proposed for spatial-temporal prediction of drivers’ routines.

To analyze the complex and dynamic topologies of these scalable applications a simulation based analysis plays a vital role in realizing the effective deployment of vehicles in realistic scenarios and its corresponding effect on routing protocols. Mobility models mimic the movement of vehicles and we consider Manhattan, City section and INVENT mobility models for our analysis. We measure the performances of these mobility models with suitable mobility metrics and try to correlate its corresponding impact on the performances of routing protocols. Routing protocols play a central role in the design of these types of networks. To meet the challenging requirements of the vehicular networks we analyze the suitability of a reinforcement learning based routing algorithm. We compare the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm with AODV which is considered as one of the robust routing protocols under varying traffic and load conditions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-14825-5_20,springer

In this field, we have been working on a wearable mobility aid aimed at detecting in real-time obstacles in front of a visually impaired. Our approach relies on a custom RGBD camera, with FPGA on-board processing, worn as traditional eyeglasses and effective point-cloud processing implemented on a compact and lightweight embedded computer. This latter device also provides feedback to the user by means of an haptic interface as well as audio messages. In this paper we address crosswalk recognition that, as pointed out by several visually impaired users involved in the evaluation of our system, is a crucial requirement in the design of an effective mobility aid. Specifically, we propose a reliable methodology to detect and categorize crosswalks by leveraging on point-cloud processing and deep-learning techniques. The experimental results reported, on 10000+ frames, confirm that the proposed approach is invariant to head/camera pose and extremely effective even when dealing with large occlusions typically found in urban environments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-23222-5_35,springer

It combines the robustness of detectors based on classification methods with an innovative perspective multi-scale procedure to scan the images that dramatically reduces the computational cost associated with robust detectors. In our experiments we compare different implementation classifiers in search for a trade-off between the real-time constraint of embedded platforms and the high detection rates required by safety applications.,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-02895-8_58,springer

One reason for this development is the level of maturity of both theory of AI concepts and its implementation into application tools for commercial use. Another very important reason is the persistent drive of many industries to increase efficiencies and the realisation that this requires more effective processing of gained knowledge and information. In the oil and gas industry, due to high saturation levels of many production fields and the complex nature of processes, the need for increased efficiencies and highly effective processing of a large amount of information is particularly evident. Some organisations have recognised the opportunities offered by AI-based techniques and started exploiting them in order to improve knowledge and information handling and process efficiencies. This paper discusses the application of two AI-based techniques, fuzzy logic (FL) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to specific problems related to the operation of oil and gas transport facilities. The background for the work, which is carried out in a co-operation between a university and a leading engineering service provider, is described firstly. This is followed by a brief summary of the fundamentals of the AI techniques considered with respect to their use for industrial purposes. then, two case studies are presented. The first case study demonstrates the application of fuzzy logic to the control of a pump station in a pipieline system whilst the second case study shows the use of an ANN for the determination of important pipeline characteristic. Problem backgrounds, design procedures and outlines for the implementation of the used AI techniques are given. Finally, benefits of the adopted approaches are highlighted and the wider impact on both industry and research community is discussed.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-0465-0_8,springer
