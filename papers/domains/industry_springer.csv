The goal of this architecture is to reduce the implementation effort of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in CPPS. Declarative user goals and the provided algorithm-knowledge base allow the dynamic pipeline orchestration and configuration. A big data platform (BDP) instantiates the pipelines and monitors the CPPS performance for further evaluation through the cognitive module. Thus, the cognitive module is able to select feasible and robust configurations for process pipelines in varying use cases. Furthermore, it automatically adapts the models and algorithms based on model quality and resource consumption. The cognitive module also instantiates additional pipelines to evaluate algorithms from different classes on test functions. CAAI relies on well-defined interfaces to enable the integration of additional modules and reduce implementation effort. Finally, an implementation based on Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka for the virtualization and orchestration of the individual modules and as messaging technology for module communication is used to evaluate a real-world use case.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-021-07248-3,springer

The implementation of smart factories represents a leap forward compared to traditional automation. It is underpinned by the deployment of cyberphysical systems that, through the application of Artificial Intelligence, integrate predictive capabilities and foster rapid decision-making. Deep Learning (DL) is a key enabler for the development of smart factories. However, the implementation of DL in smart factories is hindered by its reliance on large amounts of data and extreme computational demand. To address this challenge, Transfer Learning (TL) has been proposed to promote the efficient training of models by enabling the reuse of previously trained models. In this paper, by means of a specific example in aluminium can manufacturing, an empirical study is presented, which demonstrates the potential of TL to achieve fast deployment of scalable and reusable predictive models for Cyber Manufacturing Systems. Through extensive experiments, the value of TL is demonstrated to achieve better generalisation and model performance, especially with limited datasets. This research provides a pragmatic approach towards predictive model building for cyber twins, paving the way towards the realisation of smart factories.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-021-01804-0,springer

In fact, AM is a main accelerator for digital production with its possibilities in structural design, such as topology optimization, production flexibility, customization, product development, to name a few. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a widespread and practical tool for rapid prototyping that also demonstrates the importance of AM technologies through its accessibility to the general public by creating cost effective desktop solutions. An increasing integration of systems in an intelligent production environment also enables the generation of large-scale data to be used for process monitoring and process control. Deep learning as a form of artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically, a method of machine learning (ML) is ideal for handling big data. This study uses a trained artificial neural network (ANN) model as a digital shadow to predict the force within the nozzle of an FFF printer using filament speed and nozzle temperatures as input data. After the ANN model was tested using data from a theoretical model it was implemented to predict the behavior using real-time printer data. For this purpose, an FFF printer was equipped with sensors that collect real time printer data during the printing process. The ANN model reflected the kinematics of melting and flow predicted by models currently available for various speeds of printing. The model allows for a deeper understanding of the influencing process parameters which ultimately results in the determination of the optimum combination of process speed and print quality.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11740-021-01020-y,springer

Such a task could be difficult with existing means, while the proposed approach might reduce it to a trivial calculation. In a similar fashion, it is possible to use simulation models for data analysis and model validation, by feeding the existing simulation models with varying conditions and comparing the results with the real ones.

When implemented, Industry 4.0 technologies have a huge impact on efficiency, productivity and profitability of businesses. The adoption and implementation of Industry 4.0, however, require to overcome a number of practical challenges, in most cases, due to the lack of modernisation and automation in place with traditional manufacturers. This paper presents a first of its kind case study for moving a traditional food manufacturer, still using the machinery more than one hundred years old, a common occurrence for small- and medium-sized businesses, to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies. The paper reports the challenges we have encountered during the transformation process and in the development stage. The paper also presents a smart production control system that we have developed by utilising AI, machine learning, Internet of things, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing technologies. The system provides novel data collection, information extraction and intelligent monitoring services, enabling improved efficiency and consistency as well as reduced operational cost. The platform has been developed in real-world settings offered by an Innovate UK-funded project and has been integrated into the company’s existing production facilities. In this way, the company has not been required to replace old machinery outright, but rather adapted the existing machinery to an entirely new way of operating.

The automotive manufacturing industry stands to greatly benefit from NDE 4.0, but its implementation presents many challenges that must be overcome. In this chapter, we discuss the benefits and challenges of Industry/NDE 4.0 in the context of automotive manufacturing. We discuss signal/image processing and AI, and elaborate on the roles of AI (particularly deep learning) in Industry/NDE 4.0. We then present an intriguing case study which highlights the considerations and challenges of transforming a preexisting NDE system for an automotive application – real-time integrated resistance spot weld analysis – for NDE 4.0, through the integration of AI. This case study involves discussion of the original automated NDE system, the development of a deep learning component for NDE data interpretation, and the considerations for the development of a feedback system including further development of an adaptive control algorithm for resistance spot welding. These elements (automated NDE data acquisition and big data storage, AI-based interpretation, feedback, and adaptive control) are essential to NDE 4.0, Industry 4.0, and the concept of zero-defect manufacturing in the automotive industry.

New concepts in design and control allow expanding their applications in different fields. The vast amount of data have been collected almost in any domain of interest. They can be static; that is to say, they represent real-world processes at a fixed point of time. Vibration analysis and vibration monitoring, including how to detect and monitor anomalies in vibration data are widely used techniques for predictive maintenance in high-speed rotating machines. However, accurately identifying the presence of a bearing fault can be challenging in practice, especially when the failure is still at its incipient stage, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the monitored signal is small. The main objective of this work is to design a system that will analyze the vibration signals of a rotating machine, based on recorded data from sensors, in the time/frequency domain. As a consequence of such substantial interest, there has been a dramatic increase of interest in applying Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to this task. An ML system will be used to classify and detect abnormal behavior and recognize the different levels of machine operation modes (normal, degraded, and faulty).

In 2013, the “Industry 4.0 Proclamation” was put into practicality and promulgates the modernity of both strategic and intelligent industries in the twenty-first century. This new phenomenon of Industry 4.0 repositions the traditional manpower management into a modern concept of Smart Human Resources 4.0 (SHR 4.0). The study aims to find various strategies to manage manpower in Industry 4.0. It also specifies essential skills and competencies required for SHR4.0. Lastly, the study identifies different changes, benefits, and challenges associated with implementation of SHR 4.0. The exploratory study is based on qualitative analysis of secondary data. Systematic review technique is used for the collection of data from relevant research papers related to the objective of the study. The notion of SHR 4.0 facilitates the emergence of innovative technologies for which the new generation employees require the potential to reconstruct end to end HR processes. The key benefits behind this new notion include appointment of non-substitutable talent, decentralization of authority, promotion of creativity and innovativeness, effective utilization of manpower, and leaner human resource departments. This also accounts for few chief challenges in the form of appropriate selection of advanced technological tools, a control on the expectations of multigenerational manpower, and finally encourages a culture of willingness to adapt SHR 4.0.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-0182-8_42,springer

The most typical case in the production line is product inspection, that is, defect inspection. To implement an efficient and robust detection system, in this study, we propose a classification computing model based on Lie Group Machine Learning, which can find the possible defective products in production. Usually, a workshop has a lot of assembly lines. How to process large data on so many production lines in real-time and accurately is a difficult problem. To solve this problem, we use the concept of fog computing to design the system. By offloading the computation burden from the cloud server center to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely data. Our system has two obvious advantages. The first one is to apply Lie Group Machine Learning to fog computing environment to improve the computational efficiency and robustness of the system. The other is that without increasing any production costs, it can quickly detect products, reduce network latency, and reduce the load on bandwidth. The simulations prove that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method has an average running efficiency increase of 52.57%, an average delay reduction of 42.13%, and an average accuracy increase of 27.86%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-020-01570-5,springer

This process often leads to the construction of a real-time, collaborative, and intelligent virtual factory of their physical factory (so-called digital twin). The application of digital twins and frontier technologies in production planning still faces many challenges. But the research is still limited about how these frontier technologies can be applied to enhance production planning. This paper introduces how to enhance material resource planning (MRP) with digital twins and other frontier technologies, and presents a framework for the integration of MRP software with digital twin technologies. Indeed, the data collected from the shop floor can improve the accuracy of the optimization models used in the MRP software. First, several MRP parameters are unknown when planning, and some of these parameters may be accurately forecasted from the data with machine learning. Nevertheless, the forecast will never be perfect, and the variability of some parameters may have a critical impact on the resulting plan. Therefore, the optimization approach must properly account for these uncertainties, and some methods must allow building probability distribution from the data. Second, as the optimization models in MRP are based on aggregated data, the resulting plans are usually not implementable in practice. The capacity constraints may be acquired by communication with an accurate simulation of the execution of the plan on the shop floor.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-85874-2_34,springer

This paper proposes a deep learning-based quality identification method for metal AM process. To alleviate the requirement for large amounts of high-quality labeled training data by most existing data-driven methods, an identification consistency-based approach is proposed to better explore the semi-supervised training data. The proposed method is able to achieve promising performance using limited supervised samples with low quality, such as noisy and blurred images.

Proper handling of software vulnerabilities is essential in the industrial context, particularly when the software is deployed in critical infrastructures. Therefore, several industrial standards mandate secure coding guidelines and industrial software developers’ training, as software quality is a significant contributor to secure software. CyberSecurity Challenges (CSC) form a method that combines serious game techniques with cybersecurity and secure coding guidelines to raise secure coding awareness of software developers in the industry. These cybersecurity awareness events have been used with success in industrial environments. However, until now, these coached events took place on-site.

The major drawbacks of such manual quality assessment include inter-observer variability, intra-observer variability, lack of speed and poor accuracy. In order to address these challenges, an automated approach, based on machine vision and machine learning, is investigated in this study. Methods Micrographs, obtained during an emulsification process, are classified into four quality-based categories named TAMU (target, acceptable, marginal and unacceptable). A machine learning approach using principal component–based discriminant analysis is employed in this study for the classification. This approach is compared with manual classification results obtained for the same set of micrographs using attribute agreement analysis, which is a methodology of assessing the accuracy and precision of an evaluation system. Results The automated approach is demonstrated to be repeatable, 40% more accurate compared to the least performing analyst and 10% more accurate than the best performing analyst. The results show that the automated classification is superior to manual classification of micrographs with respect to speed (180 times faster), greater accuracy and repeatability. Conclusions The automated approach, implemented as a soft sensor, integrated with real-time image acquisition can be applied for in situ process monitoring of emulsions. The real-time approach can be used to predict the instantaneous product quality as well as optimum process time required to achieve the desirable droplet characteristics, which will avoid over-processing and wastage of resources in pharmaceutical industries.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12247-019-09390-8,springer

To achieve improved predictive performance, this paper presents a joint modeling method that incorporates classification and regression tasks into a single prediction model. Given the output variables in both binary and continuous forms, the prediction model simultaneously considers both the classification and regression tasks to complement each other, where each task predicts the binary and continuous output variables, respectively.

This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection.

A system, as the one presented herein, for raw food categorization is needed in future food industries to automate food classification according to type, the process of algorithm approaches that will be applied to every different food origin and also for serving disabled people. The purpose of this work was to develop a machine learning workflow based on supervised PLS regression and SVM classification, towards automated raw food categorization from FTIR. The system exhibited high efficiency in multi-class classification of 7 different types of raw food. The selected food samples, were diverse in terms of storage conditions (temperature, storage time and packaging), while the variability within each food was also taken into account by several different batches; leading in a classifier able to embed this variation towards increased robustness and efficiency, ready for real life applications targeting to the digital transformation of the food industry.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68156-2,springer

Proper diagnostic health assessment is essential for maximizing uptime and maintaining product and process quality. Information for diagnostic assessments, and reliability information in general, can come from a myriad of sources that can be processed and managed through numerous algorithms that range from simplistic to hypercomplex. One area that typifies the assortment of information sources in a modern manufacturing setting is found with the use of industrial robotics and automated manipulators. Although several monitoring methods and technologies have been previously proposed for this and other assets, adoption has been sporadic with returns on investment not always meeting expectations. Practical concerns regarding data limitations, variability of setup, and scarcity of ground truth points of validation from active industrial sites have contributed to this. This paper seeks to provide an overview of barriers and offer a feasible action plan for developing a practical condition monitoring information utilization program, matching available capabilities and assets to maximize knowledge gain.

The present design-oriented IS research study is concerned with an automated checkout solution in fashion retail stores. The implementation of such a cyberphysical system in established retail environments is challenging as architectural constraints, well-established customer processes, and customer expectations regarding privacy and convenience impose limits on system design. To overcome these challenges, the authors design an IT artifact that leverages an RFID sensor infrastructure and software components (data processing and prediction routines) to jointly address the central problems of detecting purchases in a reliable and timely fashion and assigning these purchases to individual shopping baskets. The system is implemented and evaluated in a research laboratory under real-world conditions. The evaluation indicates that shopping baskets can indeed be detected reliably (precision and recall rates greater than 99%) and in an expeditious manner (median detection time of 1.03 s). Moreover, purchase assignment reliability is 100% for most standard scenarios but falls to 42% in the most challenging scenario.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-018-0566-9,springer

Several machine learning (ML) tools are currently being used for direct marketing. However, the disadvantage of ML algorithmic models is that even though results could be accurate, they lack relevant explanations. The lack of detailed explanations that justify recommendations has led to reduced trust in ML-based recommendations for decision making in some critical real-world domains. The telecommunication domain has continued to witness a decline of revenue in core areas such as voice and text messaging services which make direct marketing useful to increase profit. This paper presents the conceptual design of a machine learning process framework that will enable telecom subscribers that should be targeted for direct marketing of new products to be identified, and also provide explanations for the recommendations. To do this, a hybrid framework that employs supervised learning, case-based reasoning and rule-based reasoning is proposed.

The challenge for the electronics industry is that product qualification testing is time-consuming and costly. This paper focuses on the development and demonstration of a novel approach for smarter qualification using test data from the production line along with integrated computational techniques for data mining/analytics and data-driven forecasting (i.e. prognostics) modelling. The most common type of testing in the electronics industry—sequentially run electrical multi-parameter tests on the Device-under-Test (DUT), is considered. The proposed data mining (DM) framework can identify the tests that have strong correlation to pending failure of the device in the qualification (tests sensitive to pending failure) as well as to evaluate the similarity in test measurements, thus generating knowledge on potentially redundant tests. Mining the data in this context and with the proposed approach represents a major new contribution because it uncovers embedded knowledge and information in the production test data that can enable intelligent optimisation of the tests’ sequence and reduce the number of tests. The intelligent manufacturing concept behind the development of data-driven prognostics models using machine learning techniques is to use data only from a small number of tests from the full qualification specification as training data in the process of model construction. This model can then forecast the overall qualification outcome for a DUT—Pass or Fail—without performing all other remaining tests. The novelty in the context of machine learning is in the selection of the data features for the training dataset using results from tests sensitive to pending failure. Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary classifiers SVM models built with data from tests sensitive to the outcome that the module will fail are shown to have superior performance compared with models trained with other datasets of tests. Case studies based on the use of real industrial production test data for an electronic module are included in the paper to demonstrate and validate the computational approach. This work is both novel and original because at present, to the best knowledge of the authors, such predictive analytics methodology applied to qualification testing and providing benefits of test time and hence cost reduction are non-existent in the electronics industry. The integrated data analytics-prognostics approach, deployable for both off-line and in-line optimisation of production test procedures, has the potential to transform current practices by exploiting in a smarter way information and knowledge available with large datasets of qualification test data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-018-01462-9,springer

In particular, an adaptation mechanism is introduced that automatically evaluates the performance of the network and then updates its weights to fit the current environmental conditions. The retraining algorithm trusts as much as possible the current conditions ( discriminative constraints ), while simultaneously providing a minimal degradation of the already obtained knowledge of the network ( generative constraints ). The underline assumption is that a small weight perturbation is adequate to modify the performance of the network to the new situations, without this constraint implying a small modification of the network output due to the highly non-linear surface that the network models. Under this assumption, we propose a computationally efficient re-training algorithm to tackle the variations of the visual environment, requiring a small number of labelled samples for the adaptation. Weight updating is combined with an unsupervised learning paradigm, implemented through stacked autoencoders, in order to improve convergence, stability and performance of the object tracking and labeling process by propagating the sensory inputs into deep level of hierarchies and therefore structuring the inputs from low representations to more abstract forms. Approximates of current visual environment are provided through a dynamic tracker that combines motion and learning features to automatically create few confident labeled data. The proposed retraining scheme is computationally efficient and able to model non-stationary environments, like the ones appeared in real-life computer vision application scenarios. Experimental results and comparisons are provided on video datasets of very complicated visual content, monitoring industrial workflows of car assembly within a manufactory. The results indicates that our self-adaptive deep neural network architecture is able to correctly label and separate foreground objects from background even under severe visual changes, such as occlusion, illumination variations and change of camera views, and within real time computational constraints.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-017-5349-7,springer

Unstructured images are images that does not have a pre-defined image model or is not organized in a predefined manner.

In this context, manufacturing companies require an innovative strategy to survive in a competitive business environment, utilizing those technologies. Guided by these requirements, the so-called predictive maintenance is of paramount importance and offers a significant potential for innovation to overcome the limitations of traditional maintenance policies. However, real shop-floors often have obstacles in providing insights to facilitate the effective management of assets in smart factories. Even if a significant amount of machine and process data is available, one of the common problems of these data is the lack of annotations describing the machine status or maintenance history. For this reason, companies have limited options to analyse manufacturing data, despite the capability of advanced machine learning techniques in supporting the identification of failure symptoms in order to optimize scheduling of maintenance operations. Moreover, each machine generates highly heterogeneous data, making it difficult to integrate all the information to provide data-driven decision support for predictive maintenance.

The traditional schemes are almost implemented on the system to control the outlet temperature of the inner tube by either the temperature or the flow of the fluid flowing, concurrently, through the shell tube. In some situations, the appropriate control scheme realization is not possible, due to the fact that the whole of system coefficients variation cannot quite be covered by the control action.

Thus, measuring and analyzing of vibration rate in gas turbines is very important and knowing about its operational conditions and prediction of this phenomenon can help a lot in reducing vibration, avoiding damage to the blades and eventually financial savings.

A result oriented company will not invest resources to fuel interesting solutions but only to increase the performance, quality and/or efficiency of products and processes. The return on investment has to be clear and fast. In consequence the justification of not only of an implementation but of a working integration process is a must have for a return on investment. The good news is: There are still relevant open questions in existing production companies with a need and a potential for approaches out of the variety of intelligent solutions. A solid fraction of these questions has a real chance for a successful approach with customized AI techniques.

One of the main goals in the automated factory environment is, therefore, the exploitation of resources to the full, in such a way as to optimize productivity. As widely documented in literature, this is a hard task on account of its computational complexity. For this reason a number of heuristic techniques are currently available, the best known of which are based on Event Graphs, which are a particular class of Petri Nets. The paper proposes a performance optimization technique which, although it is based on Event Graphs, applies algorithms which are different from traditional heuristic ones. More specifically, a novel neural model is used to solve the optimization problem. The neural model was obtained by making significant changes to a network that is well known in literature: the Hopfield network. The solution proposed is an original one and features several advantages against the most known heuristic approaches to the problem, the most important of which is the possibility of optimal or close to optimal solutions in a polynomial time, proportional to the size of the FMS. In addition, the possibility of simple, economical hardware implementation of the neural model favours its integration in the automated factory environment, allowing real-time supervision and optimization of productivity. The aim of the paper is to present the new neural model and its use in optimizing the performance of FMSs. A comparison of the neural approach with classical heuristic solutions and its real-time calculation capability, will also be treated in the paper.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008244007194,springer

Cutting velocity, feed, cutting force and machining time are given as inputs to the ANN, and the flank wear is estimated using the ANN. Different ANN structures are designed and investigated to estimate the tool wear accurately. An existing analytical model is used to obtain the data for various cutting conditions in order to eliminate the huge cost and time associated with generation of training and evaluation data. Motivated by the fact that the tool wear at a given instance of time depends on the tool wear value at a previous instance of time, memory is included in the ANN. ANNs without memory, with one-phase memory, and with two-phase memory are investigated in this study. The effect of various training parameters, such as learning coefficient, momentum, temperature, and number of hidden neurons, on these architectures is studied.

Chapter ConferencePaper,doi:10.1007/BFb0020319,A hardware implementation of hierarchical Neural Networks for real-time quality control systems in industrial applications,Artificial Neural Networks — ICANN'97,10.1007/BFb0020319,Springer,1997-01-01,"In this paper a real-time quality control system for steel industry is presented. The system implements the surface defect classification of steel strips in flat rolled mills in real-time. To achieve reliable classification accuracy the system implements a MLP_based hierarchical neural network. A dedicated hardware implementation has been designed and manufactured to meet the realtime constraints of the application. An ASIC neural chip directly implements the neural network and it is integrated on a custom high speed co-processor board, compatible with many commercial carrier board. The entire system has been tested with data coming from the plant.",2005-06-09,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BFb0020319,springer
Article,doi:10.1007/BF01179280,Concurrent design of manufacturing cell and control functions: A neural network approach,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.1007/BF01179280,Springer,1995-03-01,"This paper presents a neural network based decision support system (DSS) for use in concurrently determining cell configuration, operation plans, and complexity requirements of cell control functions. Advanced simulators and neural network technology are used in developing the DSS. Simulation experiments were conducted with many possible combinations of design changes to generate training pairs for a neural network. Complexity of cell control functions required by each design option was assessed, based on operational requirements, and was used to train another neural net. Once both neural networks are properly trained, one network can be used to predict the cell design configuration given a set of desirable cell performance measures, while the other network can be used to identify complexity requirements of the cell control functions by using the output provided by the first network as input to the second neural net. An operation-driven cell design methodology was applied to sequentially predict requirements of both cell configuration and cell control functions from the trained neural networks. This innovative new design methodology was illustrated via a successful implementation exercise in acquiring a real automated manufacturing cell at industrial settings. The exercise proves that such a DSS serves well as an effective tool for cell designers and the management in determining appropriate cell configuration and cell control functions at the design stage.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF01179280,springer

Case-based reasoning is a possible alternative to the problem of acquiring highly compiled expert knowledge, but it raises also many new problems that must be solved before really efficient implementations are available.",2005-05-27,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-57868-4_47,springer
Article,doi:10.1007/BF01471750,A synergistic approach to manufacturing systems control using machine learning and simulation,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,10.1007/BF01471750,Springer,1992-02-01,"This paper describes a synergistic approach that is applicable to a wide variety of system control problems. The approach utilizes a machine learning technique, goal-directed conceptual aggregation (GDCA), to facilitate dynamic decision-making. The application domain employed is Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) scheduling and control. Simulation is used for the dual purpose of providing a realistic depiction of FMSs, and serves as an engine for demonstrating the viability of a synergistic system involving incremental learning. The paper briefly describes prior approaches to FMS scheduling and control, and machine learning. It outlines the GDCA approach, provides a generalized architecture for dynamic control problems, and describes the implementation of the system as applied to FMS scheduling and control. The paper concludes with a discussion of the general applicability of this approach.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/BF01471750,springer
Chapter ConferencePaper,doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-7533-0_64,EVOLVABLE HARDWARE Genetic Programming of a Darwin Machine,Artificial Neural Nets and Genetic Algorithms,10.1007/978-3-7091-7533-0_64,Springer,1993-01-01,"For the past three years, the author has been dreaming of the possibility of building machines which are capable of evolution, called “Darwin Machines”. As a result of several brain storming sessions with some colleagues in electrical engineering, the author now realizes that hardware devices are on the market today, which use “software configurable hardware” technologies that the author believes can be used to build Darwin Machines within a year or two. This paper suggests there are at least two approaches to be taken. The first approach uses “software configurable hardware” chips, e.g. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), HDPLDs (High Density Programmable Logic Devices), or possibly a new generation of chips based on the ideas that FPGAs etc embody. The second approach uses a special hardware device called a “hardware accelerator” which accelerates the simulation in software of digital hardware devices containing up to several hundred thousand gates. Darwin Machines will be essential if artificial nervous systems are to be evolved for biots (i.e. biological robots) which consist of thousands of evolved neural network modules (called GenNets). The evolution time of 1000-GenNet biots will need to be reduced by many orders of magnitude if they are to be built at all. It is for this reason that Darwin Machines may prove to be a breakthrough in biotic design. When molecular scale technologies come on line in the late 1990s, the Darwin Machine approach will probably be the only way to build self assembling, self testing molecular scale devices.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-7533-0_64,springer
