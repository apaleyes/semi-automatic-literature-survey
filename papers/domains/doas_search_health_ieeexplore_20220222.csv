10.1109/JIOT.2021.3096637,An Integrated Framework for Health State Monitoring in a Smart Factory Employing IoT and Big Data Techniques,IEEE,Journals,"With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection, data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features, followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the BigInsights Data &amp; AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and techniques to address the data quality issues.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9481251/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Feb.1, 2022",ieeexplore

Even though there are several technological advancements made in this area, solutions like smartwatches are costly to afford and the solutions that rely on sensors and cameras suffer from privacy concerns. While wireless channel state information-based approaches can address some of these limitations, these approaches either require special hardware to be deployed or modifications at the WiFi access point. In this paper, we propose to detect human activities in a device-agnostic manner by leveraging passively captured passively captured WiFi MAC-layer traffic with the help of a sniffer. In that way, elderly people and those who suffer from chronic health conditions do not need to put any sensors on their body. This approach is not only cost-effective, but it is also easy to deploy without requiring any changes at the WiFi access point or installing special sensors in the environment. We train and test six off-the-shelf machine learning models on 15+ hours worth of WiFi MAC-layer traffic collected in a home environment. We present a proof-of-concept system prototype that employs this approach. We are able to detect six activities - (a) Walking vs Sitting, (b) Sleeping vs Awake, and (c) Using Phone vs Not Using Phone in three different real-world scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that WiFi MAC-layer traffic has special signatures to detect human activities and we are able to achieve 92.49 % detection accuracy in the best case.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9668420/,2022 14th International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS (COMSNETS),4-8 Jan. 2022,ieeexplore

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114590,Correlation-Aware Sport Training Evaluation for Players With Trust Based on Mahalanobis Distance,IEEE,Journals,"With the widely-adopted idea of health and longevity, sports have been becoming one of the most popular entertainment ways of the public. For the majority of sports, players need to know about their concrete physical conditions in a real time manner so as to pursue a good sport score or ranking in a competition or a race. Generally, we can achieve the above goal through analyzing and evaluating the daily training scores of each player. However, there are often multiple physical trainings for players and various correlations are existent among them, which significantly decrease the fairness and trust of player training score evaluation and ranking since traditional multi-dimensional data integration solutions are often based on a strong hypothesis, i.e., the involved multiple dimensions are independent with each other. In view of this shortcoming, we introduce the Mahalanobis Distance into the multi-dimensional player training score evaluation and further propose a <underline>c</underline>orrelation-aware <underline>p</underline>layer training score <underline>e</underline>valuation method with trust (abbreviated as CPE<sub>MD</sub>) based on <underline>M</underline>ahalanobis <underline>D</underline>istance. As Mahalanobis Distance can eliminate the hidden linear correlations among the involved multiple dimensions, we can guarantee the fairness and trust of Mahalanobis Distance-based player training score evaluation and ranking results. At last, we use a case study to show the feasibility of CPE<sub>MD</sub> in this paper.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9543705/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TIE.2021.3068681,Degradation Estimation and Prediction of Electronic Packages Using Data-Driven Approach,IEEE,Journals,"Recent trends in automotive electronics such as automated driving will increase the number and complexity of electronics used in safety-relevant applications. Applications in logistics or ridesharing will require a specific year of service rather than the conventional mileage usage. Reliable operations of the electronic systems must be assured at all times, regardless of the usage condition. A more dynamic and on-demand way of assuring the system availability will have to be developed. This article proposes a thermomechanical stress-based prognostics method as a potential solution. The goal is achieved by several novel advancements. On the experimental front, a key microelectronics package is developed to directly apply the prognostics and health management concept using a piezoresistive silicon-based stress sensor. Additional hardware for safe and secure data transmission and data processing is also developed, which is critically required for recording <italic>in situ</italic> and real-time data. On the data management front, proper data-driven approaches have to be identified to handle the unique dataset from the stress sensor employed in this study. The approaches effectively handle the massive amount of data that reveals the important information and automation of the prognostic process and thus to be able to detect, classify, locate, and predict the failure. The statistical techniques for diagnostics and the machine learning algorithms for health assessment and prognostics are also determined to implement the approaches in a simple, fast, but accurate way within the capacity of limited computing power. The proposed prognostics approach is implemented with actual microelectronics packages subjected to harsh accelerated testing conditions. The results corroborate the validity of the proposed prognostics approach.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9390342/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,March 2022,ieeexplore

10.1109/JBHI.2021.3119325,Mix-and-Interpolate: A Training Strategy to Deal With Source-Biased Medical Data,IEEE,Journals,"Till March 31st, 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had reportedly infected more than 127 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for management of individual patients as well as containment of the highly contagious disease. Having realized the clinical value of non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of COVID-19, deep learning (DL) based automated methods have been proposed to aid the radiologists in reading the huge quantities of CT exams as a result of the pandemic. In this work, we address an overlooked problem for training deep convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 classification using real-world multi-source data, namely, the <italic>data source bias</italic> problem. The data source bias problem refers to the situation in which certain sources of data comprise only a single class of data, and training with such source-biased data may make the DL models learn to distinguish data sources instead of COVID-19. To overcome this problem, we propose MIx-aNd-Interpolate (MINI), a conceptually simple, easy-to-implement, efficient yet effective training strategy. The proposed MINI approach generates volumes of the absent class by combining the samples collected from different hospitals, which enlarges the sample space of the original source-biased dataset. Experimental results on a large collection of real patient data (1,221 COVID-19 and 1,520 negative CT images, and the latter consisting of 786 community acquired pneumonia and 734 non-pneumonia) from eight hospitals and health institutions show that: 1) MINI can improve COVID-19 classification performance upon the baseline (which does not deal with the source bias), and 2) MINI is superior to competing methods in terms of the extent of improvement.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9568732/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Jan. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/TSMC.2020.3018102,Novel Fast and Automatic Condition Monitoring Strategy Based on Small Amount of Labeled Data,IEEE,Journals,"Signal-based automatic condition monitoring techniques are one of the effective ways to ensure the operational safety of modern industrial systems. Currently, the main challenge is to increase their effectiveness under noisy environment and with limited labeled data. In this article, a novel fast and automatic signal-based fault diagnosis procedure that does not require any kinds of machine learning algorithms is proposed. This procedure is based on the measurement of the similarity in the frequency domain between the collected data and a small amount of labeled reference signals (LRSs). The LRSs are obtained under various known operation conditions using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The proposed approach is suitable for a real-time implementation and capable of successfully overcoming the challenge of condition monitoring of rotating machines under noisy environment and with limited labeled data. The merits, fastness, and also robustness against noise of the proposed technique are demonstrated experimentally through different practical applications, as well as compared to state-of-the-art procedures on a database of vibration signals measured under a variety of machine health and working conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9194082/,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",Feb. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/JBHI.2021.3088750,Stroke Risk Prediction With Hybrid Deep Transfer Learning Framework,IEEE,Journals,"Stroke has become a leading cause of death and long-term disability in the world with no effective treatment. Deep learning-based approaches have the potential to outperform existing stroke risk prediction models, but they rely on large well-labeled data. Due to the strict privacy protection policy in health-care systems, stroke data is usually distributed among different hospitals in small pieces. In addition, the positive and negative instances of such data are extremely imbalanced. Transfer learning can solve small data issue by exploiting the knowledge of a correlated domain, especially when multiple source of data are available. In this work, we propose a novel Hybrid Deep Transfer Learning-based Stroke Risk Prediction (HDTL-SRP) scheme to exploit the knowledge structure from multiple correlated sources (i.e., external stroke data, chronic diseases data, such as hypertension and diabetes). The proposed framework has been extensively tested in synthetic and real-world scenarios, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art stroke risk prediction models. It also shows the potential of real-world deployment among multiple hospitals aided with 5 G/B5G infrastructures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9453166/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,Jan. 2022,ieeexplore
10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141913,Decentralized Federated Learning for Healthcare Networks: A Case Study on Tumor Segmentation,IEEE,Journals,"Smart healthcare relies on artificial intelligence (AI) functions for learning and analysis of patient data. Since large and diverse datasets for training of Machine Learning (ML) models can rarely be found in individual medical centers, classical centralized AI requires moving privacy-sensitive data from medical institutions to data centers that process the fused information. Training on data centers thus requires higher communication resource/energy demands while violating privacy. This is considered today as a significant bottleneck in pursuing scientific collaboration across trans-national clinical medical research centers. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed AI approach that enables the cooperative training of ML models, without the need of sharing patient data. This paper dives into the analysis of different FL methods and proposes a real-time distributed networking framework based on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In particular, we design a number of solutions for ML over networks, based on FL tools relying on a parameter server (PS) and fully decentralized paradigms driven by consensus methods. The proposed approach is validated in the context of brain tumor segmentation, using a modified version of the popular U-NET model with representative clinical datasets obtained from the daily clinical workflow. The FL process is implemented on multiple physically separated machines located in different countries and communicating over the Internet. The real-time test-bed is used to obtain measurements of training accuracy vs. latency trade-offs, and to highlight key operational conditions that affect the performance in real deployments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9676574/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore

However, despite the valuable healthcare services, this progression raises significant cybersecurity and privacy concerns. In this article, we focus our attention on the IEC 60 870-5-104 protocol, which is widely adopted in industrial healthcare systems. First, we investigate and assess the severity of the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks by providing a quantitative threat model, which relies on Attack Defence Trees and Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1. Next, we introduce an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), which is capable of discriminating and mitigating automatically the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks. The proposed IDPS takes full advantage of the machine learning (ML) and software defined networking (SDN) technologies. ML is used to detect the IEC 60 870-5-104 cyberattacks, utilizing 1) Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol network flow statistics and 2) IEC 60 870-5-104 payload flow statistics. On the other side, the automated mitigation is transformed into a multiarmed bandit problem, which is solved through a reinforcement learning method called Thomson sampling and SDN. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed IDPS in terms of intrusion detection accuracy and automated mitigation performance. The detection accuracy and the F1 score of the proposed IDPS reach 0.831 and 0.8258, respectively, while the mitigation accuracy is calculated at 0.923.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9470933/,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,March 2022,ieeexplore
