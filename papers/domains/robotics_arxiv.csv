  with Mobile Robots using RGB Data","Augmented Reality has been subject to various integration efforts within
industries due to its ability to enhance human machine interaction and
understanding. Neural networks have achieved remarkable results in areas of
computer vision, which bear great potential to assist and facilitate an
enhanced Augmented Reality experience. However, most neural networks are
computationally intensive and demand huge processing power thus, are not
suitable for deployment on Augmented Reality devices. In this work we propose a
method to deploy state of the art neural networks for real time 3D object
localization on augmented reality devices. As a result, we provide a more
automated method of calibrating the AR devices with mobile robotic systems. To
accelerate the calibration process and enhance user experience, we focus on
fast 2D detection approaches which are extracting the 3D pose of the object
fast and accurately by using only 2D input. The results are implemented into an
Augmented Reality application for intuitive robot control and sensor data
visualization. For the 6D annotation of 2D images, we developed an annotation
tool, which is, to our knowledge, the first open source tool to be available.
We achieve feasible results which are generally applicable to any AR device
thus making this work promising for further research in combining high
demanding neural networks with Internet of Things devices.",arxiv

learning to outperform traditional approaches to control physically embodied
robotic agents remains largely unproven. To help bridge this gap, we created
the 'AI Driving Olympics' (AI-DO), a competition with the objective of
evaluating the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence
for mobile robotics. Based on the simple and well specified autonomous driving
and navigation environment called 'Duckietown', AI-DO includes a series of
tasks of increasing complexity -- from simple lane-following to fleet
management. For each task, we provide tools for competitors to use in the form
of simulators, logs, code templates, baseline implementations and low-cost
access to robotic hardware. We evaluate submissions in simulation online, on
standardized hardware environments, and finally at the competition event. The
first AI-DO, AI-DO 1, occurred at the Neural Information Processing Systems
(NeurIPS) conference in December 2018. The results of AI-DO 1 highlight the
need for better benchmarks, which are lacking in robotics, as well as improved
mechanisms to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.",arxiv

robotics using traditional robotic tools that extend state-of-the-art DRL
implementations and provide an end-to-end approach which trains a robot
directly from joint states. Moreover, we present a novel technique to transfer
these DLR methods into the real robot, aiming to close the simulation-reality
gap. We demonstrate the robustness of the performance of state-of-the-art DRL
methods for continuous action spaces in modular robots, with an empirical study
both in simulation and in the real robot where we also evaluate how
accelerating the simulation time affects the robot's performance. Our results
show that extending the modular robot from 3 degrees-of-freedom (DoF), to 4
DoF, does not affect the robot's learning. This paves the way towards training
modular robots using DRL techniques.",arxiv

intelligent systems to solve a variety of complex problems. Recent years has
seen a surge of successes solving challenging games and smaller domain
problems, including simple though non-specific robotic manipulation and
grasping tasks. Rapid successes in RL have come in part due to the strong
collaborative effort by the RL community to work on common, open-sourced
environment simulators such as OpenAI's Gym that allow for expedited
development and valid comparisons between different, state-of-art strategies.
In this paper, we aim to start the bridge between the RL and the surgical
robotics communities by presenting the first open-sourced reinforcement
learning environments for surgical robots, called dVRL[3]{dVRL available at
https://github.com/ucsdarclab/dVRL}. Through the proposed RL environments,
which are functionally equivalent to Gym, we show that it is easy to prototype
and implement state-of-art RL algorithms on surgical robotics problems that aim
to introduce autonomous robotic precision and accuracy to assisting,
collaborative, or repetitive tasks during surgery. Learned policies are
furthermore successfully transferable to a real robot. Finally, combining dVRL
with the over 40+ international network of da Vinci Surgical Research Kits in
active use at academic institutions, we see dVRL as enabling the broad surgical
robotics community to fully leverage the newest strategies in reinforcement
learning, and for reinforcement learning scientists with no knowledge of
surgical robotics to test and develop new algorithms that can solve the
real-world, high-impact challenges in autonomous surgery.",arxiv

case of damage. However, robot damages are prevalent in real-world
applications, especially for robots deployed in extreme environments. The
fragility of robots greatly limits their widespread application. We propose an
adversarial reinforcement learning framework, which significantly increases
robot robustness over joint damage cases in both manipulation tasks and
locomotion tasks. The agent is trained iteratively under the joint damage cases
where it has poor performance. We validate our algorithm on a three-fingered
robot hand and a quadruped robot. Our algorithm can be trained only in
simulation and directly deployed on a real robot without any fine-tuning. It
also demonstrates exceeding success rates over arbitrary joint damage cases.",arxiv

soft or continuum robots are higher complicated. Moreover, recent reinforcement
learning methods are data-inefficient and can not be directly deployed to the
robot without simulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient reinforcement

robots are becoming ever more capable. There is also an increasing demand from
end-users for autonomous service robots that can operate in real environments

control algorithms, with the aim for a robot to self-learn useful feature
representations from unstructured sensory input leading to the optimal
actuation policy. In addition to sensors mounted on the robot, sensors might
also be deployed in the environment, although these might need to be accessed
via an unreliable wireless connection. In this paper, we demonstrate deep

(e.g., legged robots) from being confidently deployed in real-world situations
(e.g., post-disaster rescue). Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures,
robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their
tasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement
Learning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the
robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode,
that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL
methods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking
robots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a
solution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel
learning algorithm called ""Reset-free Trial-and-Error"" (RTE) that (1) breaks
the complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics
simulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover
from damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into
account. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated
six-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in
several ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and
whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments
show that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an
environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention.",arxiv

services via networks to access unlimited computation power, at the cost of

a heartbeat signal, we combine cloud robotics with a smart edge device to build
a Fog Robotic system. We use the system to enable robust teleoperation of a
dynamic self-balancing robot from the cloud. We first use the system to pick up
boxes from static locations, a task commonly performed in warehouse logistics.
To make cloud teleoperation more efficient, we deploy image based visual
servoing (IBVS) to perform box pickups automatically. Visual feedbacks,
including apriltag recognition and tracking, are performed in the cloud to
emulate a Fog Robotic object recognition system for IBVS. We demonstrate the
feasibility of real-time dynamic automation system using this cloud-edge

mobile robot navigation with dynamic obstacles avoidance. Using experience
collected in a simulation environment, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is
trained to predict proper steering actions of a robot from its egocentric local

trained neural network is then transferred and executed on a real-world mobile
robot to guide its local path planning. The new approach is evaluated both

  in indoor environments","Deep Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied in various computer
games [8]. However, it is still rarely used in real-world applications,
especially for the navigation and continuous control of real mobile robots
[13]. Previous approaches lack safety and robustness and/or need a structured
environment. In this paper we present our proof of concept for autonomous
self-learning robot navigation in an unknown environment for a real robot
without a map or planner. The input for the robot is only the fused data from a
2D laser scanner and a RGB-D camera as well as the orientation to the goal. The
map of the environment is unknown. The output actions of an Asynchronous
Advantage Actor-Critic network (GA3C) are the linear and angular velocities for
the robot. The navigator/controller network is pretrained in a high-speed,
parallel, and self-implemented simulation environment to speed up the learning
process and then deployed to the real robot. To avoid overfitting, we train
relatively small networks, and we add random Gaussian noise to the input laser
data. The sensor data fusion with the RGB-D camera allows the robot to navigate
in real environments with real 3D obstacle avoidance and without the need to
fit the environment to the sensory capabilities of the robot. To further
increase the robustness, we train on environments of varying difficulties and

  multi-agent human-robot collaborative learning","Learning from Demonstration (LfD) constitutes one of the most robust
methodologies for constructing efficient cognitive robotic systems. Despite the
large body of research works already reported, current key technological
challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy.
Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD
robotic learning is introduced, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of
open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex
environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the
recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, by establishing a
Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human
multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental
conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes
(implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a
network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the
aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the
network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot
interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive
architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the
conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent
operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic
schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates
the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled
