This paper proposes the using of algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) in the control layer of an autonomous vehicle. More specifically, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are implemented in order to compare results between them. The aim of this work is to obtain a trained model, applying a DRL algorithm, able of sending control commands to the vehicle to navigate properly and efficiently following a determined route. In addition, for each of the algorithms, several agents are presented as a solution, so that each of these agents uses different data sources to achieve the vehicle control commands. For this purpose, an open-source simulator such as CARLA is used, providing to the system with the ability to perform a multitude of tests without any risk into an hyper-realistic urban simulation environment, something that is unthinkable in the real world. The results obtained show that both DQN and DDPG reach the goal, but DDPG obtains a better performance. DDPG perfoms trajectories very similar to classic controller as LQR. In both cases RMSE is lower than 0.1m following trajectories with a range 180-700m. To conclude, some conclusions and future works are commented.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-021-11437-3,springer,1
