National Achievement Survey (NAS) has surveyed and reported in many States of India consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, language and science from class III to class VIII studying in the government school system. Smart Villages is only possible if the literacy level and infrastructure improves considerably. This paper aims to perform a reality check of the situation by comparing different rural areas of various countries including India and study of related work done. The paper proposes a Robust Model for Rural Education by developing an intelligent humanoid robot using the Deep Learning approach, Human recognition, Object Recognition and Speech Recognition. The data set consists of Primary and Secondary Student data of around 10,000 Students (5 years) from 5 villages. The Proposed Model would be compared with existing models on the parameters of Learnability, Decision making, Flexibility and Cost-effectiveness. The implementation of this Model will help in decreasing the drop out rate, evaluate Students and give them a Learning platform based on their characteristics, increase adaptive and self paced learning. This Model can also be executed for Rural Adult Education and Skill building so that the Smart Village concept can become a reality.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-85365-5_17,springer,1

In this context, the application of AI algorithms in endoscopy is gaining increasing attention so that modern endoscopy is moving towards more and more assisted/automatic solutions. Several approaches have been carried out in order to improve accuracy in diagnosis and surgical procedures. In this chapter, a general overview of the main contributions in the field is surveyed. Four main categories of applications were identified, namely, (i) detection and diagnosis during endoscopic procedure, (ii) informative frame selection, (iii) mosaicking and surface reconstruction, (iv) augmented reality systems for intraoperative assistance and surgeon training. Discussions on future research directions and implementation in clinical practice are provided.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-64573-1_164,springer,2
Article,doi:10.1007/s00530-021-00881-8,An object detection-based few-shot learning approach for multimedia quality assessment,Multimedia Systems,10.1007/s00530-021-00881-8,Springer,2022-01-29,2022-01-29,"A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at $$\text{mAP}_{0.5}$$ mAP 0.5 and $$\text{mAP}_{[0.50:0.95]}$$ mAP [ 0.50 : 0.95 ] , respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few-shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00530-021-00881-8,springer,3
Article,doi:10.1007/s00371-021-02347-4,A detailed analysis of image and video forgery detection techniques,The Visual Computer,10.1007/s00371-021-02347-4,Springer,2022-01-13,2022-01-13,"With the recent advancement in modern technology, one can easily manipulate a digital image or video using computer software or a mobile application. The purpose of editing visual media could be as simple as to look good before sharing to the social networking site’s or can be as malicious as to defame or hurt one’s reputation in the real world through such morphed visual imagery. Identity theft is one of the examples where one’s identity get stolen by some impersonator who can access the personal and financial information of an innocent person. To avoid such drastic situations, law enforcement authorities must use some automatic tools and techniques to find out whether a person is innocent or the culprit. One major question that arises here is how and what parts of visual imagery can be manipulated or edited. The answer to this question is important to distinguish the authentic images/videos from the doctored multimedia. This survey provides a detailed analysis of image and video manipulation types, popular visual imagery manipulation methods, and state-of-the-art image and video forgery detection techniques. It also surveys different fake image and video datasets used in tampering. The goal is to develop a sense of privacy and security in the research community. Finally, it focuses to motivate researchers to develop generalized methods to capture artificial visual imagery which is capable of detecting any type of manipulation in given visual imagery.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00371-021-02347-4,springer,4

This mode of exam has been even more prevalent and a necessity in the event of a forced closure of face-to-face teaching such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Naturally, conducting online exams poses much greater challenge to preserving academic integrity compared to conducting on-site face-to-face exams. As there is no human proctor for policing the examinee on site, the chances of cheating are high. Various online exam proctoring tools are being used by educational institutes worldwide, which offer different solutions to reduce the chances of cheating. The most common technique followed by these tools is recording of video and audio of the examinee during the whole duration of exam. These videos can be analyzed later by human examiner to detect possible cheating case. However, viewing hours of exam videos for each student can be impractical for a large class and thus detecting cheating would be next to impossible. Although some AI-based tools are being used by some proctoring software to raise flags, they are not always very useful. In this paper we propose a cheating detection technique that analyzes an exam video to extract four types of event data, which are then fed to a pre-trained classification model for detecting cheating activity. We formulate the cheating detection problem as a multivariate time-series classification problem by transforming each video into a multivariate time-series representing the time-varying event data extracted from each frame of the video. We have developed a real dataset of cheating videos and conduct extensive experiments with varying video lengths, different deep learning and traditional machine learning models and feature sets, achieving prediction accuracy as high as 97.7%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-95405-5_9,springer,2

This survey can be an eye-opener for researchers as its diverse applications of HDNNs in present scenario shows an intelligent way to mimic human brain without creating a complex neuronal architecture having large number of layers. HDNN’s urgency is evident because in science many quantities are measured not by single values for each of them but a group of values defines 1 single unit as: signal has two values: amplitude and phase. The deficiency in present literature on the questions allied with HDNN application looks like sluggish down research focal point and growth in the area. Hence, there exists a call for state-of-the-art addressing high-dimensional problems in neural networks. The study equips readers with a lucid acquaintance of the existing and novel inclination in HDNN replicas. A lot of applications of HDNNs in various disciplines like: healthcare, climate, security, speech recognition, computer vision, music signal processing, production, stock, science, etc. are covered here to confirm advancement in HDNNs. Study divulges that HDNNs is prevalently known as: CVNN, QVNN, 3D VVNN, and OVNN. This paper also reveals that HDNNs have outperformed real valued neural networks in terms of resource utilization, training data set requirement, and accuracy of results. To see a comparative picture of significance and possible implementation of different HDNNs few charts are provided. A motivational message and suggestions for future researches in this area of High-Dimensionality will conclude this paper.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-5689-7_12,springer,3
