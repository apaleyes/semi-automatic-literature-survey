environment and human population, and can be facilitated by the use of unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAV), equipped with camera sensors that produce aerial photos
of the areas of interest. A modern technique for recognition of events based on
aerial photos is deep learning. In this paper, we present the state of the art
work related to the use of deep learning techniques for disaster
identification. We demonstrate the potential of this technique in identifying
disasters with high accuracy, by means of a relatively simple deep learning
model. Based on a dataset of 544 images (containing disaster images such as
fires, earthquakes, collapsed buildings, tsunami and flooding, as well as
non-disaster scenes), our results show an accuracy of 91% achieved, indicating
that deep learning, combined with UAV equipped with camera sensors, have the
potential to predict disasters with high accuracy.",arxiv

road intersections, where effective communication among vehicles is
challenging. UAVs may serve as relays with the advantages of low price, easy

a UAV-assisted vehicular network where the UAV jointly adjusts its transmission
control (power and channel) and 3D flight to maximize the total throughput.
First, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem by modeling the
mobility of the UAV/vehicles and the state transitions. Secondly, we solve the
target problem using a deep reinforcement learning method under unknown or
unmeasurable environment variables especially in 5G, namely, the deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and propose three solutions with
different control objectives. Environment variables are unknown and
unmeasurable, therefore, we use a deep reinforcement learning method. Moreover,
considering the energy consumption of 3D flight, we extend the proposed
solutions to maximize the total throughput per energy unit by encouraging or
discouraging the UAV's mobility. To achieve this goal, the DDPG framework is
modified. Thirdly, in a simplified model with small state space and action

novel approaches for SAUVs to perform three-dimensional (3D)
multi-sound-sources localization (MSSL) using only the inter-channel time

  Autonomous Cars","Autonomous terrestrial vehicles must be capable of perceiving traffic lights
and recognizing their current states to share the streets with human drivers.
Most of the time, human drivers can easily identify the relevant traffic
lights. To deal with this issue, a common solution for autonomous cars is to
integrate recognition with prior maps. However, additional solution is required
for the detection and recognition of the traffic light. Deep learning
techniques have showed great performance and power of generalization including
traffic related problems. Motivated by the advances in deep learning, some
recent works leveraged some state-of-the-art deep detectors to locate (and
further recognize) traffic lights from 2D camera images. However, none of them
combine the power of the deep learning-based detectors with prior maps to
recognize the state of the relevant traffic lights. Based on that, this work
proposes to integrate the power of deep learning-based detection with the prior
maps used by our car platform IARA (acronym for Intelligent Autonomous Robotic
Automobile) to recognize the relevant traffic lights of predefined routes. The
process is divided in two phases: an offline phase for map construction and
traffic lights annotation; and an online phase for traffic light recognition
and identification of the relevant ones. The proposed system was evaluated on
five test cases (routes) in the city of Vit\'oria, each case being composed of
a video sequence and a prior map with the relevant traffic lights for the
route. Results showed that the proposed technique is able to correctly identify
the relevant traffic light along the trajectory.",arxiv

Neural Networks (DNN). We distinguish two general modes of testing for DNNs:
Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test
datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing
where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop
mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify
two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from
real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be
used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely
confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications
can be time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the
following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing

substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do
online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though
these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them

important to characterize the scenarios that are most likely to result in

most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous
work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure
scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a
discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems.
First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing
the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation
complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance
of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver
for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational
complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar
initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a
recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a
continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection
of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial

Satelite System (GNSS) provides satellite-based PNT services. However, a
spoofer can temper an authentic GNSS signal and could transmit wrong position
information to an AV. Therefore, a GNSS must have the capability of real-time
detection and feedback-correction of spoofing attacks related to PNT receivers,
whereby it will help the end-user (autonomous vehicle in this case) to navigate
safely if it falls into any compromises. This paper aims to develop a deep
reinforcement learning (RL)-based turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection using
low-cost in-vehicle sensor data. We have utilized Honda Driving Dataset to
create attack and non-attack datasets, develop a deep RL model, and evaluate
the performance of the RL-based attack detection model. We find that the
accuracy of the RL model ranges from 99.99% to 100%, and the recall value is
100%. However, the precision ranges from 93.44% to 100%, and the f1 score
ranges from 96.61% to 100%. Overall, the analyses reveal that the RL model is
effective in turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection.",arxiv

  Vehicle Systems","To operate effectively in tomorrow's smart cities, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
must rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as camera and radar as well as
inter-vehicle communication. Such dependence on sensors and communication links
exposes AVs to cyber-physical (CP) attacks by adversaries that seek to take
control of the AVs by manipulating their data. Thus, to ensure safe and optimal
AV dynamics control, the data processing functions at AVs must be robust to
such CP attacks. To this end, in this paper, the state estimation process for
monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel
adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize
the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and
the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In
the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor
readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and
potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the
roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the
deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions.
Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the
infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, the outcome of the
players' past interactions are fed to long-short term memory (LSTM) blocks.
Each player's LSTM block learns the expected spacing deviation resulting from
its own action and feeds it to its RL algorithm. Then, the the attacker's RL
algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the
AV's RL algorithm tries to find the optimal action that minimizes such

their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful
for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously
coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct
comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed,

a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected
through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in
the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use
the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In
addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the
performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual

demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the
appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected
that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and

  Violations of Autonomous Vehicles","Self-driving cars and trucks, autonomous vehicles (AVs), should not be
accepted by regulatory bodies and the public until they have much higher
confidence in their safety and reliability -- which can most practically and
convincingly be achieved by testing. But existing testing methods are
inadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of AV controllers against
complex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple
independent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While
test-driving AVs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events,
existing simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and
do not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated
awareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new
fuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used AV
simulators' API grammars. to generate semantically and temporally valid complex
driving scenarios (sequences of scenes). AutoFuzz is guided by a constrained
Neural Network (NN) evolutionary search over the API grammar to generate
scenarios seeking to find unique traffic violations. Evaluation of our
prototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller and two rule-based

successfully reduced the traffic violations found in the new version of the AV

continuous action spaces.
  In this paper, we propose ABS via Deep learning (ABS-DL). It is first
validated in a simulation environment on an aerial and ground coordination
scenario, where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is required to maintain three
Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) within a field of view of the UAV 's camera
(FoV). Moving a machine learning algorithm from a simulation environment to an
actual physical platform is challenging because `mistakes' made by the
algorithm while learning could lead to the damage of the platform. We then take
this extra step to test the algorithm in a physical environment. We propose a
safety-net as a protection layer to ensure that the autonomy of the algorithm
in learning does not compromise the safety of the platform. The tests of ABS-DL
in the real environment can guarantee a damage-free, collision avoidance
behaviour of autonomous bodies. The results show that performance of the
proposed approach is comparable to that of a human, and competitive to the
traditional approach using expert demonstrations performed on the composite
task. The proposed safety-net approach demonstrates its advantages when it
enables the UAV to operate more safely under the control of the ABS-DL
algorithm.",arxiv

perception systems for autonomous vehicles, which require trained networks to
perform safely in novel scenarios. It is challenging to verify neural networks
because their decisions are not explainable, they cannot be exhaustively
tested, and finite test samples cannot capture the variation across all
operating conditions. Existing work seeks to train models robust to new
scenarios via domain adaptation, style transfer, or few-shot learning. But
these techniques fail to predict how a trained model will perform when the
operating conditions differ from the testing conditions. We propose a metric,
Machine Learning (ML) Dependability, that measures the network's probability of
success in specified operating conditions which need not be the testing
conditions. In addition, we propose the metrics Task Undependability and
Harmful Undependability to distinguish network failures by their consequences.
We evaluate the performance of a Neural Network agent trained using
Reinforcement Learning in a simulated robot manipulation task. Our results
demonstrate that we can accurately predict the ML Dependability, Task
Undependability, and Harmful Undependability for operating conditions that are
significantly different from the testing conditions. Finally, we design a
Safety Function, using harmful failures identified during testing, that reduces
harmful failures, in one example, by a factor of 700 while maintaining a high

decoupled perception-planning-action operations, either based on End2End or
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. Current deep learning solutions for
autonomous driving are subject to several limitations (e.g. they estimate
driving actions through a direct mapping of sensors to actuators, or require
complex reward shaping methods). Although the cost function used for training
can aggregate multiple weighted objectives, the gradient descent step is
computed by the backpropagation algorithm using a single-objective loss. To
address these issues, we introduce NeuroTrajectory, which is a multi-objective
neuroevolutionary approach to local state trajectory learning for autonomous
driving, where the desired state trajectory of the ego-vehicle is estimated
over a finite prediction horizon by a perception-planning deep neural network.
In comparison to DRL methods, which predict optimal actions for the upcoming
sampling time, we estimate a sequence of optimal states that can be used for
motion control. We propose an approach which uses genetic algorithms for
training a population of deep neural networks, where each network individual is
evaluated based on a multi-objective fitness vector, with the purpose of
establishing a so-called Pareto front of optimal deep neural networks. The
performance of an individual is given by a fitness vector composed of three
elements. Each element describes the vehicle's travel path, lateral velocity
and longitudinal speed, respectively. The same network structure can be trained
on synthetic, as well as on real-world data sequences. We have benchmarked our
system against a baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as well as against an
End2End supervised learning method.",arxiv

Therefore, we propose to develop an ""Artificial Intelligence (AI)

the communications problem for three types of flash crowds, such as in

Artificial intelligence can solve these problems by analyzing the collected

Base Station (UAV-BS) is determined by optimization algorithms, which have high
computationally complexities and place heavy demands on UAV resources. In this
paper, we show that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model can be trained
to infer the location of a UAV-BS in real time. In so doing, we create a
framework to determine the UAV locations that considers the deployment of
Mobile Users (MUs) to generate labels by using the data obtained from an
optimization algorithm. Performance evaluations reveal that once the CNN model
is trained with the given labels and locations of MUs, the proposed approach is
capable of approximating the results given by the adopted optimization
algorithm with high fidelity, outperforming Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based
approaches. We also explore future research challenges and highlight key

how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle
deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the
performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a
joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the
convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during
convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system.
Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis

productivity but above all the quality of production while significantly
reducing the use of inputs. Meeting this goal is a real scientific and
technological challenge. Smart farming is among the promising approaches that
can lead to interesting solutions for vineyard management and reduce the

This is needed today more than ever, as the use of pesticides is coming under
increasing scrutiny and control. The goal is to map diseased areas in the
vineyard for fast and precise treatment, thus guaranteeing the maintenance of a
healthy state of the vine which is very important for yield management. To
tackle this problem, a method is proposed here for vine disease detection using
a deep learning segmentation approach on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images.
The method is based on the combination of the visible and infrared images
obtained from two different sensors. A new image registration method was
developed to align visible and infrared images, enabling fusion of the
information from the two sensors. A fully convolutional neural network approach
uses this information to classify each pixel according to different instances,

freely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some

rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by
intra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper

UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and

uncertainties. The uncertainties can come either from sensor limitations such
as occlusions and limited sensor range, or from probabilistic prediction of
other road participants, or from unknown social behavior in a new area. To
safely and efficiently drive in the presence of these uncertainties, the
decision-making and planning modules of autonomous cars should intelligently
utilize all available information and appropriately tackle the uncertainties so
that proper driving strategies can be generated. In this paper, we propose a
social perception scheme which treats all road participants as distributed
sensors in a sensor network. By observing the individual behaviors as well as
the group behaviors, uncertainties of the three types can be updated uniformly
in a belief space. The updated beliefs from the social perception are then
explicitly incorporated into a probabilistic planning framework based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC). The cost function of the MPC is learned via inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL). Such an integrated probabilistic planning module
with socially enhanced perception enables the autonomous vehicles to generate
behaviors which are defensive but not overly conservative, and socially
compatible. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified in
simulation on an representative scenario with sensor occlusions.",arxiv

  Delivery Network: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","With the stringent requirement of receiving video from unmanned aerial

the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to
spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically schedule the
video and cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with
overlapped video requests. By decomposition the problem into scheduling and
association sub-problems, we first introduce the conventional
non-learning-based scheduling and association algorithms, and a centralized
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) association approach based on the rainbow
agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from
observation. To reduce its complexity, we then decompose the association
problem into multiple sub-problems, resulting in a networked-distributed
Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we
propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm. To jointly solve the coupled
association and scheduling problems, we further develop a hierarchical
federated DRL algorithm with scheduler as meta-controller, and association as
the controller. Our simulation results shown that our CF-MB network can
effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users. Our
proposed learning architectures is effective and scalable for a

summed together into an empty canvas of the same resolution as the image and
one new image is produced. Third, this new image is compared with the original

Finally, a k-means algorithm is applied to eliminate the noise and to extract
the accurate wilt from it. Moreover, the extracted wilt is mapped on the

algorithms detects the wilt appropriately, which surpasses the traditional

such applications, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has considered
the adoption of terrestrial cellular networks to support UAV sensing services,
also known as the cellular Internet of UAVs. In this paper, we consider a
cellular Internet of UAVs, where the sensory data can be transmitted either to
base station (BS) via cellular links, or to mobile devices by underlay
UAV-to-Device (U2D) communications. To evaluate the freshness of data, the age
of information (AoI) is adopted, in which a lower AoI implies fresher data.
Since UAVs' AoIs are determined by their trajectories during sensing and
transmission, we investigate the AoI minimization problem for UAVs by designing
their trajectories. This problem is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with an
infinite state-action space, and thus we utilize multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to approximate the state-action space. Then, we propose a
multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results
show that our algorithm achieves a lower AoI than greedy algorithm and policy
gradient algorithm.",arxiv

  Using Deep Reinforcement Learning","Many of the devices used in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications are

propose a simultaneous wireless power transfer and information transmission
scheme for IoT devices with support from reconfigurable intelligent surface

devices through information transmission. To characterise the agility of the
UAV, we consider two scenarios: a hovering UAV and a mobile UAV. Aiming at
maximizing the total network sum-rate, we jointly optimize the trajectory of
the UAV, the energy harvesting scheduling of IoT devices, and the phaseshift

reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the optimization problem of
maximizing the total network sum-rate. Numerical results illustrate the
effectiveness of the UAV's flying path optimization and the network's

Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV control framework

actor-critic based DRL, is exploited. Furthermore, to promote the learning
exploration around the timing of the change, the original DDPG is adapted into
an asynchronous parallel computing (APC) structure which leads to a better

  Networks","Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high
data-rate requirements of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as
the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking
is very challenging because of the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and attitude
variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose
to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which
enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic
UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are
three-fold. 1) A new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the
CA-enabled UAV mmWave network. 2) A specialized hierarchical codebook is
constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered
cylindrical conformal array (CCA), which contains both the angular beam pattern
and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA. 3) A
codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian
process machine learning enabled UAV position/attitude predication is developed
to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error
aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV

applications, reliable link acquisition for serving UAVs is required.
Considering the dynamic characteristics of UAV, it is hugely challenging to
persist a reliable link without beam misalignment. In this paper, we propose a
flight sensor data and beamforming signal based integrated UAV tracking scheme
to deal with this problem. The proposed scheme provides a compatible integrated
system considering the practical specification of the flight sensor data and
the beamforming pilot signal. The UAV position tracking is comprised of two
steps: 1) UAV position prediction by the flight sensor data and 2) position
update with the beamforming signal using Gaussian process regression (GPR)
method, which is a nonparametric machine learning. The flight sensor data can
assist ground station (GS) or UAV nodes in designing the precoding and the
receive beamforming matrix with drastically reduced overheads. The beamforming
signal can accomplish high beamforming gain to be maintained even when the
flight sensor data is absent. Therefore, the proposed scheme can support the
moving target continuously by utilizing these two signals. The simulation
results are provided to confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms other
conventional beam tracking schemes. We also derive 3-dimensional (3D)

of experiments and line search is used to identify the minimum detection range

Effective and efficient detection of such failure may provide early warning to

includes very low resolution of the objects, MPEG artifacts due to compression
and a large searching area with many hard negatives. Tracking is equally
difficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion
estimation. Luckily, we found that by combining this two challenging tasks
together, there will be mutual benefits. Following the idea, in this paper, we
present a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network,
where detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame
representation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The
framework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning
informative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation
is shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with
datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds

  Tracking Under Wind Disturbances and In-Flight Dynamics Changes","The demand for accurate and fast trajectory tracking for multirotor Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics
technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is
required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios
like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes.
In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on
identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks
with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a
linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback
linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of
different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the
non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between
performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for
the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We
demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of
experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite
significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application
of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to
obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is
beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based

In this paper, we propose two decoupled dynamic model based Extended Kalman

Neural Network and Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) framework, without
requiring any prior knowledge of the UAV physical parameters. The designed
filters with real-time identified process model parameters are tested
experimentally and showed two advantages. Firstly, smooth and lag-free
estimates of the UAV rotational speed and inertial acceleration are obtained,
and used to improve the closed loop system performance, reducing the controller
action by over 6 %. Secondly, the proposed approach enabled the UAV to track

performance changes due to the use of slower vision sensors, or due to the
integration of accelerometer measurements. Experimental identification results
were closely matching simulation results, which can be used to explain system
behaviour and anticipate the closed loop performance limits given a certain

security and safety risks to the public as UAVs are now used for cybercrimes.
To mitigate these risks, it is important to have a system that can detect or
identify the presence of an intruding UAV in a restricted environment. In this
work, we propose a radio frequency (RF) based UAV detection and identification
system by exploiting signals emanating from both the UAV and its flight
controller, respectively. While several RF devices (i.e., Bluetooth and WiFi
devices) operate in the same frequency band as UAVs, the proposed framework
utilizes a semi-supervised learning approach for the detection of UAV or UAV's
control signals in the presence of other wireless signals such as Bluetooth and
WiFi. The semi-supervised learning approach uses stacked denoising autoencoder
and local outlier factor algorithms. After the detection of UAV or UAV's
control signals, the signal is decomposed by using Hilbert-Huang transform and
wavelet packet transform to extract features from the time-frequency-energy
domain of the signal. The extracted feature sets are used to train a
three-level hierarchical classifier for identifying the type of signals (i.e.,

grounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an
overarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs
system-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to
system integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework
inspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular,
it is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a
relatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to
perception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based
solutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory
scene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is
presented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT,
but which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a

not accurately capture the mechanism by which deep neural networks work. Double
descent indicates that deep neural networks typically operate by smoothly
interpolating between data points rather than by extracting a few high level

for both the decision and explanation. For this approach to work, it is
important that the explanation actually be related to the decision, ideally
capturing the mechanism used to arrive at the explanation. Finally, we argue it

  Federated Learning in UAV-Enabled Internet of Vehicles","Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components
such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the
increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a
promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that
can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from
the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when
continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose
the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the
communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving
the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources
to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we
present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation
of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition
formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the
UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a
stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to
solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take
into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The
simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single
coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the
UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases,
the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any
coalition.",arxiv

  Systems","Advances in Machine Learning (ML) have led to its adoption as an integral
component in many applications, including banking, medical diagnosis, and
driverless cars. To further broaden the use of ML models, cloud-based services
offered by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others have developed ML-as-a-service
tools as black-box systems. However, ML classifiers are vulnerable to
adversarial examples: inputs that are maliciously modified can cause the
classifier to provide adversary-desired outputs. Moreover, it is known that
adversarial examples generated on one classifier are likely to cause another
classifier to make the same mistake, even if the classifiers have different
architectures or are trained on disjoint datasets. This property, which is
known as transferability, opens up the possibility of attacking black-box
systems by generating adversarial examples on a substitute classifier and
transferring the examples to the target classifier. Therefore, the key to
protect black-box learning systems against the adversarial examples is to block
their transferability. To this end, we propose a training method that, as the
input is more perturbed, the classifier smoothly outputs lower confidence on
the original label and instead predicts that the input is ""invalid"". In
essence, we augment the output class set with a NULL label and train the
classifier to reject the adversarial examples by classifying them as NULL. In
experiments, we apply a wide range of attacks based on adversarial examples on
the black-box systems. We show that a classifier trained with the proposed
method effectively resists against the adversarial examples, while maintaining
the accuracy on clean data.",arxiv

all over the agricultural field. This practice involves significant waste and
cost of herbicide for farmers and environmental pollution. One way to reduce
the cost and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide
at the right place and at the right time (Precision Agriculture). Nowadays,
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is becoming an interesting acquisition system for
weeds localization and management due to its ability to obtain the images of
the entire agricultural field with a very high spatial resolution and at low
cost. Despite the important advances in UAV acquisition systems, automatic
weeds detection remains a challenging problem because of its strong similarity
with the crops. Recently Deep Learning approach has shown impressive results in
different complex classification problem. However, this approach needs a
certain amount of training data but, creating large agricultural datasets with
pixel-level annotations by expert is an extremely time consuming task. In this
paper, we propose a novel fully automatic learning method using Convolutional
Neuronal Networks (CNNs) with unsupervised training dataset collection for
weeds detection from UAV images. The proposed method consists in three main
phases. First we automatically detect the crop lines and using them to identify
the interline weeds. In the second phase, interline weeds are used to
constitute the training dataset. Finally, we performed CNNs on this dataset to
build a model able to detect the crop and weeds in the images. The results
obtained are comparable to the traditional supervised training data labeling.

of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless
communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links
suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic
environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the
optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art
approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they
work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have
limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for
air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a
state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the
characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key
observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according
to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In
this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the
on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a
learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state to
dynamically store temporal features under variable flight states. We also
present an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that
adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement
our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various

robotics and wireless communications. For instance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) require the information of the position precisely for an adequate
control strategy. This problem is handled very efficiently with integrated GPS
units for outdoor applications. However, indoor applications require special
treatment due to the unavailability of GPS signals. Another aspect of mobile
robots such as UAVs is that there is constant wireless communication between
the mobile robot and a computational unit. This communication is mainly done
for obtaining telemetry information or computation of control actions directly.
The responsible integrated units for this transmission are commercial wireless
communication chipsets. These units on the receiver side are responsible for
getting rid of the diverse effects of the communication channel with various
mathematical techniques. These techniques mainly require the Channel State
Information (CSI) of the current channel to compensate the channel itself.
After the compensation, the chipset has nothing to do with CSI. However, the
locations of both the transmitter and receiver have a direct impact on CSI.
Even though CSI contains such rich information about the environment, the
accessibility of these data is blocked by the commercial wireless chipsets
since they are manufactured to provide only the processed information data bits
to the user. However, with the IEEE 802.11n standardization, certain chipsets
provide access to CSI. Therefore, CSI data became processible and integrable to
localization schemes. In this project, a test environment was constructed for
the localization task. Two routers with proper chipsets were assigned as

global demand for food. To identify crop varieties with high yield potential,
plant scientists and breeders evaluate the performance of hundreds of lines in
multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process of selecting
advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A
hyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect
aerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution. Aerial images were
captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield
fields composed of hundreds experimental plots (1x2.4 meter), each contained a
single wheat line. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by
a combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To leverage the high
spatial resolution and investigate the yield variation within the plots, images
of plots were divided into sub-plots by integrating image processing techniques
and spectral mixture analysis with the expert domain knowledge. Afterwards, the
sub-plot dataset was divided into train, validation, and test sets using
stratified sampling. Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep
neural networks were trained for yield estimation. The coefficient of
determination for predicting the yield of the test dataset at sub-plot scale
was 0.79 with root mean square error of 5.90 grams. In addition to providing
insights into yield variation at sub-plot scale, the proposed framework can
facilitate the process of high-throughput yield phenotyping as a valuable

conventional terrestrial communication systems, UAVs typically have rather
limited onboard energy on one hand, and require additional flying energy
consumption on the other hand, which renders energy-efficient UAV communication
with smart energy expenditure of paramount importance. In this paper, via
extensive flight experiments, we aim to firstly validate the recently derived
theoretical energy model for rotary-wing UAVs, and then develop a general model
for those complicated flight scenarios where rigorous theoretical model
derivation is quite challenging, if not impossible. Specifically, we first
investigate how UAV power consumption varies with its flying speed for the
simplest straight-and-level flight. With about 12,000 valid power-speed data
points collected, we first apply the model-based curve fitting to obtain the
modelling parameters based on the theoretical closed-form energy model in the
existing literature. In addition, in order to exclude the potential bias caused
by the theoretical energy model, the obtained measurement data is also trained
using a model-free deep neural network. It is found that the obtained curve
from both methods can match quite well with the theoretical energy model. Next,
we further extend the study to arbitrary 2-dimensional (2-D) flight, where, to
our best knowledge, no rigorous theoretical derivation is available for the
closed-form energy model as a function of its flying speed, direction, and
acceleration. To fill the gap, we first propose a heuristic energy model for

novel comprehensive approach, called DNN-MRFT, for real-time identification and

One of the notable advantages of DNN-MRFT is the exact estimation of identified

secondary contribution is a generalized controller based on DNN-MRFT that
takes-off a UAV with unknown dynamics and identifies the inner loops dynamics
in-flight. Using the developed framework, DNN-MRFT is sequentially applied to
the outer translational loops of the UAV utilizing in-flight results obtained
for the inner attitude loops. DNN-MRFT takes on average 15 seconds to get the

high-resolution imaging capabilities with low cost for mapping a relatively
large area of interest. These cutting-edge technologies have caught the US Army

importance of information extraction from the derived photogrammetric data to
create semantic-rich virtual environments (Chen et al., 2019). For example, an
increase of simulation realism and fidelity was achieved by segmenting and
replacing photogrammetric trees with game-ready tree models. In this work, we
further investigated the semantic information extraction problem and focused on
the ground material segmentation and object detection tasks. The main
innovation of this work was that we leveraged both the original 2D images and
the derived 3D photogrammetric data to overcome the challenges faced when using
each individual data source. For ground material segmentation, we utilized an
existing convolutional neural network architecture (i.e., 3DMV) which was
originally designed for segmenting RGB-D sensed indoor data. We improved its
performance for outdoor photogrammetric data by introducing a depth pooling
layer in the architecture to take into consideration the distance between the
source images and the reconstructed terrain model. To test the performance of
our improved 3DMV, a ground truth ground material database was created using

Specifically, we formulate a problem for maximization of the achievable rate

involves high-dimensional, highly coupled variable vectors, we first obtain the
conditional optimal position of the FD-UAV relay for maximization of an
approximate upper bound on the achievable rate in closed form, under the
assumption of a line-of-sight (LoS) environment and ideal beamforming. Then,
the UAV is deployed to the position which is closest to the conditional optimal
position and yields LoS paths for both air-to-ground links. Subsequently, we
propose an alternating interference suppression (AIS) algorithm for the joint
design of the beamforming vectors and the power control variables. In each
iteration, the beamforming vectors are optimized for maximization of the
beamforming gains of the target signals and the successive reduction of the
interference, where the optimal power control variables are obtained in closed

decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans.
Models that correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in
certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases
and in turn build better models. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how
and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. In this paper, we
present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the
dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an
image classification task. In particular, we seek to answer the following
questions: Which (well-performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in
their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty
affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans?
Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image
recognition more accurate? Our findings have important implications on

  Neural Networks","Deep learning algorithms have been shown to perform extremely well on many
classical machine learning problems. However, recent studies have shown that
deep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to
adversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to
provide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the
security of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating
consequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or
illegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems
can be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a
defensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness
of adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the
generalizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive
distillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of
our defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study
shows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation
from 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be
explained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial
sample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30. We also find that
distillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be
modified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we
tested.",arxiv

  Maps (Masters Thesis)","One of the most important parts of environment perception is the detection of
obstacles in the surrounding of the vehicle. To achieve that, several sensors
like radars, LiDARs and cameras are installed in autonomous vehicles. The
produced sensor data is fused to a general representation of the surrounding.
In this thesis the dynamic occupancy grid map approach of Nuss et al. is used
while three goals are achieved. First, the approach of Nuss et al. to
distinguish between moving and non-moving obstacles is improved by using Fully
Convolutional Neural Networks to create a class prediction for each grid cell.
For this purpose, the network is initialized with public pre-trained network
models and the training is executed with a semi-automatic generated dataset.
The second goal is to provide orientation information for each detected moving
obstacle. This could improve tracking algorithms, which are based on the
dynamic occupancy grid map. The orientation extraction based on the
Convolutional Neural Network shows a better performance in comparison to an
orientation extraction directly over the velocity information of the dynamic
occupancy grid map. A general problem of developing machine learning approaches
like Neural Networks is the number of labeled data, which can always be
increased. For this reason, the last goal is to evaluate a semi-supervised
learning algorithm, to generate automatically more labeled data. The result of
this evaluation shows that the automated labeled data does not improve the
performance of the Convolutional Neural Network. All in all, the best results
are combined to compare the detection against the approach of Nuss et al. [36]

remote intrusions onto the in-vehicle network has been manifested. In regard to
unmanned autonomous cars, limited work has been done to detect intrusions for
them while existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) embrace limitations
against strong adversaries. In this paper, we consider the very nature of
autonomous car and leverage the road context to build a novel IDS, named Road
context-aware IDS (RAIDS). When a computer-controlled car is driving through
continuous roads, road contexts and genuine frames transmitted on the car's
in-vehicle network should resemble a regular and intelligible pattern. RAIDS
hence employs a lightweight machine learning model to extract road contexts
from sensory information (e.g., camera images and distance sensor values) that
are used to generate control signals for maneuvering the car. With such ongoing
road context, RAIDS validates corresponding frames observed on the in-vehicle
network. Anomalous frames that substantially deviate from road context will be
discerned as intrusions. We have implemented a prototype of RAIDS with neural

  Urban Scenarios","Localization on 3D data is a challenging task for unmanned vehicles,
especially in long-term dynamic urban scenarios. Due to the generality and
long-term stability, the pole-like objects are very suitable as landmarks for
unmanned vehicle localization in time-varing scenarios. In this paper, a
long-term LiDAR-only localization algorithm based on semantic cluster map is
proposed. At first, the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used to infer the
semantics of LiDAR point clouds. Combined with the point cloud segmentation,
the long-term static objects pole/trunk in the scene are extracted and
registered into a semantic cluster map. When the unmanned vehicle re-enters the
environment again, the relocalization is completed by matching the clusters of
the local map with the clusters of the global map. Furthermore, the continuous
matching between the local and global maps stably outputs the global pose at
2Hz to correct the drift of the 3D LiDAR odometry. The proposed approach
realizes localization in the long-term scenarios without maintaining the

(GPS) infrastructure, albeit there is an increasing demand for alternative
methods for GPS-denied environments. One of them is known as place recognition,
which associates images of places with their corresponding positions. We
previously proposed systems based on Weightless Neural Networks (WNN) to
address this problem as a classification task. This encompasses solely one part
of the global localization, which is not precise enough for driverless cars.
Instead of just recognizing past places and outputting their poses, it is
desired that a global localization system estimates the pose of current place
images. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem as follows. Firstly,
given a live image, the place recognition system returns the most similar image
and its pose. Then, given live and recollected images, a visual localization
system outputs the relative camera pose represented by those images. To
estimate the relative camera pose between the recollected and the current
images, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the two images as
input and a relative pose vector as output. Together, these systems solve the
global localization problem using the topological and metric information to
approximate the current vehicle pose. The full approach is compared to a Real-
Time Kinematic GPS system and a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
system. Experimental results show that the proposed approach correctly

flexibility and performance; in addition, for real-time inference with low

However, the performance gain from the single-FPGA design is obstructed by the
limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we employ multiple FPGAs to
cooperatively run DNNs with the objective of achieving super-linear speed-up
against single-FPGA design. In implementing such systems, we found two barriers
that hinder us from achieving the design goal: (1) the lack of a clear
partition scheme for each DNN layer to fully exploit parallelism, and (2) the
insufficient bandwidth between the off-chip memory and the accelerator due to
the growing size of DNNs. To tackle these issues, we propose a general
framework, ""Super-LIP"", which can support different kinds of DNNs. In this
paper, we take Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a vehicle to illustrate
Super-LIP. We first formulate an accurate system-level model to support the
exploration of best partition schemes. Then, we develop a novel design
methodology to effectively alleviate the heavy loads on memory bandwidth by
moving traffic from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. We implement Super-LIP

  Autonomous Vehicles","It has been shown that most machine learning algorithms are susceptible to
adversarial perturbations. Slightly perturbing an image in a carefully chosen
direction in the image space may cause a trained neural network model to
misclassify it. Recently, it was shown that physical adversarial examples
exist: printing perturbed images then taking pictures of them would still
result in misclassification. This raises security and safety concerns.
  However, these experiments ignore a crucial property of physical objects: the
camera can view objects from different distances and at different angles. In
this paper, we show experiments that suggest that current constructions of
physical adversarial examples do not disrupt object detection from a moving
platform. Instead, a trained neural network classifies most of the pictures
taken from different distances and angles of a perturbed image correctly. We
believe this is because the adversarial property of the perturbation is
sensitive to the scale at which the perturbed picture is viewed, so (for
example) an autonomous car will misclassify a stop sign only from a small range
of distances.
  Our work raises an important question: can one construct examples that are
adversarial for many or most viewing conditions? If so, the construction should
offer very significant insights into the internal representation of patterns by
deep networks. If not, there is a good prospect that adversarial examples can

the performance of the CNN+RNN speech recognition model, otherwise some
parameter ranges of CNN can render it useless to add the CNN to the RNN model.
Our results show a strong dependency of word accuracy on the Number of Filters
of convolutional layers. Based on the experimental results, the paper suggests
a possible hypothesis of Sound-2-Vector Embedding (Convolutional Embedding) to
explain the above observations.
  Based on this Embedding hypothesis and the optimization of parameters, the
paper develops an End-to-End speech recognition system which has a high word
accuracy but also has a light model-weight. The developed LVCSR (Large
Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition) model has achieved quite a high word
accuracy of 90.2% only by its Acoustic Model alone, without any assistance from
intermediate phonetic representation and any Language Model. Its acoustic model
contains only 4.4 million weight parameters, compared to the 35~68 million
acoustic-model weight parameters in DeepSpeech2 [2] (one of the top
state-of-the-art LVCSR models) which can achieve a word accuracy of 91.5%. The
light-weighted model is good for improving the transcribing computing
efficiency and also useful for mobile devices, Driverless Vehicles, etc. Our
model weight is reduced to ~10% the size of DeepSpeech2, but our model accuracy
remains close to that of DeepSpeech2. If combined with a Language Model, our
LVCSR system is able to achieve 91.5% word accuracy.",arxiv

  Mitigation","The interest of the automotive industry has progressively focused on subjects
related to driver assistance systems as well as autonomous cars. Cars combine a
variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings robustly. Among them, radar
sensors are indispensable because of their independence of lighting conditions
and the possibility to directly measure velocity. However, radar interference
is an issue that becomes prevalent with the increasing amount of radar systems

FCNs that take spectrograms of the beat signals as input, and provide the
corresponding clean range profiles as output. We propose two architectures for
interference mitigation which outperform the classical zeroing technique.
Moreover, considering the lack of databases for this task, we release as open

the development of depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques. It has
attracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence,
navigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding
of point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the
informative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the
irregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert
point clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding
them into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization
artifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional
neural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on
spectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals
on graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial
approximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that
describes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the
corresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of
dynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss
function, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the
ShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
computational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state
of the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and
point cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to
point cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40

assesses the car's safety in scenarios where the car must avoid collision with
an adversary. Core to this mechanism is a safety measure, called Safe-Kamikaze
Distance (SKD), which computes the average similarity between sets of safe
adversary's trajectories and kamikaze trajectories close to the safe
trajectories. The kamikaze trajectories are generated based on planning under
uncertainty techniques, namely the Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes, to account for the partially observed car policy from the point of
view of the adversary. We found that SKD is inversely proportional to the upper
bound on the probability that a small deformation changes a collision-free
trajectory of the adversary into a colliding one. We perform systematic tests
on a scenario where the adversary is a pedestrian crossing a single-lane road

show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving
also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a

trustworthiness technologies from a security engineering perspective, which
covers all aspects of secure ML system development including threat modeling,
common offensive and defensive technologies, privacy-preserving machine

above and beyond a survey by describing a metamodel we created that represents
the body of knowledge in a standard and visualized way for ML practitioners. We
further illustrate how to leverage the metamodel to guide a systematic threat
analysis and security design process in a context of generic ML system
development, which extends and scales up the classic process. Thirdly, we
propose future research directions motivated by our findings to advance the
development of robust and trustworthy ML systems. Our work differs from

network-based policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This
vulnerability poses a potentially serious threat to safety-critical systems
such as autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism to
defend reinforcement learning agents from adversarial attacks by leveraging an
action-conditioned frame prediction module. Our core idea is that the
adversarial examples targeting at a neural network-based policy are not
effective for the frame prediction model. By comparing the action distribution
produced by a policy from processing the current observed frame to the action
distribution produced by the same policy from processing the predicted frame
from the action-conditioned frame prediction module, we can detect the presence
of adversarial examples. Beyond detecting the presence of adversarial examples,
our method allows the agent to continue performing the task using the predicted
frame when the agent is under attack. We evaluate the performance of our
algorithm using five games in Atari 2600. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed defense mechanism achieves favorable performance against baseline
algorithms in detecting adversarial examples and in earning rewards when the
agents are under attack.",arxiv

intelligence (AI) is able to drive towards a desired destination. Today, there
are different paradigms addressing the development of AI drivers. On the one
hand, we find modular pipelines, which divide the driving task into sub-tasks
such as perception and maneuver planning and control. On the other hand, we
find end-to-end driving approaches that try to learn a direct mapping from
input raw sensor data to vehicle control signals. The later are relatively less
studied, but are gaining popularity since they are less demanding in terms of
sensor data annotation. This paper focuses on end-to-end autonomous driving. So
far, most proposals relying on this paradigm assume RGB images as input sensor
data. However, AVs will not be equipped only with cameras, but also with active
sensors providing accurate depth information (e.g., LiDARs). Accordingly, this
paper analyses whether combining RGB and depth modalities, i.e. using RGBD
data, produces better end-to-end AI drivers than relying on a single modality.
We consider multimodality based on early, mid and late fusion schemes, both in
multisensory and single-sensor (monocular depth estimation) settings. Using the

they possess heterogeneous properties and everyone can enter and leave the

infeasible to incorporate potentially infinite scenarios with one unified

LiDAR point clouds, without the use of classic map--localize--plan approaches.
However, existing methods are limited by their reliance on cameras and LiDAR

control, according to which humans should execute a certain significant level
of judgment over AS. While in the military sector there is a fear that AS could
mean that humans lose control over life and death decisions, in the

autonomy could bring significant operational benefits by removing the need for

of these applications. We then consider the GPU architecture in the development
of a precise timing model for the GPU kernels and leverage a technique known as
persistent threads to implement fine-grained kernel scheduling with improved
performance through interleaved execution. Next, we propose a general method
for scheduling parallel GPU applications in real time. Finally, to schedule
multiple parallel GPU applications, we propose a practical real-time scheduling
algorithm based on federated scheduling and grid search (for GPU kernel
segments) with uniprocessor fixed priority scheduling (for multiple CPU and

examples, inputs that look normal but cause an incorrect classification by the
deep neural network. For example, the proposed threat could result in
hand-written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking
normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which
adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal
image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the
transformations that normally occur in acquiring the image in a real world
application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or
using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the
effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples,
resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just
acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security
threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over
multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing,
such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples.
This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification,
adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat.",arxiv

However, most of them fail, if data with unknown disturbances occur, and their
performance decrease enormously. One possibility to still obtain reliable
results is to observe the environment with different sensor types, such as
camera and lidar, and to fuse the sensor data by means of neural networks,
since different sensors behave differently in diverse weather conditions.
Hence, the sensors can complement each other by means of an appropriate sensor
data fusion. Nevertheless, the fusion-based approaches are still susceptible to
disturbances and fail to classify disturbed image areas correctly. This problem
can be solved by means of a special training method, the so called Robust
Learning Method (RLM), a method by which the neural network learns to handle
unknown noise. In this work, two different sensor fusion architectures for

  Data","Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly applied to decision-making
and control problems in Cyber-Physical Systems among which many are
safety-critical, e.g., chemical plants, robotics, autonomous vehicles. Despite
the significant benefits brought by ML techniques, they also raise additional
safety issues because 1) most expressive and powerful ML models are not
transparent and behave as a black box and 2) the training data which plays a
crucial role in ML safety is usually incomplete. An important technique to
achieve safety for ML models is ""Safe Fail"", i.e., a model selects a reject
option and applies the backup solution, a traditional controller or a human
operator for example, when it has low confidence in a prediction.
  Data-driven models produced by ML algorithms learn from training data, and
hence they are only as good as the examples they have learnt. As pointed in
[17], ML models work well in the ""training space"" (i.e., feature space with
sufficient training data), but they could not extrapolate beyond the training
space. As observed in many previous studies, a feature space that lacks
training data generally has a much higher error rate than the one that contains
sufficient training samples [31]. Therefore, it is essential to identify the
training space and avoid extrapolating beyond the training space. In this
paper, we propose an efficient Feature Space Partitioning Tree (FSPT) to
address this problem. Using experiments, we also show that, a strong
relationship exists between model performance and FSPT score.",arxiv

exclusively focused on a single sensing modality, especially video. However, in
safety critical applications it is imperative to utilize multiple sensor
modalities for robust operation. To exploit the benefits of state-of-the-art

applications and autonomous vehicles. This multimodal dataset is the first of
its kind to be made openly available and can be exploited for many applications

intelligent mobility. We propose a novel data preprocessing algorithm to enable
adaptive feature extraction from the dataset to be utilized by different

fully explore the environment. However, reinforcement learning (RL) and

low-level policies learned by IL for discrete driving modes, and a high-level
policy learned by RL that switches between different driving modes. Our
approach exploits the advantages of both IL and RL by integrating them into a

then develop an agent with a modular architecture that can interpret and adhere
to such textual constraints while learning new tasks. Our model consists of (1)
a constraint interpreter that encodes textual constraints into spatial and

uses these representations to produce a policy achieving minimal constraint
violations during training. Across different domains in HazardWorld, we show
that our method achieves higher rewards (up to11x) and fewer constraint

therefore be a powerful tool to enable training. Due to slightly different
observations, agents trained and evaluated solely in simulation often perform
well there but have difficulties in real-world environments. To tackle this

However, RL methods often fail to generalize to safety-critical scenarios since

adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was proposed to train an adversarial
network that applies disturbances to a system, which improves robustness in
test scenarios. A drawback of neural-network-based adversaries is that
integrating system requirements without handcrafting sophisticated reward
signals is difficult. Safety falsification methods allow one to find a set of
initial conditions as well as an input sequence, such that the system violates
a given property formulated in temporal logic. In this paper, we propose
falsification-based RARL (FRARL), the first generic framework for integrating
temporal-logic falsification in adversarial learning to improve policy
robustness. With falsification method, we do not need to construct an extra
reward function for the adversary. We evaluate our approach on a braking

we need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the 'observer' vehicle from that

during training we introduce a series of so-called pretext tasks which also
leverage on image data. These tasks include semantic information about

surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous
vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the
course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting
passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted
preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over
decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system
aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful
methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially
violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information
and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties. In this paper, we
report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making
approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the notion of differential privacy to
quantify privacy and consider four granularities of privacy protection by
taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed
perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and
RLDP. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy
protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral
preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data
aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged
moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are
implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral

detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores
such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are
available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs
to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute
models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we
emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model
decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world
black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are
easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple
defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this
category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce
the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large
adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while
staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no
hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive
with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like
ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com.

approaches for autonomous car prediction and planning have achieved
extraordinary performance. Nevertheless, most of these approaches follow a
non-interactive prediction and planning paradigm, hypothesizing that a
vehicle's behaviors do not affect others. The approaches based on such a
non-interactive philosophy typically perform acceptably in sparse traffic
scenarios but can easily fail in dense traffic scenarios. Therefore, we propose
an end-to-end interactive neural motion planner (INMP) for autonomous driving
in this paper. Given a set of past surrounding-view images and a high
definition map, our INMP first generates a feature map in bird's-eye-view
space, which is then processed to detect other agents and perform interactive
prediction and planning jointly. Also, we adopt an optical flow distillation
paradigm, which can effectively improve the network performance while still
maintaining its real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments on the
nuScenes dataset and in the closed-loop Carla simulation environment
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our INMP for the detection,
prediction, and planning tasks. Our project page is at

for better perception is becoming a natural trend. So far, there has been no
indepth review that focuses on multi-sensor fusion based perception. To bridge
this gap and motivate future research, this survey devotes to review recent
fusion-based 3D detection deep learning models that leverage multiple sensor
data sources, especially cameras and LiDARs. In this survey, we first introduce
the background of popular sensors for autonomous cars, including their common
data representations as well as object detection networks developed for each
type of sensor data. Next, we discuss some popular datasets for multi-modal 3D
object detection, with a special focus on the sensor data included in each
dataset. Then we present in-depth reviews of recent multi-modal 3D detection
networks by considering the following three aspects of the fusion: fusion
location, fusion data representation, and fusion granularity. After a detailed
review, we discuss open challenges and point out possible solutions. We hope
that our detailed review can help researchers to embark investigations in the

despite many safety challenges that are yet to be resolved. It is well known
that there are no universally agreed Verification and Validation (VV)
methodologies to guarantee absolute safety, which is crucial for the acceptance
of this technology. Existing standards focus on deterministic processes where
the validation requires only a set of test cases that cover the requirements.
Modern autonomous vehicles will undoubtedly include machine learning and
probabilistic techniques that require a much more comprehensive testing regime
due to the non-deterministic nature of the operating design domain. A rigourous
statistical validation process is an essential component required to address
this challenge. Most research in this area focuses on evaluating system
performance in large scale real-world data gathering exercises (number of miles
travelled), or randomised test scenarios in simulation.
  This paper presents a new approach to compute the statistical characteristics
of a system's behaviour by biasing automatically generated test cases towards
the worst case scenarios, identifying potential unsafe edge cases.We use
reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the behaviours of simulated actors that
cause unsafe behaviour measured by the well established RSS safety metric. We

  Testing","Recently, it has been shown that deep neural networks (DNN) are subject to
attacks through adversarial samples. Adversarial samples are often crafted
through adversarial perturbation, i.e., manipulating the original sample with
minor modifications so that the DNN model labels the sample incorrectly. Given
that it is almost impossible to train perfect DNN, adversarial samples are
shown to be easy to generate. As DNN are increasingly used in safety-critical
systems like autonomous cars, it is crucial to develop techniques for defending
such attacks. Existing defense mechanisms which aim to make adversarial
perturbation challenging have been shown to be ineffective. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach. We first observe that adversarial samples are
much more sensitive to perturbations than normal samples. That is, if we impose
random perturbations on a normal and an adversarial sample respectively, there
is a significant difference between the ratio of label change due to the
perturbations. Observing this, we design a statistical adversary detection
algorithm called nMutant (inspired by mutation testing from software
engineering community). Our experiments show that nMutant effectively detects
most of the adversarial samples generated by recently proposed attacking
methods. Furthermore, we provide an error bound with certain statistical

restoring a clean image from its distorted version. There are many different
types of distortion which affect image quality. Previous studies have focused
on single types of distortion, proposing methods for removing them. However,
image quality degrades due to multiple factors in the real world. Thus,
depending on applications, e.g., vision for autonomous cars or surveillance
cameras, we need to be able to deal with multiple combined distortions with
unknown mixture ratios. For this purpose, we propose a simple yet effective
layer architecture of neural networks. It performs multiple operations in
parallel, which are weighted by an attention mechanism to enable selection of
proper operations depending on the input. The layer can be stacked to form a
deep network, which is differentiable and thus can be trained in an end-to-end

with the increasing usage of DNN models in safety-critical domains such as

set, which is a random subset of the dataset about the problem of interest.
This kind of approach is not enough for testing most of the real-world
scenarios since these traditional test sets do not include corner cases, while
a corner case input is generally considered to introduce erroneous behaviors.
Recent works on adversarial input generation, data augmentation, and
coverage-guided fuzzing (CGF) have provided new ways to extend traditional test
sets. Among those, CGF aims to produce new test inputs by fuzzing existing ones
to achieve high coverage on a test adequacy criterion (i.e. coverage
criterion). Given that the subject test adequacy criterion is a
well-established one, CGF can potentially find error inducing inputs for
different underlying reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel CGF solution
for structural testing of DNNs. The proposed fuzzer employs Monte Carlo Tree

object segmentation module presents a set of challenges that are significantly
different from traditional development of safety critical software. The
development process in use consists of multiple iterations of data collection,

evaluation are computation intensive while data collection and labelling are
manual labour intensive. This paper shows how development of DNN based object
segmentation can be improved by exploiting the correlation between Surprise
Adequacy (SA) and model performance. The correlation allows us to predict model
performance for inputs without manually labelling them. This, in turn, enables
understanding of model performance, more guided data collection, and informed

the distribution of missing values by the Mixture of Factor Analyzers, we cover
the spectrum of possible replacements and find an analytical formula for the

tracking state estimation problems critical to autonomous vehicles and
robotics. Measurement uncertainties in state estimation systems based on Kalman
and other Bayes filters are typically assumed to be a fixed covariance matrix.
This assumption is risky, particularly for ""black box"" deep learning models, in
which uncertainty can vary dramatically and unexpectedly. Accurate
quantification of multivariate uncertainty will allow for the full potential of
deep learning to be used more safely and reliably in these applications. We
show how to model multivariate uncertainty for regression problems with neural
networks, incorporating both aleatoric and epistemic sources of heteroscedastic
uncertainty. We train a deep uncertainty covariance matrix model in two ways:
directly using a multivariate Gaussian density loss function, and indirectly
using end-to-end training through a Kalman filter. We experimentally show in a
visual tracking problem the large impact that accurate multivariate uncertainty
quantification can have on Kalman filter performance for both in-domain and
out-of-domain evaluation data. We additionally show in a challenging visual
odometry problem how end-to-end filter training can allow uncertainty
predictions to compensate for filter weaknesses.",arxiv

safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). They are often co-located with
traditional embedded software, and may perform advisory or control-based roles.
It is important to validate both the timing and functional correctness of these
systems. However, most approaches in the literature consider guaranteeing only
the functionality of ANN based controllers. This issue stems largely from the
implementation strategies used within common neural network frameworks -- their
underlying source code is often simply unsuitable for formal techniques such as
static timing analysis. As a result, developers of safety-critical CPS must
rely on informal techniques such as measurement based approaches to prove
correctness, techniques that provide weak guarantees at best. In this work we
address this challenge. We propose a design pipeline whereby neural networks
trained using the popular deep learning framework Keras are compiled to
functionally equivalent C code. This C code is restricted to simple constructs
that may be analysed by existing static timing analysis tools. As a result, if
compiled to a suitable time-predictable platform all execution bounds may be
statically derived. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach we execute an
ANN trained to drive an autonomous vehicle around a race track. We compile the
ANN to the Patmos time-predictable controller, and show that we can derive
worst case execution timings.",arxiv

offers a promising method for representing uncertainty in neural network.
However, BDL requires a separate set of parameters to store the mean and
standard deviation of model weights to learn a distribution. This results in a
prohibitive 2-fold increase in the number of model parameters. To address this
problem we present a method for performing BDL, namely Kernel Seed Networks
(KSN), which does not require a 2-fold increase in the number of parameters.
KSNs use 1x1 Convolution operations to learn a compressed latent space

the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to
manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent
developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ
blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environments and make
driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy
autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society
becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency,
trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the
compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through
the provision of explanations for AVs' behaviour. Explainability is therefore
seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what
they have 'seen', done, and might do in environments in which they operate.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing body of work
around explainable autonomous driving. First, we open with a motivation for
explanations by highlighting and emphasising the importance of transparency,
accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and
standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different
stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit
their explanation requirements for AV. Third, we provide a rigorous review of
previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e.,
perception, localisation, planning, control, and system management). Finally,
we identify pertinent challenges and provide recommendations, such as a
conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the

assimilating the information from the CAN bus. The conventional way of parsing
the decision commands is motion planning, which uses a path tracking algorithm
to evaluate the decision commands. This study focuses on designing a robust
controller using behavioral cloning and motion planning of autonomous vehicle

the pipeline of parsing decision commands from the path tracking algorithm to
the controller and proposed a neural network-based controller (N 2 C) using
behavioral cloning. The proposed network predicts throttle, brake, and torque
when trained with the manual driving data acquired from the CAN bus. The
efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the accuracy with
the Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller in conjunction with the
path tracking algorithm (pure pursuit and model predictive control based path
follower). The second part of this study complements N 2 C, in which an
end-to-end neural network for predicting the speed and steering angle is

driving scene analysis using dash cameras on vehicles and deep learning
algorithms is of paramount importance. Although these technologies are
increasingly available, driving scene analysis for this purpose still remains a
challenge. This is mainly due to the lack of annotated large image datasets for
analyzing crash risk indicators and crash likelihood, and the lack of an
effective method to extract lots of required information from complex driving

Multi-Net of the system includes two multi-task neural networks that perform

YOLO v3 are combined by the system to detect and locate risky pedestrians and
the nearest vehicles. All identified information can provide the situational
awareness to autonomous vehicles or human drivers for identifying crash risks
from the surrounding traffic. To address the scarcity of annotated image
datasets for studying traffic crashes, two completely new datasets have been
developed by this paper and made available to the public, which were proved to
be effective in training the proposed deep neural networks. The paper further

  Reinforcement Learning","Finding the most likely path to a set of failure states is important to the
analysis of safety-critical systems that operate over a sequence of time steps,
such as aircraft collision avoidance systems and autonomous cars. In many
applications such as autonomous driving, failures cannot be completely
eliminated due to the complex stochastic environment in which the system
operates. As a result, safety validation is not only concerned about whether a
failure can occur, but also discovering which failures are most likely to
occur. This article presents adaptive stress testing (AST), a framework for
finding the most likely path to a failure event in simulation. We consider a
general black box setting for partially observable and continuous-valued
systems operating in an environment with stochastic disturbances. We formulate
the problem as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning to
optimize it. The approach is simulation-based and does not require internal
knowledge of the system, making it suitable for black-box testing of large
systems. We present formulations for fully observable and partially observable
systems. In the latter case, we present a modified Monte Carlo tree search
algorithm that only requires access to the pseudorandom number generator of the
simulator to overcome partial observability. We also present an extension of
the framework, called differential adaptive stress testing (DAST), that can
find failures that occur in one system but not in another. This type of
differential analysis is useful in applications such as regression testing,
where we are concerned with finding areas of relative weakness compared to a

then transferred to the real world, is a technique that enables faster deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) training. However, differences between the
simulator and the real world often cause the model to perform poorly in the
real world. Domain randomization is a way to bridge the sim-to-real gap by
exposing the model to a wide range of scenarios so that it can generalize to
real-world situations. However, following domain randomization to train an
autonomous car racing model with DRL can lead to undesirable outcomes. Namely,
a model trained with randomization tends to run slower; a higher completion
rate on the testing track comes at the expense of longer lap times. This paper
aims to boost the robustness of a trained race car model without compromising
racing lap times. For a training track and a testing track having the same
shape (and same optimal paths), but with different lighting, background, etc.,
we first train a model (teacher model) that overfits the training track, moving
along a near optimal path. We then use this model to teach a student model the
correct actions along with randomization. With our method, a model with 18.4\%
completion rate on the testing track is able to help teach a student model with
52\% completion. Moreover, over an average of 50 trials, the student is able to

its inherent capability of processing multiple kernels to capture salient

with different kernel sizes and input sequence lengths and concatenate them to
get proper embedding. As kernels strides over different receptive fields, they
detect smaller and bigger salient features at multiple temporal scales. Our
main contribution is to propose a residual connection between input and the
output of the inception block to have a continuity between the previously
observed pose and the next predicted pose. With this proposed architecture, it
learns prior knowledge much better about human poses and we achieve much higher
prediction accuracy as detailed in the paper. Subsequently, we further propose
to feed the output of the inception residual block as an input to the Graph
Convolution Neural Network (GCN) due to its better spatial feature learning
capability. We perform a parametric analysis for better designing of our model

  Reinforcement Learning","Deep Neural Network-based systems are now the state-of-the-art in many
robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains
dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations
to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to
change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous
vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous
algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial
inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates.
This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an
online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The
proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during
execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst-case deviation
in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting
policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state
and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The
approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase
robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios
and a classic control task. This work extends one of our prior works with new

can greatly enhance operation in terms of safety and mobility, and high-level
cooperation between CAVs can be expected by jointly plan and control within CAV

among which automatic lane keeping. The latter allows the car to properly
position itself within the road lanes, which is also crucial for any subsequent
lane departure or trajectory planning decision in fully autonomous cars.
Traditional lane detection methods rely on a combination of highly-specialized,
hand-crafted features and heuristics, usually followed by post-processing
techniques, that are computationally expensive and prone to scalability due to
road scene variations. More recent approaches leverage deep learning models,
trained for pixel-wise lane segmentation, even when no markings are present in
the image due to their big receptive field. Despite their advantages, these
methods are limited to detecting a pre-defined, fixed number of lanes, e.g.
ego-lanes, and can not cope with lane changes. In this paper, we go beyond the
aforementioned limitations and propose to cast the lane detection problem as an
instance segmentation problem - in which each lane forms its own instance -
that can be trained end-to-end. To parametrize the segmented lane instances
before fitting the lane, we further propose to apply a learned perspective
transformation, conditioned on the image, in contrast to a fixed ""bird's-eye
view"" transformation. By doing so, we ensure a lane fitting which is robust
against road plane changes, unlike existing approaches that rely on a fixed,
pre-defined transformation. In summary, we propose a fast lane detection
algorithm, running at 50 fps, which can handle a variable number of lanes and
cope with lane changes. We verify our method on the tuSimple dataset and

It is remarkable that the debate about autonomous vehicles focuses almost

important autonomous system design issues. Autonomous systems involve agents
and objects coordinated in some common environment so that their collective
behavior meets a set of global goals. We propose a general computational model

model allows expression of dynamic reconfigurable multi-mode coordination
between components. The agent model consists of five interacting modules
implementing each one a characteristic function: Perception, Reflection, Goal
management, Planning and Self-adaptation. It determines a concept of autonomic
complexity accounting for the specific difficulty to build autonomous systems.
We emphasize that the main characteristic of autonomous systems is their
ability to handle knowledge and adaptively respond to environment changes. We
advocate that autonomy should be associated with functionality and not with
specific techniques. Machine learning is essential for autonomy although it can
meet only a small portion of the needs implied by autonomous system design. We

of machine learning tasks, with recent examples in cyber security and

applications, it has been recently shown that these models are susceptible to a
particular type of attack that exploits a fundamental flaw in their design.
This attack consists of generating particular synthetic examples referred to as
adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by slightly manipulating
real data-points in order to ""fool"" the original DNN model, forcing it to
mis-classify previously correctly classified samples with high confidence.
Addressing this flaw in the model is essential if DNNs are to be used in
critical applications such as those in cyber security.
  Previous work has provided various learning algorithms to enhance the
robustness of DNN models, and they all fall into the tactic of ""security

obscure the learning algorithms from adversaries. Once the learning technique
is disclosed, DNNs protected by these defense mechanisms are still susceptible
to adversarial samples. In this work, we investigate this issue shared across

transformative technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis;
beyond this, they also serve as candidate models for the visual system itself

divergence between human and machine classification challenges the promise of
these new advances, both as applied image-recognition systems and also as

investigated human classification of such adversarial stimuli: Does human and
machine performance fundamentally diverge? Or could humans decipher such images
and predict the machine's preferred labels? Here, we show that human and
machine classification of adversarial stimuli are robustly related: In eight
experiments on five prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects
reliably identified the machine's chosen label over relevant foils. This
pattern persisted for images with strong antecedent identities, and even for

vehicles should be aware of their surroundings and make decisions by
interacting with other road participants. Moreover, different strategies should
be made when the autonomous vehicle is interacting with drivers having
different level of cooperativeness. Whether the vehicle is on the merge-lane or
main-lane will also influence the driving maneuvers since drivers will behave
differently when they have the right-of-way than otherwise. Many traditional
methods have been proposed to solve decision making problems under merging
scenarios. However, these works either are incapable of modeling complicated
interactions or require implementing hand-designed rules which cannot properly
handle the uncertainties in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an
interaction-aware decision making with adaptive strategies (IDAS) approach that
can let the autonomous vehicle negotiate the road with other drivers by
leveraging their cooperativeness under merging scenarios. A single policy is
learned under the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting via the
curriculum learning strategy, which enables the agent to automatically infer
other drivers' various behaviors and make decisions strategically. A masking
mechanism is also proposed to prevent the agent from exploring states that
violate common sense of human judgment and increase the learning efficiency. An
exemplar merging scenario was used to implement and examine the proposed
method.",arxiv

  controllers: A human factors approach","A major challenge for autonomous vehicles is interacting with other traffic
participants safely and smoothly. A promising approach to handle such traffic
interactions is equipping autonomous vehicles with interaction-aware
controllers (IACs). These controllers predict how surrounding human drivers
will respond to the autonomous vehicle's actions, based on a driver model.
However, the predictive validity of driver models used in IACs is rarely
validated, which can limit the interactive capabilities of IACs outside the
simple simulated environments in which they are demonstrated. In this paper, we
argue that besides evaluating the interactive capabilities of IACs, their
underlying driver models should be validated on natural human driving behavior.
We propose a workflow for this validation that includes scenario-based data
extraction and a two-stage (tactical/operational) evaluation procedure based on
human factors literature. We demonstrate this workflow in a case study on an
inverse-reinforcement-learning-based driver model replicated from an existing
IAC. This model only showed the correct tactical behavior in 40% of the
predictions. The model's operational behavior was inconsistent with observed
human behavior. The case study illustrates that a principled evaluation
workflow is useful and needed. We believe that our workflow will support the
development of appropriate driver models for future automated vehicles.",arxiv

atmospheric events, tracking traffic congestion and air pollution levels,

varying from Web crawlers for search engines, to chatbots for online customer
service, spambots on social media, and content-editing bots in online
collaboration communities. The online world has turned into an ecosystem of
bots. However, our knowledge of how these automated agents are interacting with
each other is rather poor. Bots are predictable automatons that do not have the
capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it is
hence natural to expect interactions between bots to be relatively predictable
and uneventful. In this article, we analyze the interactions between bots that
edit articles on Wikipedia. We track the extent to which bots undid each
other's edits over the period 2001-2010, model how pairs of bots interact over
time, and identify different types of interaction trajectories. We find that,
although Wikipedia bots are intended to support the encyclopedia, they often
undo each other's edits and these sterile ""fights"" may sometimes continue for
years. Unlike humans on Wikipedia, bots' interactions tend to occur over longer
periods of time and to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bots in
different cultural environments may behave differently. Our research suggests
that even relatively ""dumb"" bots may give rise to complex interactions, and
this carries important implications for Artificial Intelligence research.

explorer collect the data. Supervised learning has been explored for AV
control, but it encounters the issue of the covariate shift. That is, training
data collected from an optimal demonstration consists only of the states
induced by the optimal control policy, but at runtime, the trained agent may
encounter a vastly different state distribution with little relevant training

replace these action with the correct action. Erasing is wasteful and replacing
is difficult, since it is not easy to know the correct action without driving.
We propose an alternate framework that includes continuous scalar feedback for
each action, marking which actions we should replicate, which we should avoid,

field of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular,
multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and

localize the robot according to correspondences between the map and the
observed visual road topology, inspired by the rough localization that human
drivers can perform. We test our algorithms on real-world driving data that the
vehicle has never driven through before, and integrate our point-to-point

and develop the Minimax Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (Minimax DSAC)
algorithm. Minimax formulation aims to seek optimal policy considering the most
severe variations from environment, in which the protagonist policy maximizes
action-value function while the adversary policy tries to minimize it.
Distributional framework aims to learn a state-action return distribution, from
which we can model the risk of different returns explicitly, thereby
formulating a risk-averse protagonist policy and a risk-seeking adversarial
policy. We implement our method on the decision-making tasks of autonomous
vehicles at intersections and test the trained policy in distinct environments.
Results demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the generalization
ability of the protagonist agent to different environmental variations.",arxiv

investigated to bring eco-solutions at the edge. This joint problem aims to
combat against the power-hungry edge nodes while maintaining assured

communication of dynamic eco-routing, highly mobile autonomous vehicles are
served with multiple low-powered access points (APs) simultaneously for
ubiquitous connectivity and guaranteed reliability of the network. The
formulated optimization is exceptionally troublesome to solve within a
polynomial time, due to its complicated combinatorial structure. Hence, a
distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (D-MARL) algorithm is proposed
for eco-vehicular edges, where multiple agents cooperatively learn to receive
the best reward. First, the algorithm segments the centralized action space
into multiple smaller groups. Based on the model-free distributed Q learner,
each edge agent takes its actions from the respective group. Also, in each

failures in autonomous systems. During execution, the RL agents often rely on
some domain-specific heuristic reward to guide them towards finding failures,
but constructing such a heuristic may be difficult or infeasible. Without a
heuristic, the agent may only receive rewards at the time of failure, or even
rewards that guide it away from failures. For example, some approaches give
rewards for taking more-likely actions, because we want to find more-likely
failures. However, the agent may then learn to only take likely actions, and
may not be able to find a failure at all. Consequently, the problem becomes a
hard-exploration problem, where rewards do not aid exploration. A new
algorithm, go-explore (GE), has recently set new records on benchmarks from the
hard-exploration field. We apply GE to adaptive stress testing (AST), one
example of an RL-based falsification approach that provides a way to search for
the most-likely failure scenario. We simulate a scenario where an autonomous
vehicle drives while a pedestrian is crossing the road. We demonstrate that GE
is able to find failures without domain-specific heuristics, such as the
distance between the car and the pedestrian, on scenarios that other RL
techniques are unable to solve. Furthermore, inspired by the robustification
phase of GE, we demonstrate that the backwards algorithm (BA) improves the
failures found by other RL techniques.",arxiv

decision-making problem where, at every time step, it observes its state,
performs an action, receives a reward and moves to a new state. An RL agent
learns by trial and error a good policy (or controller) based on observations
and numeric reward feedback on the previously performed action. In this

of approaches that have been developed to learn a good policy. The first one,
which is value-based, consists in estimating the value of an optimal policy,
value from which a policy can be recovered, while the other, called policy
search, directly works in a policy space. Actor-critic methods can be seen as a
policy search technique where the policy value that is learned guides the

real-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
human-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep
learning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance
segmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In
particular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class
is a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a
usual bin-picking scene, many indentical objects are stacked together and the
model of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;
instead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.
Based on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)
for instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named
FPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for
inferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing
features of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers
geometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the
proposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest
geometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also
surpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally
efficient. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC.",arxiv

detection and ranging (LIDAR). Although it can provide precise distance
measurements, most LIDARs are still far too expensive to sell in mass-produced
consumer vehicles, which has motivated methods to generate depth information
from commodity automotive sensors like cameras.
  In this paper, we propose an approach called Deep Sensor Cloning (DSC). The
idea is to use Convolutional Neural Networks in conjunction with inexpensive
sensors to replicate the 3D point-clouds that are created by expensive LIDARs.
To accomplish this, we develop a new dataset (DSDepth) and a new family of CNN
architectures (DSCnets). While previous tasks such as KITTI depth prediction
use an interpolated RGB-D images as ground-truth for training, we instead use
DSCnets to directly predict LIDAR point-clouds. When we compare the output of
our models to a $75,000 LIDAR, we find that our most accurate DSCnet achieves a
relative error of 5.77% using a single camera and 4.69% using stereo cameras.",arxiv

unsatisfactory performance in handling some extremely-bad situations such as
heavy shadow, severe mark degradation, serious vehicle occlusion, and so on. In
fact, lanes are continuous line structures on the road. Consequently, the lane
that cannot be accurately detected in one current frame may potentially be
inferred out by incorporating information of previous frames. To this end, we
investigate lane detection by using multiple frames of a continuous driving
scene, and propose a hybrid deep architecture by combining the convolutional
neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically,
information of each frame is abstracted by a CNN block, and the CNN features of
multiple continuous frames, holding the property of time-series, are then fed

applied to efficiently cover the entire point set. Successively, we employ the
k-nearest neighbours (knn) algorithm to gather local neighbourhood for each

consecutive video frames in order to perform motion compensation and thus
predict block pixel values and reduce transmission bandwidth. In order to
reduce the magnitude of the transmitted Motion Vector (MV) and thus reduce
bandwidth, the encoder utilizes Predicted Motion Vector (PMV), which is derived
by taking the median vector of the corresponding MVs of the neighboring blocks.
In this research, we propose innovative methods, based on neural networks
prediction, for improving the accuracy of the calculated PMV. We begin by
showing a straightforward approach of calculating the best matching PMV and
signaling its neighbor block index value to the decoder while reducing the
number of bits required to represent the result without adding any computation
complexity. Then we use a classification Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)
to estimate from neighbors the PMV without requiring signaling and show the
advantage of the approach when employed for high motion movies. We demonstrate
the advantages using fast forward movies. However, the same improvements apply
to camera streams of autonomous vehicles, drone cameras, Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ)
cameras, and similar applications whereas the MVs magnitudes are expected to be
large. We also introduce a regression FCNN to predict the PMV. We calculate

tool for guaranteeing safety for low-dimensional systems. However, due to its
exponential complexity in computation time, no reachability-based methods have
been able to guarantee safety for more than three vehicles successfully in
unstructured scenarios. For systems with four or more vehicles,we can only

Therefore, a distributed Edge Cloud must be in charge to process images

improving accuracy of edge models without any extra compute cost by means of
automatic model specialization. First, we show how the sole assumption of
static cameras allows us to make a series of considerations that greatly
simplify the scope of the problem. Then, we present Edge AutoTuner, a framework

feasible option of transforming an electric ride-on-car into a modular Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU) powered autonomous platform equipped with the capability
that supports test and deployment of various intelligent autonomous vehicles

perception and control. The sensors such as incremental encoders, an Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU), a camera, and a LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)
must be able to be installed on the platform to add the capability of
environmental perception. A microcontroller-powered control box is designed to
properly respond to the environmental changes by regulating drive and steering
motors. This drive-by-wire capability is controlled by a GPU powered laptop
computer where high-level perception algorithms are processed and complex
actions are generated by various methods including behavior cloning using deep

comprehensive approach for fabricating a cost-effective platform that would
contribute to the research quality from the wider community. The proposed
platform is to use a modular and hierarchical software architecture where the
lower and simpler motor controls are taken care of by microcontroller programs,
and the higher and complex algorithms are processed by a GPU powered laptop
computer. The platform uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) as middleware to
maintain the modularity of the perceptions and decision-making modules. It is

  with Grouped Convolutions","The task of following-the-leader is implemented using a hierarchical Deep
Neural Network (DNN) end-to-end driving model to match the direction and speed
of a target pedestrian. The model uses a classifier DNN to determine if the
pedestrian is within the field of view of the camera sensor. If the pedestrian
is present, the image stream from the camera is fed to a regression DNN which
simultaneously adjusts the autonomous vehicle's steering and throttle to keep
cadence with the pedestrian. If the pedestrian is not visible, the vehicle uses
a straightforward exploratory search strategy to reacquire the tracking
objective. The classifier and regression DNNs incorporate grouped convolutions
to boost model performance as well as to significantly reduce parameter count
and compute latency. The models are trained on the Intelligence Processing Unit
(IPU) to leverage its fine-grain compute capabilities in order to minimize
time-to-train. The results indicate very robust tracking behavior on the part
of the autonomous vehicle in terms of its steering and throttle profiles, while
requiring minimal data collection to produce. The throughput in terms of
processing training samples has been boosted by the use of the IPU in
conjunction with grouped convolutions by a factor ~3.5 for training of the
classifier and a factor of ~7 for the regression network. A recording of the

involving human users, ensuring a safe interaction between them becomes an
important issue. Translating methods from human-robot interaction (HRI) studies
to the interaction between humans and other highly complex machines (e.g.
semi-autonomous vehicles) could help advance the use of those machines in
scenarios requiring human interaction. One method involves understanding human
intentions and decision-making to estimate the human's present and near-future
actions whilst interacting with a robot. This idea originates from the
psychological concept of Theory of Mind, which has been broadly explored for
robotics and recently for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. In this
work, we explored how to predict human intentions before an action is performed
by combining data from human-motion, vehicle-state and human inputs (e.g.
steering wheel, pedals). A data-driven approach based on Recurrent Neural
Network models was used to classify the current driving manoeuvre and to
predict the future manoeuvre to be performed. A state-transition model was used
with a fixed set of manoeuvres to label data recorded during the trials for
real-time applications. Models were trained and tested using drivers of
different seat preferences, driving expertise and arm-length; precision and
recall metrics over 95% for manoeuvre identification and 86% for manoeuvre

  Routing","In this paper, a learning-based optimal transportation algorithm for
autonomous taxis and ridesharing vehicles is presented. The goal is to design a
mechanism to solve the routing problem for multiple autonomous vehicles and
multiple customers in order to maximize the transportation company's profit. As
a result, each vehicle selects the customer whose request maximizes the
company's profit in the long run. To solve this problem, the system is modeled
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using past customers data. By solving the
defined MDP, a centralized high-level planning recommendation is obtained,
where this offline solution is used as an initial value for the real-time
learning. Then, a distributed SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed to capture the model errors and the environment changes, such as
variations in customer distributions in each area, traffic, and fares, thereby
providing optimal routing policies in real-time. Vehicles, or agents, use only
their local information and interaction, such as current passenger requests and
estimates of neighbors' tasks and their optimal actions, to obtain the optimal
policies in a distributed fashion. An optimal adaptive rate is introduced to
make the distributed SARSA algorithm capable of adapting to changes in the
environment and tracking the time-varying optimal policies. Furthermore, a
game-theory-based task assignment algorithm is proposed, where each agent uses
the optimal policies and their values from distributed SARSA to select its
customer from the set of local available requests in a distributed manner.

research on using autonomous vehicle technologies for routing and matching. The
future of urban mobility for passengers and goods relies on leveraging new

  This paper considers combining passenger transportation with goods delivery

this paper considers a model-free approach that has been demonstrated to be
adaptable to new or erratic environment dynamics. We propose FlexPool, a
distributed model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly
serves passengers & goods workloads by learning optimal dispatch policies from
its interaction with the environment. The proposed algorithm pools passengers
for a ride-sharing service and delivers goods using a multi-hop transit method.
These flexibilities decrease the fleet's operational cost and environmental
footprint while maintaining service levels for passengers and goods. Through
simulations on a realistic multi-agent urban mobility platform, we demonstrate
that FlexPool outperforms other model-free settings in serving the demands from
passengers & goods. FlexPool achieves 30% higher fleet utilization and 35%

humanities, art, and many other human endeavors. In recent years, a number of

beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future
technological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest
sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many
aspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules

daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully
described in the context of a hypothetical ""intelligence explosion,"" in which
the capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to
the presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The
possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of
sophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical
problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent
from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
guides the agent's actions. The ""value alignment problem"" is to specify a goal
structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief
article, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related

expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn
the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such
temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example,
many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through
machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we
propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an
expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce
probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe
controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption
that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables.
One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is
adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its
beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We
demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL

consensus on how they should do so, nor on a model for specifying a desired
driving behavior. We created a dataset to help address some of these questions
in a limited operating domain. The data consists of 92 traffic scenarios, with
multiple ways of traversing each scenario. Multiple annotators expressed their
preference between pairs of scenario traversals. We used the data to compare an
instance of a rulebook, carefully hand-crafted independently of the dataset,
with several interpretable machine learning models such as Bayesian networks,
decision trees, and logistic regression trained on the dataset. To compare
driving behavior, these models use scores indicating by how much different
scenario traversals violate each of 14 driving rules. The rules are
interpretable and designed by subject-matter experts. First, we found that
these rules were enough for these models to achieve a high classification
accuracy on the dataset. Second, we found that the rulebook provides high
interpretability without excessively sacrificing performance. Third, the data

Mainly, we focus on typical problems of interest which include computing
itineraries that meet certain objectives, as well as computing scheduling
strategies to execute synchronized maneuvers with other vehicles. We present a
range of learning-based heuristics to assist different itinerary planners. We
show that these heuristics allow a significant increase in performance for
optimal planners. Furthermore, in the case of approximate planning, we show
that not only does the running time decrease, the quality of the itinerary
found also becomes almost always better. Finally, in order to synthesize

  One-Click Annotation, and Tracking","LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is an essential and widely adopted sensor
for autonomous vehicles, particularly for those vehicles operating at higher
levels (L4-L5) of autonomy. Recent work has demonstrated the promise of
deep-learning approaches for LiDAR-based detection. However, deep-learning
algorithms are extremely data hungry, requiring large amounts of labeled
point-cloud data for training and evaluation. Annotating LiDAR point cloud data
is challenging due to the following issues: 1) A LiDAR point cloud is usually
sparse and has low resolution, making it difficult for human annotators to
recognize objects. 2) Compared to annotation on 2D images, the operation of
drawing 3D bounding boxes or even point-wise labels on LiDAR point clouds is
more complex and time-consuming. 3) LiDAR data are usually collected in
sequences, so consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to repeated
annotations. To tackle these challenges, we propose LATTE, an open-sourced
annotation tool for LiDAR point clouds. LATTE features the following
innovations: 1) Sensor fusion: We utilize image-based detection algorithms to
automatically pre-label a calibrated image, and transfer the labels to the
point cloud. 2) One-click annotation: Instead of drawing 3D bounding boxes or
point-wise labels, we simplify the annotation to just one click on the target
object, and automatically generate the bounding box for the target. 3)
Tracking: we integrate tracking into sequence annotation such that we can
transfer labels from one frame to subsequent ones and therefore significantly
reduce repeated labeling. Experiments show the proposed features accelerate the
annotation speed by 6.2x and significantly improve label quality with 23.6% and
2.2% higher instance-level precision and recall, and 2.0% higher bounding box

autonomous vehicles. Modern deep learning methods achieve high performance in
lane detection, but it is still difficult to accurately detect lanes in
challenging situations such as congested roads and extreme lighting conditions.
To be robust on these challenging situations, it is important to extract global
contextual information even from limited visual cues. In this paper, we propose
a simple but powerful self-attention mechanism optimized for lane detection
called the Expanded Self Attention (ESA) module. Inspired by the simple
geometric structure of lanes, the proposed method predicts the confidence of a
lane along the vertical and horizontal directions in an image. The prediction
of the confidence enables estimating occluded locations by extracting global
contextual information. ESA module can be easily implemented and applied to any
encoder-decoder-based model without increasing the inference time. The
performance of our method is evaluated on three popular lane detection
benchmarks (TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K). We achieve state-of-the-art
performance in CULane and BDD100K and distinct improvement on TuSimple dataset.
The experimental results show that our approach is robust to occlusion and

Random finite set (RFS) based approaches can naturally model these
uncertainties accurately and elegantly, and they have been widely used in
radar-based tracking applications. In this work, we developed an RFS-based MOT
framework for 3D LiDAR data. In partiuclar, we propose a Poisson

a first attempt for employing an RFS-based approach in conjunction with 3D

trajectories, because the sensor motion needs to be compensated to avoid
distortions. When autonomous vehicles are sending LiDAR point clouds to deep
networks for perception and planning, could the motion compensation
consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the
adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory
estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such
possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud
coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only
adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car's trajectory with small
perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or
detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation
is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack.
Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not

  In this paper, we introduce a new type of adversarial patch which alters a

Fine-tuning the model for every new setup is infeasible due to the expensive

  Systems","Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in many autonomous
systems such as autonomous driving. Recently, DNN testing has been intensively
studied to automatically generate adversarial examples, which inject
small-magnitude perturbations into inputs to test DNNs under extreme
situations. While existing testing techniques prove to be effective, they
mostly focus on generating digital adversarial perturbations (particularly for
autonomous driving), e.g., changing image pixels, which may never happen in
physical world. There is a critical missing piece in the literature on
autonomous driving testing: understanding and exploiting both digital and
physical adversarial perturbation generation for impacting steering decisions.
In this paper, we present DeepBillboard, a systematic physical-world testing
approach targeting at a common and practical driving scenario: drive-by
billboards. DeepBillboard is capable of generating a robust and resilient
printable adversarial billboard, which works under dynamic changing driving
conditions including viewing angle, distance, and lighting. The objective is to
maximize the possibility, degree, and duration of the steering-angle errors of
an autonomous vehicle driving by the generated adversarial billboard. We have
extensively evaluated the efficacy and robustness of DeepBillboard through
conducting both digital and physical-world experiments. Results show that
DeepBillboard is effective for various steering models and scenes. Furthermore,
DeepBillboard is sufficiently robust and resilient for generating
physical-world adversarial billboard tests for real-world driving under various
weather conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating the possibility of generating realistic and continuous
physical-world tests for practical autonomous driving systems.",arxiv

framework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this

nested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and
soft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the
survey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four
current travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new
travel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently
outperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by
about 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance
improvement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to
MTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization
methods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning
endowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs
are also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the
substitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important
than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this
study introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates
its theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and
interpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect
the speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.",arxiv

address this limitation, decision-based attacks have been proposed which can
estimate the model but they require several thousand queries to generate a

for estimating a sample on the classification boundary using a target image and
a randomly selected image from another class. Secondly, we propose an
optimization algorithm which first, introduces a small perturbation in some

all locations, with floating point computations repeated across a match volume
with dimensions corresponding to both space and disparity. This leads to longer
running times to process each image pair, making them impractical for real-time

employs a significantly more efficient network architecture. Our method builds
an initial match cost volume using traditional matching costs that are fast to

consider the problem of synthesizing safe and robust controllers for robotic
systems which rely on complex perception modules for feedback. We propose a
counterexample-guided synthesis framework that iteratively builds simple
surrogate models of the complex perception module and enables us to find safe
control policies. The framework uses a falsifier to find counterexamples, or
traces of the systems that violate a safety property, to extract information
that enables efficient modeling of the perception modules and errors in it.
These models are then used to synthesize controllers that are robust to errors
in perception. If the resulting policy is not safe, we gather new
counterexamples. By repeating the process, we eventually find a controller
which can keep the system safe even when there is a perception failure. We
demonstrate our framework on two scenarios in simulation, namely lane keeping
and automatic braking, and show that it generates controllers that are safe, as
well as a simpler model of a deep neural network-based perception system that
can provide meaningful insight into operations of the perception system.",arxiv

changes at runtime through a mechanism we term runtime interchange. Our
approach functions via a continual exchange and selection process of multiple
pre-verified controllers. It represents a key step on the way to
component-oriented engineering for intelligent designs, as it preserves the
behaviours of the original controllers while introducing additional
functionality. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach we utilise an
existing autonomous driving case study as well as a set of smaller benchmarks.
These show that introduced overheads are extremely minimal and that the
approach is very scalable.",arxiv

  LiDAR","The current autonomous driving architecture places a heavy burden in signal
processing for the graphics processing units (GPUs) in the car. This directly
translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in
electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and
other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor
at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles.
LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make
relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the
car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla.
The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields
of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the
smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount
of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes
challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the
car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud.
However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to
be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated
set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view
with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body
which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit
rate in the downlink and with the required latency. The calculations we have
based on industry standard equipment from several manufacturers show that this
is not just a concept but a feasible system which can be implemented.The
proposed system can play a supportive role with existing autonomous vehicle
architecture and it is easily applicable in an urban area.",arxiv

  Processing","There is much interest in incorporating inference capabilities into
sensor-rich embedded platforms such as autonomous vehicles, wearables, and
others. A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract
information locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This
necessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical
sensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and
computational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements
of the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy
consumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in
transferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)
and the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor
(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing
architecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by
embedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and
retraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal
computations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a
sensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure
from the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be
designed by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in
the analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)
array. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral
and energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the
process, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine
learning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying
computational fabric.",arxiv

  over control (and hand it back)?","There is much debate in machine ethics about the most appropriate way to
introduce ethical reasoning capabilities into intelligent autonomous machines.
Recent incidents involving autonomous vehicles in which humans have been killed
or injured have raised questions about how we ensure that such vehicles have an
ethical dimension to their behaviour and are therefore trustworthy. The main
problem is that hardwiring such machines with rules not to cause harm or damage
is not consistent with the notion of autonomy and intelligence. Also, such
ethical hardwiring does not leave intelligent autonomous machines with any
course of action if they encounter situations or dilemmas for which they are
not programmed or where some harm is caused no matter what course of action is
taken. Teaching machines so that they learn ethics may also be problematic
given recent findings in machine learning that machines pick up the prejudices
and biases embedded in their learning algorithms or data. This paper describes
a fuzzy reasoning approach to machine ethics. The paper shows how it is
possible for an ethics architecture to reason when taking over from a human
driver is morally justified. The design behind such an ethical reasoner is also
applied to an ethical dilemma resolution case. One major advantage of the
approach is that the ethical reasoner can generate its own data for learning
moral rules (hence, autometric) and thereby reduce the possibility of picking
up human biases and prejudices. The results show that a new type of
metric-based ethics appropriate for autonomous intelligent machines is feasible
and that our current concept of ethical reasoning being largely qualitative in
nature may need revising if want to construct future autonomous machines that
have an ethical dimension to their reasoning so that they become moral

  Autonomous Vehicles","Context: Demonstrating high reliability and safety for safety-critical
systems (SCSs) remains a hard problem. Diverse evidence needs to be combined in
a rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other
evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs,
by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes operational
testing even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims.
Objective: We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example to revisit the
problem of demonstrating high reliability. AVs are making their debut on public
roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed.
We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV
type, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method: We apply
new theorems extending Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI), which exploit the
rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse
associated with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define
additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results: Prior
knowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong
expectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at
conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating
the trend of disengagements is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge
that an AV has moved to a less stressful environment. Conclusion: While some
reliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, CBI
removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without
inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required
reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments.
Useful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.",arxiv

conditioning. This step typically includes tasks such as figuring out how to
prepare data for analytics, dealing with inconsistencies in the dataset, and
determining which algorithm (or set of algorithms) will be best suited for the
application. Larger, faster, and messier datasets such as those from Internet
of Things sensors, medical devices or autonomous vehicles only amplify these

detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world. Deep
learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using
camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical
application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state
of the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the
characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing
on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without
additional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to
identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show
that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar
images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections)
and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary
classifier can be used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two
distinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data that are
readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any

stream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive neurofuzzy
systems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open
structure property which enables effective handling of fast and rapidly
changing natures of data streams. The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in
its design principle which involves a high number of free parameters (rule
premise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process. This figure
can even double in the case of type-2 fuzzy system. In this work, a novel
SANFS, namely parsimonious learning machine (PALM), is proposed. PALM features
utilization of a new type of fuzzy rule based on the concept of hyperplane
clustering which significantly reduces the number of network parameters because
it has no rule premise parameters. PALM is proposed in both type-1 and type-2
fuzzy systems where all of which characterize a fully dynamic rule-based
system. That is, it is capable of automatically generating, merging and tuning
the hyperplane-based fuzzy rule in the single pass manner. Moreover, an
extension of PALM, namely recurrent PALM (rPALM), is proposed and adopts the
concept of teacher-forcing mechanism in the deep learning literature. The
efficacy of PALM has been evaluated through numerical study with six real-world

determine whether and when to interact with each surrounding agent. In order to
facilitate the design and testing of prediction and planning modules of AVs,
in-depth understanding of interactive behavior is expected with proper
representation, and events in behavior data need to be extracted and
categorized automatically. Answers to what are the essential patterns of
interactions are also crucial for these motivations in addition to answering
whether and when. Thus, learning to extract interactive driving events and
patterns from human data for tackling the whether-when-what tasks is of
critical importance for AVs. There is, however, no clear definition and
taxonomy of interactive behavior, and most of the existing works are based on
either manual labelling or hand-crafted rules and features. In this paper, we
propose the Interactive Driving event and pattern Extraction Network (IDE-Net),
which is a deep learning framework to automatically extract interaction events
and patterns directly from vehicle trajectories. In IDE-Net, we leverage the
power of multi-task learning and proposed three auxiliary tasks to assist the

spatial-temporal block to encode the trajectory data. Experimental results on

systems to these attacks, systems are still vulnerable to well-crafted attacks.
To address this problem, several adversarial attack detection methods have been
proposed. However, a system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that
are designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent
detection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty
estimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new
method of estimating predictive uncertainty, has been shown to outperform
Monte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach
is that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for
example, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data
samples. In this work, Prior Networks are applied to adversarial attack
detection using measures of uncertainty in a similar fashion to Monte-Carlo
Dropout. Detection based on measures of uncertainty derived from DNNs and
Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles are used as a baseline. Prior Networks are shown
to significantly out-perform these baseline approaches over a range of

different classifier that we trained ourselves, to analyze transferability of
this method. Next, we craft a variety of different black-box attack algorithms
on a facial image dataset assuming minimal adversarial knowledge, to further
assess the robustness of DNNs in facial recognition. While experimenting with
different image distortion techniques, we focus on modifying single optimal
pixels by a large amount, or modifying all pixels by a smaller amount, or
combining these two attack approaches. While our single-pixel attacks achieved
about a 15% average decrease in classifier confidence level for the actual
class, the all-pixel attacks were more successful and achieved up to an 84%
average decrease in confidence, along with an 81.6% misclassification rate, in
the case of the attack that we tested with the highest levels of perturbation.
Even with these high levels of perturbation, the face images remained
identifiable to a human. Understanding how these noised and perturbed images
baffle the classification algorithms can yield valuable advances in the
training of DNNs against defense-aware adversarial attacks, as well as adaptive
noise reduction techniques. We hope our research may help to advance the study
of adversarial attacks on DNNs and defensive mechanisms to counteract them,
particularly in the facial recognition domain.",arxiv

ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles. Many applications
demand for embedded solutions that integrate into existing systems with tight
real-time and power constraints. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presently
achieve record-breaking accuracies in all image understanding benchmarks, but
have a very high computational complexity. Embedded CNNs thus call for small
and efficient, yet very powerful computing platforms. This master thesis
explores the potential of FPGA-based CNN acceleration and demonstrates a fully
functional proof-of-concept CNN implementation on a Zynq System-on-Chip. The
ZynqNet Embedded CNN is designed for image classification on ImageNet and
consists of ZynqNet CNN, an optimized and customized CNN topology, and the
ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator, an FPGA-based architecture for its evaluation.
ZynqNet CNN is a highly efficient CNN topology. Detailed analysis and
optimization of prior topologies using the custom-designed Netscope CNN
Analyzer have enabled a CNN with 84.5% top-5 accuracy at a computational
complexity of only 530 million multiplyaccumulate operations. The topology is
highly regular and consists exclusively of convolutional layers, ReLU
nonlinearities and one global pooling layer. The CNN fits ideally onto the FPGA
accelerator. The ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator allows an efficient evaluation of
ZynqNet CNN. It accelerates the full network based on a nested-loop algorithm
which minimizes the number of arithmetic operations and memory accesses. The
FPGA accelerator has been synthesized using High-Level Synthesis for the Xilinx
Zynq XC-7Z045, and reaches a clock frequency of 200MHz with a device
utilization of 80% to 90 %.",arxiv

  in COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of
governments and national health authorities have set the 2-meter physical
distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other
covered areas. In this research, we develop a hybrid Computer Vision and
YOLOv4-based Deep Neural Network model for automated people detection in the
crowd in indoor and outdoor environments using common CCTV security cameras.
The proposed DNN model in combination with an adapted inverse perspective
mapping (IPM) technique and SORT tracking algorithm leads to a robust people
detection and social distancing monitoring. The model has been trained against
two most comprehensive datasets by the time of the research the Microsoft
Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and Google Open Image datasets. The system
has been evaluated against the Oxford Town Centre dataset with superior
performance compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been
conducted in challenging conditions, including occlusion, partial visibility,
and under lighting variations with the mean average precision of 99.8% and the
real-time speed of 24.1 fps. We also provide an online infection risk
assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from
people's moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. The
developed model is a generic and accurate people detection and tracking
solution that can be applied in many other fields such as autonomous vehicles,
human action recognition, anomaly detection, sports, crowd analysis, or any
other research areas where the human detection is in the centre of attention.",arxiv

  Sign Recognition","Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building
autonomous vehicles, most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to
adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and
generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

autonomous driving. Recent work uses metamorphic testing but is limited to
using equality-based metamorphic relations and does not provide expressiveness
for defining inequality-based metamorphic relations. To encode real world
traffic rules, domain experts must be able to express higher order relations
e.g., a vehicle should decrease speed in certain ratio, when there is a vehicle
x meters ahead and compositionality e.g., a vehicle must have a larger
deceleration, when there is a vehicle ahead and when the weather is rainy and
proportional compounding effect to the test outcome. We design RMT, a
declarative rule-based metamorphic testing framework. It provides three
components that work in concert:(1) a domain specific language that enables an
expert to express higher-order, compositional metamorphic relations, (2)
pluggable transformation engines built on a variety of image and graphics
processing techniques, and (3) automated test generation that translates a
human-written rule to a corresponding executable, metamorphic relation and
synthesizes meaningful inputs.Our evaluation using three driving models shows
that RMT can generate meaningful test cases on which 89% of erroneous
predictions are found by enabling higher-order metamorphic relations.
Compositionality provides further aids for generating meaningful, synthesized
inputs-3012 new images are generated by compositional rules. These detected
erroneous predictions are manually examined and confirmed by six human judges
as meaningful traffic rule violations. RMT is the first to expand automated
testing capability for autonomous vehicles by enabling easy mapping of traffic
regulations to executable metamorphic relations and to demonstrate the benefits
of expressivity, customization, and pluggability.",arxiv

neuronal machinery can yield robust behaviour in a variety of environments
remains unclear. In the fly brain, motion-sensitive neurons indicate the
presence of nearby objects and directional cues are integrated within an area
known as the central complex. Such neuronal machinery, in contrast with the
traditional stream-based approach to signal processing, uses an event-based
approach, with events occurring when changes are sensed by the animal. Contrary
to von Neumann computing architectures, event-based neuromorphic hardware is
designed to process information in an asynchronous and distributed manner.
Inspired by the fly brain, we model, for the first time, a neuromorphic
closed-loop system mimicking essential behaviours observed in flying insects,
such as meandering in clutter and gap crossing, which are highly relevant for
autonomous vehicles. We implemented our system both in software and on
neuromorphic hardware. While moving through an environment, our agent perceives
changes in its surroundings and uses this information for collision avoidance.
The agent's manoeuvres result from a closed action-perception loop implementing
probabilistic decision-making processes. This loop-closure is thought to have
driven the development of neural circuitry in biological agents since the
Cambrian explosion. In the fundamental quest to understand neural computation
in artificial agents, we come closer to understanding and modelling biological
intelligence by closing the loop also in neuromorphic systems. As a closed-loop
system, our system deepens our understanding of processing in neural networks
and computations in biological and artificial systems. With these
investigations, we aim to set the foundations for neuromorphic intelligence in
the future, moving towards leveraging the full potential of neuromorphic
systems.",arxiv

  $β$-VAE for Cyber-Physical Systems","Deep Neural Networks are actively being used in the design of autonomous
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The advantage of these models is their ability
to handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate
representations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that
the sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire
state space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will
likely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution.
These conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as
Out-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for
the safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or
the feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control
action to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD
condition. In this paper, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series
OOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially
across short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data
distribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of
multi-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for
CPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference
times. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single
$\beta$-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent
space sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive
latent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most
likely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an
Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset

  conditional probabilistic models of agent futures","This paper presents fast non-sampling based methods to assess the risk for
trajectories of autonomous vehicles when probabilistic predictions of other
agents' futures are generated by deep neural networks (DNNs). The presented
methods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions
including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models to predict both agent
positions and control inputs conditioned on the scene contexts. We show that
the problem of risk assessment when Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of agent
positions are learned can be solved rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy
with existing numerical methods. To address the problem of risk assessment for
non-Gaussian mixture models of agent position, we propose finding upper bounds
on risk using nonlinear Chebyshev's Inequality and sums-of-squares (SOS)
programming; they are both of interest as the former is much faster while the
latter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only require higher order
statistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on risk. To
perform risk assessment when models are learned for agent control inputs as
opposed to positions, we propagate the moments of uncertain control inputs
through the nonlinear motion dynamics to obtain the exact moments of uncertain
position over the planning horizon. To this end, we construct deterministic
linear dynamical systems that govern the exact time evolution of the moments of
uncertain position in the presence of uncertain control inputs. The presented
methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from DNNs trained on the
Argoverse and CARLA datasets and are shown to be effective for rapidly
assessing the probability of low probability events.",arxiv
