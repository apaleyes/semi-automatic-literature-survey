"Much American electoral and policy debate now centers on how best to reignite the nation’s economic dynamism and rebuild its competitive strength. Any such undertaking presents an extraordinary challenge, demanding a correspondingly extraordinary institutional response. This Article proposes precisely such a response. It designs and advocates a new public instrumentality--a National Investment Authority (“NIA”)--charged with the critical task of devising and implementing a comprehensive long-term development strategy for the United States.
Patterned in part after the New Deal-era Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in part after modern sovereign wealth funds, and in part after private equity and venture capital firms, the NIA is an inherently hybrid, public-private entity that combines the unique strengths of public instrumentalities--their vast scale, lengthy investment horizons, and explicit backing by the public’s full faith and credit--with the micro-informational advantages of private market actors. By creatively adapting familiar tools of financial and legal engineering, the NIA overcomes obstacles that ordinarily impede or discourage private investment in critically necessary and even transformative public infrastructure goods. By channeling presently speculative private capital back into the real economy, moreover, the NIA plays an important role in enhancing the resilience and stability of the U.S. and global financial systems.
The Article makes original contributions not only to contemporary policy debates over how to revive America’s productive prowess and bring its financial system back into the service of the real economy, but also to current theoretical understandings of “public goods,” “market failures,” and how to provide or address them. It offers an account of what it calls “collective goods”--a broader category than orthodox public goods--as solutions to collective action problems that pervade decentralized markets, hence as goods that can be supplied only through exercises of collective agency. Our NIA proposal operationalizes this theoretical insight by elaborating a specific institutional form that such collective agency can take",,https://core.ac.uk/download/223116034.pdf,64090410,private wealth and public goods: a case for a national investment authority,2018-04-01T08:00:00,Scholarship@Cornell Law: A Digital Repository,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"Treball desenvolupat en el marc del programa ""European Project Semester"".Traffic congestion is a significant problem which affects smoothness in transportation in many cities around the world. It is unavoidable due to increasing numbers of vehicles and overuse of roads in large and growing metropolises. Although, there are several policies that are implemented to reduce traffic congestion, such as improvement of public transport, car and motorcycle restriction on several roads, and an even-odd license plate policy, the major problem involves getting data in order to predict and avoid traffic. Information can be collected from many sources such as: city sensors, GPS, as well as, from many application programming interfaces (API) provided by different companies. The project involves gathering sources and information about traffic congestion in order to create guidelines which can be essential in creating a traffic map of Vilanova i la Geltrú in the future. Eventually, the guidelines to the city of Vilanova i la Geltrú are provided, consisting of analysis of traffic inside the city, IoT management, choices of APIs, effective selection of sensors, and cost analysis to vastly improve traffic flow.Incomin",,https://core.ac.uk/download/512036021.pdf,133478829,fuzz sensoring,2021-06-08T01:00:00,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"Infrastructure is all around us: under, above, even inside our built and natural landscapes. Sometimes hidden, sometimes visible. The flows that course through them make our cities, economies, and lives possible. Cities could not even exist without infrastructure. Life is endowed with more possibilities by infrastructure. The centrality of infrastructure is pervasive. Worldwide, cities embrace infrastructure for economic competitiveness, well-being, access, environmental protection and knowledge creation. As cities are crucibles that concentrate the human condition, infrastructures are conduits that enable that concentration and empower human achievement. As infrastructures shape almost every aspect of daily life, this article assays the various ways it currently makes places both less sustainable and resilient, as well as more so, and how we can minimise the former and optimise the latter",10.3390/su12208308,https://core.ac.uk/download/334952622.pdf,8388042,infrastructure is key to make cities sustainable,2020-01-01T00:00:00,'MDPI AG',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"This dissertation is a study of four 21st century Arabic novels translated to English, each of which narrates a regionally specific process of state-sanctioned property theft. I argue that the authors of these novels use and subvert conventions from genres of fiction such as the Gothic, detective fiction, and science fiction to counter the logics of state power represented in each novel. The first chapter studies Abdo Khal's Tarmi bi Sharar (Throwing Sparks 2009), which uses Gothic conventions such as monstrosity and narrative frames to challenge the logic of authoritarian impunity that drives property theft in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The second chapter analyzes Raja Alem's Tawq al-Hamam (The Dove's Necklace 2010), which counters the elitist individualism at the root of conventional detective fiction with a community of detective-like characters who investigate gentrification in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The third chapter examines Ahmed Naji's Istikhdam al-Haya (Using Life 2014) for how science fiction tropes of utopia and dystopia offer imaginative tools to rethink the logics of progress and sustainability used to justify green gentrification in Cairo, Egypt. And the fourth chapter reads Ahmed Saadawi's Frankenstein in Baghdad (2014) for how orality and polyphonic narration counter the logics of security and exceptionalism that drive the U.S. occupation of Baghdad and the Iraqi state's theft of property left behind by the displaced and the deceased.Includes bibliographical references",10.32469/10355/93961,https://core.ac.uk/download/568399392.pdf,145434131,spatial politics and genre in the 21st century arabic novel in english,,'University of Missouri Libraries',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"This paper is the first work to perform spatio-temporal mapping of human
activity using the visual content of geo-tagged videos. We utilize a recent
deep-learning based video analysis framework, termed hidden two-stream
networks, to recognize a range of activities in YouTube videos. This framework
is efficient and can run in real time or faster which is important for
recognizing events as they occur in streaming video or for reducing latency in
analyzing already captured video. This is, in turn, important for using video
in smart-city applications. We perform a series of experiments to show our
approach is able to accurately map activities both spatially and temporally. We
also demonstrate the advantages of using the visual content over the

"In this manifesto, we make the case that Exercise Science can and must do more to improve the health of the public and the planet. Post pandemic, our vision for Exercise Science is one of a maturing scientific discipline reaching outwards from a base of strong empirical evidence to have a profound and sustained positive global impact on health. In each of the three main areas of the discipline–research, teaching, and professional practice–a new and distinctive approach is needed. We propose 12 points of action, in no particular order, for a). quality, rigour, and professional standing, and b). reach, relevance, and public engagement and make numerous suggestions for action and change. We encourage the teachers, researchers and practitioners of Exercise Science to consider and act on these recommendations. We hope that this manifesto can help create a shared sense of purpose amongst the global Exercise Science community and further the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion. To act on these principles, we need to cultivate a discipline that encourages more women, people who experience racism and other forms of discrimination, and people with a disability to become involved in the discipline",10.1080/02640414.2022.2049083,https://core.ac.uk/download/492527618.pdf,18818590,a manifesto for exercise science–a vision for improving the health of the public and planet,2022-01-01T00:00:00,'Informa UK Limited',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"The purpose of this report is to share lessons from an international research workshop dedicated to post- automation. Twenty-seven researchers from eleven different countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe, met at the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University on 11-13 September 2019, where we discussed empirical research papers and explored post-automation in group activities. We write this report primarily for researchers, but also for activists and policy advisors looking for more imaginative approaches to governing technology, work and sustainability in society, compared to those dominant agendas adapting automatically to the interests behind automation.

The report is structured as follows. Section two introduces the workshop topic and papers presented, and which leads into two related areas that became a focus for discussion. First, some challenges in the foundations

of automation theory (section three). And second, post-automation as a more constructive proposition to the challenges of automation, and that is happening right now (section four). Section five summarises some key points arising from the workshop, based on empirical observations from the margins of digital technology development, and that give both a flavour of the workshop and help elaborate the post-automation proposition. Some analytical and strategic themes are discussed in section six. We conclude in section seven with proposals for a post-automation agenda",,https://core.ac.uk/download/305117901.pdf,8038296,post-automation: report from an international workshop,2020-04-05T00:00:00,Science Policy Research Unit,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"This paper addresses ways in which artists and cultural practitioners have recently                been using forms of urban exploration as a means of engaging with, and intervening                in, cities. It takes its cues from recent events on the streets of New York that                involved exploring urban spaces through artistic practices. Walks, games,                investigations and mappings are discussed as manifestations of a form of                ‘psychogeography’, and are set in the context of recent                increasing international interest in practices associated with this term, following                its earlier use by the situationists. The paper argues that experimental modes of                exploration can play a vital role in the development of critical approaches to the                cultural geographies of cities. In particular, discussion centres on the political                significance of these spatial practices, drawing out what they have to say about two                interconnected themes: ‘rights to the city’ and                ‘writing the city’. Through addressing recent cases of                psychogeographical experimentation in terms of these themes, the paper raises broad                questions about artistic practices and urban exploration to introduce this theme                issue on ‘Arts of urban exploration’ and to lead into the                specific discussions in the papers that follow",10.1191/1474474005eu347oa,https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/document/23257/1/ssoar-cultgeo-2005-4-pinder-arts_of_urban_exploration.pdf,24519849,arts of urban exploration,2011-03-01T07:22:00,'SAGE Publications',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

Publisher Copyright: © 2022 Owner/Author.Understanding economic development and designing government policies requires accurate and timely measurements of socioeconomic activities. In this paper, we show how to leverage city structural information and urban imagery like satellite images and street view images to accurately predict multi-level socioeconomic indicators. Our framework consists of four steps. First, we extract structural information from cities by transforming real-world street networks into city graphs (GeoStruct). Second, we design a contrastive learning-based model to refine urban image features by looking at geographic similarity between images, with images that are geographically close together having similar features (GeoCLR). Third, we propose using street segments as containers to adaptively fuse the features of multi-view urban images, including satellite images and street view images (GeoFuse). Finally, given the city graph with a street segment as a node and a neighborhood area as a subgraph, we jointly model street- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic indicator predictions as node and subgraph classification tasks. The novelty of our method is that we introduce city structure to organize multi-view urban images and model the relationships between socioeconomic indicators at different levels. We evaluate our framework on the basis of real-world datasets collected in multiple cities. Our proposed framework improves performance by over 10% when compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and recall.Peer reviewe",10.1145/3511808.3557153,https://core.ac.uk/download/558722480.pdf,141097612,predicting multi-level socioeconomic indicators from structural urban imagery,2022-10-17T01:00:00,Association for Computing Machinery,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"Accurate air quality forecasting is crucial for public health, environmental
monitoring and protection, and urban planning. However, existing methods fail
to effectively utilize multi-scale information, both spatially and temporally.
Spatially, there is a lack of integration between individual monitoring
stations and city-wide scales. Temporally, the periodic nature of air quality
variations is often overlooked or inadequately considered. To address these
limitations, we present a novel Multi-spatial Multi-temporal air quality
forecasting method based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Gated Recurrent
Units (M2G2), bridging the gap in air quality forecasting across spatial and
temporal scales. The proposed framework consists of two modules: Multi-scale
Spatial GCN (MS-GCN) for spatial information fusion and Multi-scale Temporal
GRU(MT-GRU) for temporal information integration. In the spatial dimension, the
MS-GCN module employs a bidirectional learnable structure and a residual
structure, enabling comprehensive information exchange between individual
monitoring stations and the city-scale graph. Regarding the temporal dimension,
the MT-GRU module adaptively combines information from different temporal
scales through parallel hidden states. Leveraging meteorological indicators and
four air quality indicators, we present comprehensive comparative analyses and
ablation experiments, showcasing the higher accuracy of M2G2 in comparison to
nine currently available advanced approaches across all aspects. The
improvements of M2G2 over the second-best method on RMSE of the 24h/48h/72h are
as follows: PM2.5: (7.72%, 6.67%, 10.45%); PM10: (6.43%, 5.68%, 7.73%); NO2:

This paper is the outcome of a visioning exercise carried out in a 2-day workshop, attended by 33 young early career professionals under the auspices of IPBES. The process used Nature Futures Framework in an adapted visioning method from the Seeds of Good Anthropocene project. Four groups envisioned more desirable future worlds; where humanity has organised itself, the economy, politics and technology, to achieve improved nature-human well-being. The four visions had differing conceptualisations of this future. However, there were interesting commonalities in their leverage points for transformative change, including an emphasis on community, fundamentally different economic systems based on sharing and technological solutions to foster sustainability and human-nature connectedness. Debates included questioning the possibility of maintaining local biocultural diversity with increased connectivity globally and the prominence of technology for sustainability outcomes.

"This paper examines the latest development of capitalism called cognitive capitalism and its characteristics that differentiate it from the industry-based society through literary science fiction, more specifically, the alternative history novel The Difference Engine. This novel is examined within the framework of Moulier-Boutang’s theory of cognitive capitalism for signs of economic, social and technological trends, such as social inclusion in economic production of value, free access to information and networking. Furthermore, contradictory effects of information propriety and endangered privacy of individuals are explored. Much of the issues of cognitive capitalism identified by Moulier-Boutang are present in the work of Sterling and Gibson. The increasing informatization of the society and economy are depicted as causing the extinction of certain small businesses, and the booming of mass media and the entertainment sector as evidenced by the importance of computerized cinema theatres in London. The convenience of information access has rendered much of the urban population indifferent to the privacy-intruding computerized surveillance. Furthermore, the disenchanted masses of unemployed who are not included in the new economy (which constitutes a cognitive capitalism contradiction to its policy of horizontal distribution of labor) feel alienated by the society and instigate a rebellion amidst the environmental disaster in the city (a negative economic externality affecting the biosphere) against the perceived oppressiveness of the regime. Finally, the computer-controlled system is constantly evolving to the point of removing human influence from the decision-making loop. With these points of convergence of today’s economy and yesterday’s fiction we turn towards the United States, particularly its South which is argued to be the cradle of modern day neoliberalism. In this short outline of neoliberal origins it is established that the regional economic interests of the South have superseded the social welfare inclination of the US as a whole and took the lead not just in the country but also in the rest of the world. In the end, the conclusion is that science-fiction, or

The Difference Engine in particular did not really try hard to predict the future of society but it merely reflected the changes that were already underway at the time of the writing (Reagan-era America and Margaret Thatcher UK). This in turn means that the rapid transformation of the ways in which capitalism operates is nothing new. The advancement of technology makes it more flexible and this enables it to negotiate its position with consumer society by offering convenience and instant communication in exchange for economic exploitation of privacy. In other words, generation of profit and production of value are the same end goals that they have always been",,https://core.ac.uk/download/299372432.pdf,10653690,američki kapitalizam i znanstvena fantastika,2016-01-01T00:00:00,,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"Architecture is not only that which is built. Architecture is made up of different aspects, both material and immaterial. The atmosphere, the sounds, the smells, the possibility of interaction between human bodies: these all constitute characteristics of space, characteristics that are assuming an increasing importance within architectural research worldwide. Within this field of thought about “Architecture Beyond Building”, we focus on one particular non-material spatial phenomenon that lies ‘beyond the built’: sound. We have created, thus, an interactive sonic map of Athens, which presents, in an unexpected way, fragments of the atmosphere of the city. What would a non-visual map look like? What would it feel like if you wandered within a forest of headphones, playing sounds from different places in Athens? How would it feel if you found yourself in a ‘map’ that only appeared when you walked in it? What would it be like if the map only appeared when you invited one more person to be with you? The Greek pavilion addresses these questions through an atmospheric interactive ‘game’, presenting fragments of sounds and visual sequences of Athens. The visitor recreates the space around him through his own presence and movement. The map appears only where he walks, and/or when he invites one more person to sit next to him. The bodies of the visitors react with one another and with the space itself, creating a dynamic, changing field. This walk in the pavilion takes you “out there”, through invisible Athens. The pavilion brings forth the aspects of architecture that are ‘beyond the material’: the ‘beyond the built’, the almost unreachable, elusive aspects of space, such as sound, non-visual senses, atmosphere. It challenges, thus, the limits of architecture, the limits of what can be mapped and re-located and what cannot. An edited collection by A. Karandinou, C. Achtypi, S.

"Recent activity in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. These are undoubtedly impressive achievements, but they raise serious questions about appropriation, accuracy, explainability, accessibility, responsibility, and more. There have been pusillanimous and self-exculpating calls for a halt in development by senior researchers in the field and largely self-serving comments by industry leaders around the potential of AI systems, good or bad. Many of these commentaries leverage misguided conceptions, in the popular imagination, of the competence of machine intelligence, based on some sort of Frankenstein or Terminator-like fiction: however, this leaves it entirely unclear what exactly the relationship between human(ity) and AI, as represented by LLMs or what comes after, is or could be",10.1109/mts.2023.3341463,https://core.ac.uk/download/598038913.pdf,153419090,the stuff we swim in: regulation alone will not lead to justifiable trust in ai,2024-01-22T00:00:00,,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'
"Im Zentrum der ideenpolitischen Bemühungen, die die japanischen Eliten der Meiji-Ära (1868– 1912) unternahmen, um das Land in modernem Gewand, doch auf traditionellen Grundlagen zur Nation zu formen, standen der Tennō-Kult und die allgemeine staatliche Pflichtschule. Zwischen der Verabschiedung der Verfassung des Kaiserlichen Japan im Jahr 1889 und dem Erlass des Kaiserlichen Erziehungs-Edikts im Jahr 1890 bestand insofern ein enger politisch-ideeller Zusammenhang. Der Artikel verfolgt die konflikthaften Auseinandersetzungen, die im letzten Drittel des 19. Jahrhunderts zwischen den Verteidigern altjapanischer Bildungstradition und den Anhängern westlicher Aufklärung, zwischen konfuzianischen Intellektuellen und westlich orientierten Demokraten, ausgetragen wurden. Er entwickelt vor diesem Hintergrund die weder selbstverständliche noch einlinige Genese der normativen Grundlagen des modernen Japan. Die Autoren beschreiben die wechselnden Inszenierungen, die in diesem Zusammenhang dem Tennō zuteil wurden: von seiner anfänglichen Rolle als öffentlich sichtbarem Symbol der Einheit der Nation (auf landesweiten Rundreisen oder Militärparaden) über den völligen Rückzug hinter die Palastmauern (in Konsequenz seiner Sakralisierung durch den erstarkenden Staats-Shintō) hin zu seiner indirekten Rückkehr in den öffentlichen Raum (in Form eines hochstilisierten und kultisch verehrten Konterfeis).

"Mindful Wandering is an inspiring blend of memoir, travelogue, and environmental manifesto. As a translational ecologist, Rebecca Romsdahl is trained to ask critical questions about how we can improve our human relationships with the natural world for a sustainable, resilient future. As a farmgirl, she learned how to observe nature and life through the changing seasons. In this collection of essays spanning two decades, Romsdahl weaves these ideas together as she travels our changing world. From a Minnesota farm to the mountains of Peru and the edge of the Sahara Desert, she explores strategies for sustainability and resilience, and advocates that we (especially those of us privileged enough to travel) must expand our mindful considerations to include all the other inhabitants of this beautiful Earth. Romsdahl practices, and preaches, mindful wandering to reduce her impacts on the natural environment, and to encourage us all to be better global citizens. She implores us, through the eyes of a farmgirl scientist, to ask soul-searching questions: How do we reconnect with the local, seasonal rhythms of life, while learning how to care about the whole Earth as our home?

"This dissertation reconceives curriculum through an historical approach that employs Ludwig Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. Curriculum is more than the knowledge taught in school. Curriculum, as I a theorist conceives it, is concerned with the broader intellectual and ideological ways a society thinks about education. Hence, the current school curriculum’s focus on specific learning outcomes offers a limited view of the knowledge fashioned by a society, thereby offering an intellectual and social history that is highly selective. Wittgenstein’s concept of “language-games” offers curricularists a way to re-include some of these stories. The concept of curriculum emerges at the end of the Renaissance from Peter Ramus’s refinement of the art of dialectic into a pedagogical method of logic. The modern curriculum field arose at the end of the nineteenth century as educators sought to further refine the remnants of scholasticism’s pedagogical practices by employing “social efficiency” and scientific management to more effectively organize American education. Social efficiency and scientific management became the underlying premises of Ralph Tyler’s (1949) rationalization of the school curriculum. During the nineteen seventies, curriculum theorists began disrupting Tyler’s rational foundations by reconceptualizing curriculum using philosophies and theories developed outside of education to alter the language used to describe education. I use Wittgenstein’s later philosophy to further disrupt the school curriculum’s rational underpinnings. Wittgenstein maintains that knowing does not require some internal or external authority, thereby rejecting the empirical and logical foundations of knowledge that underlie Western education. Using a Wittgenstein approach suggests that education is an indirect activity of teaching students the use of words. Wittgenstein suggests that educating students indirectly more closely resemble the kinds of playful activities in which children engage in their ordinary lives. He suggests that learning is a synoptic presentation that connects concepts that emerge from our everyday use of language in new and interesting ways. By asking students to see the resemblances among concepts synoptically, rather than logically, education cannot be reduced to the acquisition of a set of facts, ordered in a sequence of steps. As such, a Wittgensteinian approach reconceives curriculum as an act of language-play",10.31390/gradschool_dissertations.495,https://core.ac.uk/download/217400076.pdf,63372328,reconceiving curriculum:  an historical approach,2002-01-01T08:00:00,LSU Digital Commons,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"Chapter 5 in Cultural-historical perspectives on collective intelligence

In the era of digital communication, collective problem solving is increasingly important. Large groups can now resolve issues together in completely different ways, which has transformed the arts, sciences, business, education, technology, and medicine. Collective intelligence is something we share with animals and is different from machine learning and artificial intelligence. To design and utilize human collective intelligence, we must understand how its problem-solving mechanisms work. From democracy in ancient Athens, through the invention of the printing press, to COVID-19, this book analyzes how humans developed the ability to find solutions together. This wide-ranging, thought-provoking book is a game-changer for those working strategically with collective problem solving within organizations and using a variety of innovative methods. It sheds light on how humans work effectively alongside machines to confront challenges that are more urgent than what humanity has faced before. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.Chapter 5 argues that the origins of human swarm problem solving can be traced back to group hunting which required rapid problem solving during the hunt, but also planning activities. Collective actions build on synchronization in the sense that every contribution from individual hunters mattered. Another milestone was the emergence of premodern trade, which enabled human groups to utilize informational diversity from non-kin and even strangers. Knowledge was shared in new ways through large gatherings and trade networks. The third major achievement was the establishment of the first democracy in ancient Athens with institutions such as the Assembly of the People, the Council of 500 and the People`s Court. These institutions let a large number of individuals engage in rapid problem solving in a formalized manner. Individuals from all over the Athenian territory met in the city to solve societal problems. These historical examples show that human swarm problem solving is also a story about our ability to solve problems in increasingly larger groups.publishedVersio",10.1017/9781108981361.005,https://core.ac.uk/download/539602227.pdf,127010688,the origins of human swarm problem solving,2022-01-01T00:00:00,'Cambridge University Press (CUP)',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"There can be a tendency in art-science projects for science discourses to instrumentalise arts practices, and for arts discourses to instrumentalise science practices, rather than for each to rigorously challenge and inform the other. 

The Chancellor’s Fund Green-Blue-Grey Campus/Rain Garden project was an attempt to get beyond this limiting instrumentalisation, and to explore new ways of working across the art-science interface in which dialogue can be generated and knowledge produced across diverse discourses, practices, communities and identities. It used innovative art, science and participatory research methodologies to explore, devise and test strategies for successfully integrating green-blue infrastructure in an urban design context, with specific reference to the sustainable design feature of the rain garden in the ongoing University of Glasgow campus redevelopment. 

 

This report introduces the Green-Blue-Grey Campus/Rain Garden project, summarises the aims and methods used, and the principle findings generated, before contextualising the work in the broader fields. It then takes a closer look at the art-science methods used, and shares some of the strategies developed.

"The purpose of this book is to provide a broadbased understanding of the rapidly changing environment of campus telecommunications. The anticipated audience for this material is the non-technical university administrator who may not have direct responsibility for telecommunications, but has a need to understand the general environment in which his telecommunications manager functions and the basic concepts of the technology. Five topic areas were selected that best cover the preponderance of issues. No attempt has been made to associate or closely coordinate materials from one chapter\u27s subject to that of any other. Each chapter generally stands alone. In total, however, the five chapters address the topics and issues that most often generate inquiries from university administrators outside the telecommunications department.

"Online tracking is the key enabling technology of modern online advertising. In the recently established model of real-time bidding (RTB), the web pages tracked by ad platforms are shared with advertising agencies (also called DSPs), which, in an auction-based system, may bid for user ad impressions. Since tracking data are no longer confined to ad platforms, RTB poses serious risks to privacy, especially with regard to user profiling, a practice that can be conducted at a very low cost by any DSP or related agency, as we reveal here. In this work, we illustrate these privacy risks by examining a data set with the real ad-auctions of a DSP, and show that for at least 55% of the users tracked by this agency, it paid nothing for their browsing data. To mitigate this abuse, we propose a system that regulates the distribution of bid requests (containing user tracking data) to potentially interested bidders, depending on their previous behavior. In our approach, an ad platform restricts the sharing of tracking data by limiting the number of DSPs participating in each auction, thereby leaving unchanged the current RTB architecture and protocols. However, doing so may have an evident impact on the ad platform’s revenue. The proposed system is designed accordingly, to ensure the revenue is maximized while the abuse by DSPs is prevented to a large degree. Experimental results seem to suggest that our system is able to correct misbehaving DSPs, and consequently enhance user privacy.Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft",10.1016/j.engappai.2019.03.013,https://core.ac.uk/download/200845411.pdf,58983389,on the regulation of personal data distribution in online advertising platforms,2019-03-01T00:00:00,'Elsevier BV',"[{'title': 'Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence', 'identifiers': ['issn:0952-1976', '0952-1976']}]",core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"traduction anglaise Travis BruceGoverning Empire is a study, accompanied by a re-edition and a French translation, of maǧmūʿ Yaḥyá, the "" compendium of Yaḥyá "", manuscript 4752 in the Library ḥasaniyya in Rabat. This little volume, the surviving copy of which dates from the 16th-17th centuries, reproduces a formulary composed in the late 13th century by Yaḥyá al-Ḫaḏūǧ, a man of letters living at the time of the demise of the Almohad Empire in 1269. It contains 77 acts of appointment of provincial officials, governors, military chiefs, chiefs of Arab tribes, tax-collectors and judges, written between 1224 and 1269. Of this total, 73 acts (two of them identical) concern the Almohad Empire, especially the Maghrebian part, and four concern the anti-Almohad principality of Ibn Hūd al-Mutawakkil of Murcia (r. 1228-1238) in the Iberian Peninsula. The acts reproduced by Yaḥyá belong to the highly codified genre of chancery literature. Written most frequently in rhyming prose (saǧʿ) and intended for proclamation in the great mosques of the Empire, they obey rules of composition and follow rhetorical, syntactical and linguistic procedures which place them --as the compiler asserts-- in the sphere of the adab, that is literature, or more generally the culture of the ""man of good breeding"". Partaking of poetry, sermon, oratory, normative literature and religious discourse, the appointments reproduced there are the expression of a sovereign order, the Almohad imperial order, or the anti-Almohad order of the Hūdi principality of Murcia. Set down in writing and rendered anonymous through the quasi-systematic deletion of proper names, toponyms and dates, these acts were neutralized for the use of successive specialists in the language of power. Performative as they were, they came to be accepted as models and thus were absorbed into the ever-growing thesaurus of reference texts. This pragmatic collection is the last vestige of the most important indigenous authority in the history of the Maghreb. Governing Empire begins by retracing the political history of the Almohad Empire and the stages through which a territory and an authority were built up. It recalls the ideological, political and religious foundations which made Ibn Tūmart possible to unify the Maghreb and al-Andalus in the mid-12th century in the service of a dynasty of Berber origin. ʿAbd al-Mu'min (r. 1130-1162) and his descendants, the Mu'minids, mobilised the strength of the tribes of the time, Berber and Arab, to impose a dogma devised by the greatest of contemporary thinkers. Living witnesses of the islamization and arabization of the Maghreb, this dynasty resolved to reorganize the structures of power and authority to its own advantage. The Almohad sovereigns, who had assumed the title of Caliph in consonance with their pretension to guide all the peoples of Islam (umma), in the manner of the Muʿtazilite in 9th-century Iraq, claimed for themselves the authority to interpret divine law. To that end, jurists and wise men were separated from the interpretative process that the Malikite school had reserved to them since the 9th century, and they were reduced to judicial tasks or enrolled in the chancery services. The literature that the chancery produced, of which the manuscript presented, re-edited and translated here is one of the fundamental examples, plainly reveals this reversal of the relationships of authority between the religious knowledge of the ulemas and the political power of the caliphs. The organization of the ""compendium of Yaḥyá"", which is presented in the second part, throws light on the original ideological concepts predominating at the close of the Almohad era: thus, military and fiscal functions, which belong to the political order --governors, army generals, admirals of the fleet and tax collectors-- are clearly set apart from the judicial functions pertaining to the judges. Law-making devolved upon the sovereign, the sole authorized interpreter of divine law as embodied in the Qur'an and Tradition. The task of creating positive law thus rested entirely with the Caliph-imām, heir to the founder of the Almohad movement, Ibn Tūmart (d. 1130) -- the guide inspired by God, ""impeccable imām and acknowledged Mahdī"". The tasks assigned to the appointed functionaries, the counsels and orders given them, and the instructions addressed to subjects, all clearly reflect the organic conception of society and of imperial authority that characterized the Almohad ideology. That ideology was revolutionary inasmuch as it clearly departed from functionalist approaches, like that implicit in the al-Aḥkām al-Sulṭāniyya wa l-Wilāyat al-Dīniyya (""The Ordinances of Government"") of al-Māwardī (d. 1058). The careful edition and the French translation of Yaḥyá's formulary in the third part of Governing Empire give a good idea of the breadth of literary talent demanded of chancery secretaries, veritable craftsmen of language, simply to produce the decrees of power. The infinite stylistic and lexical variations combine adherence to rigid codes of chancery language with the kind of poetic and rhetorical innovations characteristic of great works of literature. This work on the language of power, at once laborious and skilled, bureaucratic and poetic, puts a voice to a specific authority --the authority of the Almohad caliphs, rooted in a particular time and place: the 13th-century Maghreb. The posthumous compilation of these performative utterances abstracts the language of power and sets Almohad history, dogma and order in the context of the corpus of timeless Islamic authorities. This formulary thus affords a glimpse of the specific nature of and the role played by administrative archives in the mediaeval Muslim world and throws light on the exceptional intricacy of Islamic imperial bureaucracies as exemplified by their chancery, the dīwān al-inšā', literally the ""bureau of creation""",10.1163/9789004239715,https://core.ac.uk/download/31525893.pdf,19480457,"governing the empire. provincial administration in the almohad caliphate (1224-1269): critical edition, translation, and study of manuscript 4752 of the ḥasaniyya library in rabat containing 77 taqādīm (""appointments"")",2012-01-01T00:00:00,'Brill',[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"Human beings are social animals, not solitary ones. Morality is an instinct we have because it helps us socialize, live together harmoniously. This paper reviews how the evolution of morality and other mental functions associated with our survival and sociality gave rise to cultural behavior among the small groups of humans during the Palaeolithic period when the tribe was personified as a supernatural identity and guardian, a totem, an ancestor and ultimately a god. Loyalty to the tribe required loyalty to the tribal god representing the tribe. Preservation of the tribe meant mistrust of other tribes and their gods. The merging of small groups rendered obsolete the tribal, locally cultural conception of religion, but it persisted as monotheism in the imperial stage of society from about 2000 BC, becoming the world religions. Today’s empires are global, and a belief system modelled on local tribes in competition is naïve divisive. Out-group hatred is more of a threat than any in-group moral benefits, and they too are disappearing with the failure to preserve small group coherence, and justice and fairness in capitalist society. The moral failure of imperial religion on the urban and global scale is the “Death of God”. Humans now cannot afford the moral laziness of constantly appealing to a supernatural totem in an otherwise do-nothing religion. Imperial religion was and still is a tool of the political right, used to manipulate us. Yet Christ offered an ethical scheme that is essentially a practical morality of mutual lovingkindness which does not require a supernatural God.

"The concern of the Catholic Church in this century and the immediate past centuries has been how the faithful will effectively internalize and role-play the Gospel in their life. The implication of this concern for the Catholic Church is rooted in the inter-cultural and counter-cultural encounter between Christianity and any of the cultures in question, and at this point the African Culture in Abakaliki diocese. To negotiate a complexity of this magnitude, one cannot ignore its rhetorical ripples around the individual, culture, Church family and the society at large.
The Christian culture must be translated to the language the people being evangelized must understand. The Gospel will have to take an incarnate nature among the people in order for them to role-play it in their life. Therefore, the significance of Augustine\u27s rhetorical theory in addressing a complexity of this kind is invaluable as a theoretical basis to launch a process of action. Augustine strongly upholds the role of caritas (love) which demands communication and eventually becomes the source whereby we can overcome ambiguities in situations that are rhetorical in nature. Within the African context such ambiguities are resonate in the development of Catholic Christian ministry in a way that will more aggressively assimilate and adapt to the African (Abakaliki diocesan) society.
It must be acknowledged that the African society is already family and community oriented, where the role of the individual is paramount. These existing roles are forms of service to the community and may qualify for a ministry if interpreted in religious terms. Therefore how can collaborative ministry allow the birth of new ministries while addressing the needs of the Catholic Christian communities in Africa? The significance of collaborative ministry as recommended by the fathers during African Synod for the African Catholic Church, derives from the biblical sense of ministry indicative of Christ\u27s mandate to his followers, to go out to the whole world and proclaim the gospel (Holy Bible, Mk 16: 15); while assuring them  I am with you always, until the close of the age  (Holy Bible, Mt 28: 20). There is no exclusion in ministry",,https://core.ac.uk/download/234047423.pdf,69996795,the rhetoric of collaborative ministry: a perspective on ministry based on augustine\u27s rhetorical theory with particular reference to abakaliki diocese,2006-01-01T08:00:00,Duquesne Scholarship Collection,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"Crossing Cultures  by visual artist Thomas MacPherson is a graphic narrative spanning generations of two immigrant families: one Sicilian and one Scottish.
Unlike most Italian immigrants at the time the author’s family settled in small town America and struggled for acceptance while confronted with local prejudices. The book tells stories of hardships faced by a family at the boundaries of Italian and American cultures, and examines the intersection with German and Scottish Americans as the family married out of the circle of Sicilian immigrants.
Alongside the story of MacPherson’s Sicilian family is the MacPherson’s journey to assimilation and establishment of a dominant culture to which the new immigrants had to conform, and a look into the science of DNA and how genetic information brings light to the cultures of the two families.
These character studies are a compelling blend of oral history, direct observation, family photographs, original egg tempera and oil portrait paintings, and far-reaching historical events that shaped lives in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.https://knightscholar.geneseo.edu/geneseo-authors/1007/thumbnail.jp",,https://core.ac.uk/download/234028071.pdf,69985535,crossing cultures: a sicilian and american family in western new york,2016-01-01T08:00:00,KnightScholar,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"Born in 1874 the youngest daughter of a samurai and former daimyo—a feudal prince under the Takugawa shogunate—Etsu Inagaki grew up surrounded by ghosts of an aristocratic military lineage. Having fought on the losing side in the wars that installed the Meiji emperor, the ­Inagaki family was reduced in power, status, and wealth but not in pride or ­devotion to its traditional roles and customs. Etsu’s upbringing and education were conservative and old-fashioned, guided by the Shinto and Buddhist beliefs her family held. The samurai virtues of honor, ­stoicism, and sacrifice applied to daughters and wives as well as sons and fathers: “The eyelids of a samurai know not moisture.” Family turmoil, including her father’s death and the return of her prodigal brother, led her on another path—to an English-language mission school in Tokyo and an arranged marriage to a Japanese businessman in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she became mother to two daughters before being widowed and returning with them to Japan. Her story, as she tells it, is: “How a daughter of feudal Japan, living hundreds of years in one generation, became a modern American.” The clash of cultures, the momentous and sometimes hilarious misunderstandings between Japanese and Western ways are revealed in intriguing intimate episodes involving love, duty, and family ties. Living between a semi-mythical past and an emergent ­international present, Mrs. Sugimoto recounts the personal impact of the profound social changes brought about by Japanese-American relations during the Meiji period (1868–1912) and offers an unexpected insider’s view of traditional Japanese samurai family life as it is in the process of being swept away.

"Elizabeth B. Pinson shares with us her memories of Alaska\u27s emergence into a new and modern era, bearing witness to history in the early twentieth century as she recalls it. She draws us into her world as a young girl of mixed ethnicity, with a mother whose Eskimo family had resided on the Seward Peninsula for generations and a father of German heritage. Growing up in and near the tiny village of Teller on the Bering Strait, Elizabeth at the age of six, despite a harrowing, long midwinter sled ride to rescue her, lost both her legs to frostbite when her grandparents, with whom she was spending the winter in their traditional Eskimo home, died in the 1918 influenza epidemic.
Fitted with artificial legs financed by an eastern benefactor, Elizabeth kept journals of her struggles, triumphs, and adventures, recording her impressions of the changing world around her and experiences with the motley characters she met. These included Roald Amundsen, whose dirigible landed in Teller after crossing the Arctic Circle; the ill-fated 1921 British colonists of Wrangel Island in the Arctic; trading ship captains and crews; prospectors; doomed aviators; and native reindeer herders. Elizabeth moved on to boarding school, marriage, and the state of Washington, where she compiled her records into this memoir and where, now in her 90s, she lives.https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/1046/thumbnail.jp",,https://core.ac.uk/download/32550094.pdf,19062317,alaska\u27s daughter,1912-01-01T08:00:00,Utah State University Press,[],core,architecture,'architecture' AND ('generative ai' OR 'artificial intelligence') AND 'public sector' AND 'public value'

"“Latvian Grammar” was written to make information about the Latvian language and its grammatical system more easily available not only within Latvia, but also beyond its borders. A modern grammar of Latvian written in English is as important for native speakers of Latvian as for those who have learned Latvian as a second language and also is of great value for anyone interested in the culture and history of Latvia or the Latvian language itself. The need for a reference grammar of Latvian written in English is especially important right now due to the existence of a large Latvian diaspora community abroad, particularly in English-speaking countries where children and young people are educated in the language of their home countries rather than in Latvian. A Latvian grammar written in English will also be useful for those who are learning Latvian as a foreign language and wish to learn more about its grammatical system and unique features. Likewise, “Latvian grammar” will be a useful reference and source for examples for teachers of Latvian – both those who teach it to speakers as a school or university subject and those who teach it as a foreign language. There is also considerable demand among linguists abroad for a systematic and dependable description of Latvian written by native speakers of Latvian. Latvian is a rather unique combination of ancient as well as relatively new features, which are of interest to researchers abroad and are important for the typological, cognitive, pragmatic, functional, and contrastive analysis of language.University of Latvia
