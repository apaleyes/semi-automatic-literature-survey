The increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) services causes tremendous growth of the amount of produced data. These data must be effectively stored and retrieved by the IoT service providers. The solution is to access the data through application programming interfaces. The paper focuses on the problem of designing an effective data storage service for IoT, which will be available through the universal application programming interface. We propose and analyze eight variants of the distributed data storage service that differ in the database structure, that is, the hierarchical structure based on Data-Oriented Network Architecture or the flat structure based on distributed hash table, the type of stored records, and the memory management algorithm that decides about using cache or base memory. The proposed solutions have been evaluated in the comprehensive simulation studies. The obtained results confirmed the effectiveness of the preferred solution with Dynamic Routing Records stored in the cache memory. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Int. J. Netw.

In the ICN setting, data to be distributed can be cached by ICN routers anywhere and accessed arbitrarily by customers without data publishers' permission, which imposes new challenges when achieving data access control: (i) security: How can data publishers protect data confidentiality (either data cached by ICN routers or data accessed by authorized users) even when an authorized user's decryption key was revoked or compromised, and (ii) scalability: How can data publishers leverage ICN's promising features and enforce access control without complicated key management or extensive communication. This paper addresses these challenges by using the new proposed dual-phase encryption that uniquely combines the ideas from one-time decryption key, proxy re-encryption and all-or-nothing transformation, while still being able to leverage ICN's features. Our analysis and performance show that our solution is highly efficient and provable secure under the existing security model.",2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2015,2,filtered,citation

Many clean-slate designs of the content/data oriented network have emerged to adapt to these needs. Named Data Networking (also known as CCN) is one of these designs to address these limitations from the fundamental level by building network architecture around named data. In this paper, we identify five key features crucial to application design over Named Data Networking and take the voice conference system as an example to show how this features impact the application design significantly in detail. We identify three major challenges facing current voice conference system and illustrate how NDN could help to solve these challenges.

This new architecture brings both new problems to be solved and also natural solutions to existing problems. This paper investigates an intra-domain traffic engineering (TE) problem for an information-centric networking (ICN) architecture where a form of source routing is used as the forwarding mechanism. The TE goal is to maximise the residual capacity in the network so that the load is spread evenly. A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks. Allowing splittable flows means that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme can be used that has superior results when compared to existing constraint based routing schemes for flows that cannot be split. Consequently, this work demonstrates that the ICN architecture can simplify the given TE problem in a natural manner.",2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2012,4,filtered,citation

In essence, supporting efficient publish/subscribe requires data-oriented naming, efficient multicast, and in-network caching. Deployment of native IP-based multicast has failed, and overlay-based multicast systems are inherently inefficient. We surmise that scalable and efficient publish/subscribe will require substantial architectural changes, such as moving from endpoint-oriented systems to information-centric architectures.
 In this paper, we propose a novel multicast forwarding fabric, suitable for large-scale topic-based publish/subscribe. Due to very simple forwarding decisions and small forwarding tables, the fabric may be more energy efficient than the currently used ones. To understand the limitations and potential, we provide efficiency and scalability analysis via simulations and early measurements from our two implementations.

Our work towards this goal is set in a clean-slate architecture consisting of modular rendezvous, routing, and forwarding functions. In this paper we present the interdomain routing layer and its interplay with the other components of the system. The proposed system is built around two types of nodes: forwarding nodes and branching nodes. The forwarding nodes are optimized for throughput with no per-subscription state and no need to change passing packets, while branching nodes contain a large memory for caching and can make complex routing decisions. The amount of storage space and bandwidth can be independently scaled to suit the needs of each network. In the background, topology nodes perform load-balancing and configure routes in each domain using a two-dimensional addressing mechanism. The paths taken by packets adapt to the number of active subscribers to keep the amount of in-network state and latency low. A new data-oriented congestion control scheme is introduced, which takes into account the use of storage resources on-path and is fair to multicast flows.",ReArch '09,2009,8,filtered,citation

However, recent internet statistics show that content-oriented traffic (e.g. web pages, multimedia clips) becomes more and more dominant. Even though content-oriented networking has received increasing attention, there have been few comprehensive and quantitative studies on how to realize a content-oriented networking framework. In this paper, we focus on the operational issues of the new networking framework: (i) how to locate contents, (ii) how to deliver contents, and (iii) how to cache contents. There are two major infrastructure alternatives in substantiating these mechanisms: a tree and a distributed hash table (DHT). We carry out comprehensive simulation experiments to compare these alternatives in terms of content transfer latency, cache effectiveness, and failure resilience. I. I NTRODUCTION The Internet has evolved from a small-scale academic testbed into a crucial social infrastructure. For 40 years since its inception, the Internet has tried to accommodate new and unanticipated requirements. However, its rigid design based on TCP/IP, internet service providers’ exclusive control of networks and so on have ossified the Internet [6]. One of the Internet design principles that hinders the current Internet evolution is the host-oriented communications. That is, the early stage Internet applications, such as remote login, file transfer, and e-mail, focused strictly on host-to-host communications, where an end user explicitly directs his/her host to communicate with another host. Over the past several years, however, the vast majority of Internet usage has become data retrieval and service access [23], [3], [16] (i.e.,data-orientedusage), where an end user cares about contents 1 but is oblivious to or less aware of the host (or its location) [16]. For example, (i) many people often use search engines like Google from which they jump to the data or service page irrespective of the location in which the desired data/service resides, (ii) web intermediaries such as web caches and content delivery networks (CDNs) [18] transparently redirect web clients to a nearby copy of the requested data without contacting the original Web server, and (iii) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications enable users to search and 1In this paper, we use “data” and “contents” almost interchangeably. In the literature, “contents” often have more semantics than “data”. retrieve the data without making them know the location or identity of the host. The common viable contribution of search engines, web caching, CDNs, and P2P applications is that they all seek to support data-oriented applications. They improve the data availability, ease-of-use, performance, and scalability of applications by overcoming the limitations of the host-oriented principles of the legacy Internet by manipulating DNS naming and/or name resolution. In other words, they decouple content files from their locations (or hosts) using various techniques such as caching, replication with transparent request redirection, maintenance of a searching infrastructure, etc. [16]. Recently, lessons from these several application/servicedependent ad-hoc solutions, have motivated “clean-slate” efforts [1], [16], [10], termed data-oriented or content-centric networking, which strive to redesign the host-oriented Internet to accommodate more and more dominant data-oriented Internet usage at the architectural level. The essence of contentoriented networking lies in decoupling contents from the service host/location not at application levels, but at networking levels. That is, content-oriented networking shifts the focus from transmitting data between two hosts (or their locations) to delivering data via a content identifier 2. The content-oriented networking architecture is expected to (i) free application/service developers from re-inventing the necessary mechanisms, and (ii) provide scalable and efficient delivery of the requested contents. However, there have been few studies that how to substantiate the content-oriented networking infrastructure in terms of performance metrics. In order to address the operational issues that are missing in the recent architectural studies on content-oriented networking in the literature, this paper explores two alternatives for content-oriented network infrastructures: a hierarchical tree and a flat distributed hash table (DHT). Whether we choose a tree or a DHT for the infrastructure affects almost every aspect of network operations: name resolution, content delivery, caching, and so on. We will compare these two alternatives in terms of scalability, robustness, transfer latency thoroughly. 2As an example, the Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) [16] r places endpoint-based DNS by a new name resolution mechanism using flat, certifying names and name-based anycast primitives above the IP layer.",,2008,9,filtered,citation

In this paper, we start design whit this knowledge that one multiplier made of several adder and one divider made of several sub tractor. Therefore, if the fast adder or fast multiplier designed, performance will be improved. In this design, a circuit is designed in a manner that without a need for transforming numbers or letters from the given bases into binary bases, the multiplication of two numbers for the same base is done in that base. Reduction in the number of conversions in the calculating unit, causes reduction in the consumption power and an increase in the operating speed of the system.

These primitives form the foundation for code-reuse and data-oriented attacks. While various defenses against the former class of attacks have proven effective, mitigation of the latter remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify various shortcomings of the x86 architecture regarding memory isolation, and leverage virtualization to build an effective defense against data-oriented attacks. Our approach, called xMP, provides (in-guest) selective memory protection primitives that allow VMs to isolate sensitive data in user or kernel space in disjoint xMP domains. We interface the Xen altp2m subsystem with the Linux memory management system, lending VMs the flexibility to define custom policies. Contrary to conventional approaches, xMP takes advantage of virtualization extensions, but after initialization, it does not require any hypervisor intervention. To ensure the integrity of in-kernel management information and pointers to sensitive data within isolated domains, xMP protects pointers with HMACs bound to an immutable context, so that integrity validation succeeds only in the right context. We have applied xMP to protect the page tables and process credentials of the Linux kernel, as well as sensitive data in various user-space applications. Overall, our evaluation shows that xMP introduces minimal overhead for real-world workloads and applications, and offers effective protection against data-oriented attacks.",2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2020,12,filtered,citation

Motivation is the fact that on the one hand we face a shift to the usage of more and more mobile devices but on the other hand most services in the Internet still use a classic client-server-approach. Data is mainly produced at private devices today and put on centralized servers afterwards. This situation reflects the actual reality better: data is shared directly among users without the need of centralized sources. Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share.

Accessing contents and services require the mapping of what users care about to where the content is located. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm in networking and a future Internet architecture which treats content as the primitive decoupling location from identity, security and access to retrieve content by name. Together with built-in capabilities for caching content, multi-path communications, disruption tolerance and security, ICN is able to leverage advancements in technology to address the issues associated with the mismatch between today’s network use and network architecture. There are a number of ICN architectures, viz., Network of Information (NetInf), Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP), Data Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) and Content Centric Networking (CCN) being developed by researchers worldwide with the ultimate focus of replacing the current Internet. CCN, a ""Clean Slate"" architecture to ICN, uses new approaches to routing named content, achieving scalability, security and performance. Most computing devices of today (user devices as well as in the core network) are equipped with multiple networking interfaces and hence, have the ability to use multiple paths within or over different networks. The widest possible experience in using multi-path is mostly available in Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) based networks and the research done shows that multi-path routing can achieve robustness, load balancing, congestion reduction, low power consumption, and higher throughput. CCN, which has built-in capabilities to handle multiple networking attachments proposes two forwarding strategies, viz., the standard strategy which replicates network traffic into multiple paths and the best-face strategy which uses the discovered multiple paths one at a time, alternatively. However, these forwarding strategies do not exploit the full potential of CCN, especially the multi-path capability to improve performance in CCN based networks. The main objective of this thesis therefore, is to identify a set of mechanisms that capitalize on the multipath capability of CCN to improve the overall performance of user applications and the deployed networks.",,2015,18,filtered,citation

As a first study in 2008 revealed, energy consumption of such data centers is becoming a critical problem, since their power consumption is about to double every 5 years. However, a recently (2016) released follow-up study points out that this threatening trend was dramatically throttled within the past years, due to the increased energy efficiency actions taken by data center operators. Furthermore, the authors of the study emphasize that making and keeping data centers energy-efficient is a continuous task, because more and more computing power is demanded from the same or an even lower energy budget, and that this threatening energy consumption trend will resume as soon as energy efficiency research efforts and its market adoption are reduced. An important class of applications running in data centers are data management systems, which are a fundamental component of nearly every application stack. While those systems were traditionally designed as disk-based databases that are optimized for keeping disk accesses as low a possible, modern state-of-the-art database systems are main memory-centric and store the entire data pool in the main memory, which replaces the disk as main bottleneck. To scale up such in-memory database systems, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) hardware architectures are employed that face a decreased bandwidth and an increased latency when accessing remote memory compared to the local memory. In this thesis, we investigate energy awareness aspects of large scale-up NUMA systems in the context of in-memory data management systems. To do so, we pick up the idea of a fine-grained data-oriented architecture and improve the concept in a way that it keeps pace with increased absolute performance numbers of a pure in-memory DBMS and scales up on NUMA systems in the large scale. To achieve this goal, we design and build ERIS, the first scale-up in-memory data management system that is designed from scratch to implement a data-oriented architecture. With the help of the ERIS platform, we explore our novel core concept for energy awareness, which is Energy Awareness by Adaptivity. The concept describes that software and especially database systems have to quickly respond to environmental changes (i.e., workload changes) by adapting themselves to enter a state of low energy consumption. We present the hierarchically organized Energy-Control Loop (ECL), which is a reactive control loop and provides two concrete implementations of our Energy Awareness by Adaptivity concept, namely the hardware-centric Resource Adaptivity and the software-centric Storage Adaptivity. Finally, we will give an exhaustive evaluation regarding the scalability of ERIS as well as our adaptivity facilities.",,2017,19,filtered,citation

The performance results show that (a) this platform obtains a high throughput (usually in the order of millions of tick messages per second) and a sub-microsecond latency; (b) it fully executes data-dependent tasks through a data-driven execution; and (c) it implements a modular design approach for rapidly developing these data-crunching methods and QF research models.

Such network designs show the requirements of energy efficiency, availability, high performance, and data-aware intelligence. To meet these requirements, we adopt the information-centric networking (ICN) approach, where data are retrieved through names and in-network caching is utilized. However, as the typical existing ICN architectures, content centric network (CCN) cannot efficiently utilize the caches for data sharing because of the on-path caching strategy, and network of information (NetInf) demonstrates the resolution latency for data retrievals. To design an efficient and effective ICN architecture for big data sharing, we combine the strong points of CCN and NetInf, where information islands (IOIs) and management plane are utilized for direct data retrieval and global data discovery, respectively. We provide a reference architecture and propose an aggregatable name-based routing (ANBR), which can naturally enable consumers to retrieve the closest copy of information. In this network, each piece of data can be cached at one IOI at most once, which greatly improves the efficiency of cache usages. The consumers first try to retrieve the data in the local IOI, and then try to globally retrieve it from the closest IOI, holding the copy of the data if necessary. We investigate the impact from the key factor, IOI size, to the energy consumption of ANBR. It shows that energy consumption first decreases and then increases as the IOI size increases, and the optimized IOI size can be found for deployment. Furthermore, we study the relation between the optimized IOI size and the average retrieval times for the data. The result shows that the optimized IOI size increases as the average retrieval times increase.",IEEE Access,2015,23,filtered,citation

Hence, buildings implement building management systems (BMSs), which monitor, control, manage and analyze each of these components. However, current BMSs are incapable of managing a massive amount of data (big data) and therefore cannot extract knowledge or make intelligent decisions in quasi real time. In addition, there are serious limitations to integrating BMSs with other services since they generally use proprietary software. In this sense, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that allows one to build distributed systems and provide functionalities such as services to end users or other types of services. Therefore, an SOA has the great advantage of allowing the expansion of the functionalities of BMSs. In fact, there are several studies that address SOAs for building management. However, we have not found any description or systematic analysis in the literature that allows the development of a versatile and interoperable SOA focused on the energy efficiency of buildings and that can integrate massive data analysis features. For these reasons, this study seeks to fill this knowledge gap and, more specifically, to identify and analyze the various software requirements proposed in the literature and the characteristics of big data that allow for improving the energy efficiency of buildings.

Therefore, this study explores the role of application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing real-time, online, and historical energy data in the context of residential buildings and electric vehicles. Moreover, a layered architecture that employs APIs in big data is developed for district energy management towards providing energy information intelligence and support decision-making on energy sustainability in facilitating prosumption operations.

However, prior studies on energy sustainability has paid little attention on prosumer involvement and management. Likewise, the continuous growth of cities has increased data processing complexity. Consequently, processing and analysis of historical, online, and real-time streaming data from energy sensors and metering devices has become a major issue in smart cities. Therefore, this research aims to present an architecture based on big data to improve energy prosumption in smart community districts by applying enterprise architecture approach grounded on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). Accordingly, qualitative methodology is adopted to collect data by employing case study by focus group interview from two energy companies in Norway to preliminarily validate the architecture. Findings from the case studies was demonstrated in ArchiMate modeling language to evaluate the applicability of the architecture.

And yet, as it has been recently pointed out, “the value of data explodes when it can be linked with other data.” In this paper we present our vision for a global marketplace of analytics—either in the form of per-entity metrics or per-entity data, provided by globally accessible data management tasks— where a data scientist can pick and combine data at will in her data mining algorithms, possibly combining with her own data. The main idea is to use the dataframe, a popular data structure in R and Python. Currently, the columns of a dataframe contain computations or data found within the data infrastructure of the organization. We propose to extend the concept of a column. A column is now a collection of key-value pairs, produced anywhere by a remotely accessed program (e.g., an SQL query, a MapReduce job, even a continuous query.) The key is used for the outer join with the existing dataframe, the value is the content of the column. This whole process should be orchestrated by a set of well-defined, standardized APIs. We argue that the proposed architecture presents numerous challenges and could be beneficial for big data interoperability. In addition, it can be used to build mediation systems involving local or global columns.

Each system targets well a specific application area, reinforcing the belief that the era of one-size fits all has gone. Interoperability, systems' connectivity and high-level data models become once again the core of research initiatives. In this paper we present our vision for a layered architecture to support interoperability among different data management systems, generalized under the term data management entities (DMEs). DMEs range from JVMs running java programs to Hadoop systems employing complex MapReduce jobs to traditional RDBMS running SQL queries to stream engines and CEP scripts. The top layer consists of a universe of DMEs, communicating through a well defined http-like protocol: a DME transparently invokes another DME's data manipulation task, regardless task's nature. Communicating DMEs share/operate on a shared data object, a key-value set (KVS) - just a set of key-value pairs - which exists in the layer below and is referenced through a unique (internet-wide) address via a well-defined API. This layer serves as the transient common memory space for communicating DMEs and consists of globally addressable KVSs, organized in domains, sub-domains, etc. In a way, this approach constitutes a form of remote procedure call by reference (the KVS is the common reference). We argue that this architecture allows the construction of high level query languages and cost-based distributed query processing engines, involving completely heterogeneous data manipulation tasks. For example, we show that MapReduce evaluation algorithm and distributed relational query processing are just instances of the proposed architecture.

Such systems are driving innovative applications and services that improve the quality of life of citizens both socially and economically. Furthermore, autonomic communication, because of its decentralised approach to communication, is also being explored by the research community as an alternative to centralised control infrastructures for efficient management of large networks. This thesis studies one of the successful contributions in the autonomic communication research, the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN). CPN is a highly scalable adaptive routing protocol that allows for decentralised control in communication. Consequently, CPN has achieved significant successes, and because of the direction of research, we expect it to continue to find relevance. To investigate this hypothesis, we research new applications and contexts for CPN. This thesis first studies Information-Centric Networking (ICN), a future Internet architecture proposal. ICN adopts a data-centric approach such that contents are directly addressable at the network level and in-network caching is easily supported. An optimal caching strategy for an information-centric network is first analysed, and approximate solutions are developed and evaluated. Furthermore, a CPN inspired forwarding strategy for directing requests in such a way that exploits the in-network caching capability of ICN is proposed. The proposed strategy is evaluated via discrete event simulations and shown to be more effective in its search for local cache hits compared to the conventional methods. Finally, CPN is proposed to implement the routing system of an Emergency Cyber-Physical System for guiding evacuees in confined spaces in emergency situations.

In ICN, content -rather than hosts, like in IP-based design- plays the central role in the communications. This change from host-centric to content-centric has several significant advantages such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency, scalability, etc. One of the main design requirements for the ICN architectures -since the beginning of their design- has been strong security. 
Named Data Networking (NDN) (also referred to as Content-Centric Networking (CCN) or Data-Centric Networking (DCN)) is one of these architectures that are the focus of an ongoing research effort that aims to become the way Internet will operate in the future. Existing research into security of NDN is at an early stage and many designs are still incomplete. To make NDN a fully working system at Internet scale, there are still many missing pieces to be filled in. In this dissertation, we study the four most important security issues in NDN in order to defense against new forms of -potentially unknown- attacks, ensure privacy, achieve high availability, and block malicious network traffics belonging to attackers or at least limit their effectiveness, i.e., anomaly detection, DoS/DDoS attacks, congestion control, and cache pollution attacks. In order to protect NDN infrastructure, we need flexible, adaptable and robust defense systems which can make intelligent -and real-time- decisions to enable network entities to behave in an adaptive and intelligent manner.

In this paper, a novel network architecture called Energy Efficient and Enhanced-type Data-centric Network (E 3 -DCN) is proposed for ICN. E 3 -DCN not only realizes ICN but also has the ability of data generation by organizing and combining relevant resource such as original data and kinds of processing services. In addition, in order to improve energy efficiency of data transmission, E 3 -DCN chooses optimal transmission path to transmit data based on packet switching and optical switching. Moreover, based on current traffic situation, E 3 -DCN reconfigures network topology such as unused nodes and links to operate in sleep mode for energy saving dynamically. And meanwhile, data caching strategies are applied into E 3 -DCN for data distribution based on the distribution of users. Data caching shortens transmission distance, so data transmission energy, latency and network load is decreased. Based on these approaches, E 3 -DCN achieves an energy efficient network.",,2015,42,filtered,citation

These challenges stem from the increasing incorporation of distributed renewable energy sources on to the grid, the rising deployment of electric vehicles, and active consumer participation into power grid operations, all of which communicate with the utility control center with varying degrees of priority and security. To address these challenging requirements, we propose SeDAX, a SEcure Data-centric Application eXtensible platform for Smart Grid applications. SeDAX implements scalable, resilient and secure data delivery and data sharing in a wide area network. The platform can scalably handle high volumes of data generated by both applications and sensors. The SeDAX architecture has as its basis a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) network. The properties of the DT graph are leveraged to scalably support secure data-centric (or information-centric) group communication. The primary goals of this platform are to support communication resilience and data availability. The key functional blocks of the SeDAX platform are: (1) a geographic hash forwarding algorithm that operates over the DT graph (DT-GHF), and (2) a DT-based data replication scheme. The forwarding and replication schemes are scalable and cost effective in terms of communication overhead and memory. We describe the design details of the SeDAX platform and present empirical results on the performance of SeDAX as compared with other geometric-based alternatives such as Geographic Hash Table (GHT) forwarding and Content Addressable Networking (CAN).

M2M サービスの要件と提案アーキテクチャ 2.1. M2M サービスの要件 新世代ネットワークの要件としては、過去に NICT 研究開発戦略本部や研究プロジェクト(AKARI)によ って、特定のサービスを想定しない一般的な要件(大 容量、スケーラブル、オープン性など)が提言されて いる。 [1] 本研究ではこれらの要件を更に具体化するために、 サービスの一例として今後急速な普及が予想される M2M サービスを想定し、その要件を抽出した。  要件 1:端末(M2M 機器)の大量化、低価格化、 低機能化 500 億個以上の端末がネットワークに接続され、そ の大半がセンサなど低機能且つ低価格な端末とな るため、簡易なネットワーク接続方式や通信方式が 必要となる。  要件 2:端末やネットワークの移動、更新の容易化 端末の移動・移設(仮想サーバのマイグレーション を含む)や交換は最小限の設定だけで容易に実現で きることが必要となる。端末が接続されるネットワ ークもイーサネットと同等のネットワーク構成の 更新容易性が必要となる。  要件 3:データのダイナミックな変化への対応 M2M 機器が発信するデータはダイナミックに変化 し、データの追加・移動・更新・削除が頻繁且つ不 規則に発生する。データが利用されるタイミングの 予測は困難であり、センサの状態データのように一 時的に蓄積された後削除されるデータも多い。ネッ トワークはこのようなデータに逐次追随しつつア クセス可能とすることが必要となる。  要件 4:多対多通信 大量の端末が発信するデータを多数のサービスサ ーバが利用する多対多の通信が増加し、 unicast 以 外の通信形態(broadcast、multicast、publish/subscribe、 クエリ /key-value-store)が通信の大半を占めるよう になるため、ネットワークはこれらの通信形態をサ ポートする必要がある。 2.2. 提案アーキテクチャ 本研究では、前述の新世代ネットワークの要件に適 した新たなネットワークアーキテクチャとして、 Data-centric Network(DCN)を提案する。従来のネッ トワークは端末間のデータ通信を主目的としていた。 一方現在では、所望のデータを取得することがネット ワークの主目的となっている。DCN はこのようなネッ トワークの利用形態の変化を踏まえ、膨大な量のデー タから容易にデータを取得することができるネットワ ークアーキテクチャの実現を目指す。 図 1 に本研究で想定するネットワークアーキテク チャの変遷を示す。従来の PSTN が音声通話などの人 対人の通信が中心で、現在のインターネットが WEB などの人対モノの 1 対 1 通信が中心であるのに対し、 DCN は将来のセンサや機器同士が通信するモノ対モ ノの多対多通信に適したアーキテクチャを目指す。 DCN では端末は通信相手の端末を意識せずに、取得し たいデータの ID を指定するだけで通信を行う。 図 1 ネットワークアーキテクチャの遷移 2.1 章で挙げた要件に対し、現状の IP ネットワーク と将来求められる DCN の比較を表 1 に示す。 表 1 IP ネットワークと DCN の比較",,2012,49,filtered,citation

Several future Internet architectures, putting the content (or information) in the fore-front, have lately been proposed in order to solve the limitations of the current architecture (i.e. insufficient bandwidth to servers, lack of security, mobility, virtualization, user/data centricity, etc.). However, one of the greatest challenges of a novel content-oriented Internet architecture lies in the complexity of looking up long, variable length names compared to the current 32 bit long IPv4 (or even 128 bit IPv6) addresses of today's networks. The success of widely adopting any content-oriented architecture highly depends on the success of designing algorithms that allow these complex names to be looked up at high-speed. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) are widely used in high-speed routers to find matching routes for packets in a routing table. They enable the longest prefix matching (LPM) operation on fixed length addresses to complete in a single clock cycle, however, they are not efficient to store and lookup name prefixes with variable lengths such as the ones proposed in name-based routing [2]–[9]. In this paper, we propose an efficient name-based longest prefix matching algorithm for information-centric networks using TCAMs. In our algorithm, we split incoming prefixes in fixed blocks and subsequently hash these blocks for fixed length storage. Our approach is flexible to support both hierarchical name based routing lookup and flat name based routing lookup. In addition, our approach can be easily modified to support multiple matchings1 instead of the longest prefix matching. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach is able to provide efficient name-based routing lookup even for the fastest backbone routers (i.e. 100+ Gbps).",2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2012,50,filtered,citation

DCN introduces concept of route attraction and aggregation in which the related routes are attracted to an aggregation point and aggregated to reduce routing table size, and route optimization in which optimized routes are established routes to reduce access transaction load to the aggregation points.

To uniformly capture dataflow, controlflow, and workflow, we use a subclass of Petri nets as an intuitive high-level model, which is translated into a weaker model — namely, a new variant of Petri nets that does not make any atomicity assumptions but instead uses a partial order to ensure eventual consistency.

IPAs capabilities are expanding rapidly due to the recent advances on areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial cognition, and ubiquitous computing, which equip the agents with competences to understand what users say, collect information from everyday ubiquitous devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, tablets, laptops, cars, household appliances, etc.), learn user preferences, deliver data-driven search results, and make decisions based on user's context.

Thus, our contribution in this paper is twofold: 1) we propose an architecture for a platform-agnostic, high-performance, ubiquitous, and distributed middleware that alleviates the burdensome task of dealing with low-level implementation details when building IPAs by adding multiple abstraction layers that hide the underlying complexity; and 2) we present an implementation of the middleware that concretizes the aforementioned architecture and allows the development of high-level capabilities while scaling the system up to hundreds of thousands of IPAs with no extra effort.
