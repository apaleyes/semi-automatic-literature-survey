The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench.

Thereby, the emerging vehicle architecture has to become a data-oriented architecture based on embedded computing platforms and take into account new applications, artificial intelligence elements, advanced analytics, and operating systems. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce the concept of data management to the vehicle by proposing an on-board data management layer, so that the vehicle can play the role of data platform capable of storing, processing, and diffusing data. Our proposed layer supports analytics and data science to deliver additional value from the connected vehicle data and stimulate the development of new services. In addition, our data platform can also form or contribute to shaping the backbone of data-driven transport.

In contrast to process-oriented or transaction-oriented system designs, dataoriented architectures are based on data locality and function shipping. The tight coupling of data and processing thereon is implemented in different systems in a variety of application scenarios such as data analysis, database-as-a-service, and data management on multiprocessor systems. Data-oriented systems, i.e., systems that implement a data-oriented architecture, bundle data and operations together in tasks which are processed locally on the nodes of the distributed system. Allocation strategies, i.e., methods that decide the mapping from tasks to nodes, are core components in data-oriented systems. Good allocation strategies can lead to balanced systems while bad allocation strategies cause skew in the load and therefore suboptimal application performance and infrastructure utilization. Optimal allocation strategies are hard to find given the complexity of the systems, the complicated interactions of tasks, and the huge solution space. To ensure the scalability of dataoriented systems and to keep them manageable with hundreds of thousands of tasks, thousands of nodes, and dynamic workloads, fast and reliable allocation strategies are mandatory. In this thesis, we develop novel allocation strategies for data-oriented systems based on graph partitioning algorithms. Therefore, we show that systems from different application scenarios with different abstraction levels can be generalized to generic infrastructure and workload descriptions. We use weighted graph representations to model infrastructures with bounded and unbounded, i.e., overcommited, resources and possibly non-linear performance characteristics. Based on our generalized infrastructure and workload model, we formalize the allocation problem, which seeks valid and balanced allocations that minimize communication. Our allocation strategies partition the workload graph using solution heuristics that work with single and multiple vertex weights. Novel extensions to these solution heuristics can be used to balance penalized and secondary graph partition weights. These extensions enable the allocation strategies to handle infrastructures with non-linear performance behavior. On top of the basic algorithms, we propose methods to incorporate heterogeneous infrastructures and to react to changing workloads and infrastructures by incrementally updating the partitioning. We evaluate all components of our allocation strategy algorithms and show their applicability and scalability with synthetic workload graphs. In end-to-end– performance experiments in two actual data-oriented systems, a database-as-aservice system and a database management system for multiprocessor systems, we prove that our allocation strategies outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods.",data oriented architecture,13,unknown

In this paper, we study NAS for object detection, a core computer vision task that classifies and localizes object instances in an image. Existing works focus on transferring the searched architecture from classification task (ImageNet) to the detector backbone, while the rest of the architecture of the detector remains unchanged. However, this pipeline is not task-specific or data-oriented network search which cannot guarantee optimal adaptation to any dataset. Therefore, we propose an architecture search framework named Auto-FPN specifically designed for detection beyond simply searching a classification backbone. Specifically, we propose two auto search modules for detection: Auto-fusion to search a better fusion of the multi-level features; Auto-head to search a better structure for classification and bounding-box(bbox) regression. Instead of searching for one repeatable cell structure, we relax the constraint and allow different cells. The search space of both modules covers many popular designs of detectors and allows efficient gradient-based architecture search with resource constraint (2 days for COCO on 8 GPU cards). Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, BDD, VisualGenome and ADE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g. achieving around 5% improvement than FPN in terms of mAP while requiring around 50% fewer parameters on the searched modules.",data oriented architecture,16,unknown

The logic-in-memory architecture is highly promising as future logic-memory integration paradigm for high throughput data-driven applications. From memory technology aspect, as one recently introduced nonvolatile memory device, domain-wall nanowire (or race-track) not only shows potential as future power efficient memory, but also computing capacity by its unique physics of spintronics. This paper explores a novel distributed in-memory computing architecture where most logic functions are executed within the memory, which significantly alleviates the bandwidth congestion issue and improves the energy efficiency. The proposed distributed in-memory computing architecture is purely built by domain-wall nanowire, i.e., both memory and logic are implemented by domain-wall nanowire devices.

Data-oriented behaviors are captured by synchronous dataflow, control-oriented behaviors are captured by timed automata, and asynchronous communications of the interclock domain can be modeled as an interface timed automaton or a synchronous dataflow module. The behaviors of synchronous dataflow are interpreted by some equivalent timed automata to maintain the semantic consistency of the mixed model.

Traditionally, cluster management systems such as Condor employ a process-oriented approach with little or no use of modern database system technology. In contrast, CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution. Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract, higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that CondorJ2’s use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000 nodes).",data oriented architecture,24,unknown

However, the incoming generation of metro networks is based on conventional technology, which prevents them scaling cost-effectively to ultrahigh capacities. We have developed a new architecture and set of protocols for the next generation of metro networks. The architecture, named HORNET (hybrid optoelectronic ring network), is a packet-over-wavelength-division multiplexing ring network that utilizes fast-tunable packet transmitters and wavelength routing to enable it to scale cost-effectively to ultrahigh capacities. A control-channel-based media access control (MAC) protocol enables the network nodes to share the bandwidth of the network while preventing collisions. The MAC protocol is designed to transport variable-sized packets and to provide fairness control to all network end users. The efficiency and the fairness of the MAC protocol is demonstrated with custom-designed simulations. The implementation of the MAC protocol and the survivability of the network have been demonstrated in a laboratory experimental testbed. The article summarizes the accomplishments of the HORNET project, including the design, analysis, and demonstration of a metro architecture and a set of protocols. The HORNET architecture is an excellent candidate for next-generation high-capacity metro networks.",data oriented architecture,25,unknown

In this area, though the high-density multi-GPU architecture enabled unparalleled performance advantage of dense GPUs in a single server, it has increased the difficulty for scheduling diversified and dependent tasks. We therefore propose a data-oriented method for scheduling dependent tasks for this architecture while providing its implementation. In our method, we model a parallel program as a collection of data-dependent tasks for which data dependencies are managed by an expressive matrix. Accordingly, we develop a hierarchical scheduler infrastructure for our model. In this, a top scheduler is built for querying the data-dependency matrix; three downstream schedulers for queuing computation tasks that are exclusively assigned to processor, accelerator or either; and a multitude of bottom schedulers each for providing a processing element with assigned tasks. We experiment our scheduler for examples of Strassen matrix multiplication and Cholesky matrix inversion algorithms on a computer that has 8 Tesla K40 GPUs. The results show that our method is capable of offering the efficient task parallelism while fulfilling the complex task dependencies. When advanced task-oriented schedulers have been widely designed for distributed systems, a lightweight data-driven scheduler could be an alternative and handy approach that can handle the dependent yet diversified tasks of data-intensive applications for the novel high-density multi-accelerator system.",data oriented architecture,27,unknown

These innovations are fueled by a desire to support complex and data-rich web applications while consuming minimal resources. One of the chief advancements has been the emergence of the asynchronous web server architecture, which is built from the ground up for scalability. While this architecture can offer a significant boost in performance over classic forking servers, it does so at the cost of abandoning memory space isolation between client interactions. This shift in design, that delegates the handling of many unrelated requests within the same process, enables powerful and covert data-oriented attacks that rival complete web server takeover — without ever hijacking the control flow of the server application. To demonstrate the severity of this threat, we present a technique for identifying security-critical web server data by tracing memory accesses committed by the program in generating responses to client requests. We further develop a framework for performing live memory analysis of a running server in order to understand how low-level memory structures can be corrupted for malicious intent. A fundamental goal of our work is to assess the realism of such data-oriented attacks in terms of the types of memory errors that can be leveraged to perform them, and to understand the prominence of these errors in real-world web servers. Our case study on a leading asynchronous architecture, namely Nginx, shows how dataoriented attacks allow an adversary to re-configure an Nginx instance on the fly in order to degrade or disable services (e.g., error reporting, security headers like HSTS, access control), steal sensitive information, as well as distribute arbitrary web content to unsuspecting clients — all by manipulating only a few bytes in memory. Our empirical findings on the susceptibility of modern asynchronous web servers to two wellknown CVEs show that the damage could be severe. To address this threat, we also discuss several potential mitigations. Taken as a whole, our work tells a cautionary tale regarding the risks of blindly pushing forward with performance optimizations.",data oriented architecture,28,unknown

At the same time GAF is trying to bring together two (seemingly not intersecting) views on the adaptation: a classical pre-authored type, with conventional domain and overlay user models and data-driven adaptation which includes a set of data mining, machine learning and information retrieval tools. To bring these research fields together we conducted a number GAF compliance studies including RS, AHS, and other applications combining adaptation, recommendation and search.

This also helps to understand the compliance features mentioned earlier. Besides that GAF deals with important and novel aspects of adaptation enabling and leveraging technologies such as provenance and versioning. The existence of such a reference basis should stimulate AHS research and enable researchers to demonstrate ideas for new adaptation methods much more quickly than if they had to start from scratch.

A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks.

One has concerned the construction of increasingly more powerful infrastructure for the support of open hypermedia navigation systems, while the other has concerned the application of hypermedia technologies and concepts to increasingly diverse domains. This dissertation addresses how these trends can be merged, resulting in a framework for design of powerful, general infrastructure. 
An examination of the domains to which hypermedia concepts have been applied yields to the conclusion that all rely on general structure and general structural computation. A philosophy of computation is presented called structural computing that stresses the primacy of these concepts. Without such a philosophy, structure is seen as an ad hoc functionality to be added over data-oriented programs. Different structure-oriented domains are seen as special cases of navigational hypertext, with a corresponding confusion of basic terminologies. 
An analysis of the historical development of hypermedia systems leads to the conclusion that current open hypermedia systems can be modified in a straightforward way to support structural computing by opening the link server layer in traditional hypermedia architectures. The resultant generalized link server is called a structure processor (Sproc). Different Sprocs encapsulate tailoring and extension of the structure and structural computation models provided by the structure store of the system. 
A conceptual architecture for an environment to support structural computing (named HOSS) is presented. This architecture is divided into two parts. The operating system layer describes the basic services available to all HOSS programs. The computing environment layer consists of an open set of programs that run address specific structural computing domains. A prototypic implementation of the operating system layer and several example computing environment layer programs is described, which provides a proof of concept of the structural computing environment architecture presented. The sample programs substantiate the claims that such an environment can support the design and implementation of a wide variety of structural computing programs.

The BioFederator is a web services-based data federation architecture for bioinformatics applications. Based on collaborations with bioinformatics researchers, several domainspecific data federation challenges and needs are identified. The BioFederator addresses such challenges and provides an architecture that incorporates a series of utility services. These address issues like automatic workflow composition, domain semantics, and the distributed nature of the data. It also incorporates a series of data-oriented services that facilitate the actual integration of data. The BioFederator is deployed on a grid environment over the web.

A big-data-driven application requires huge bandwidth and yet able to ensure low-power density. For example, web-searching application involves crawling, comparing, ranking, and paging of billions of web-pages with extensive memory access. The existing memory technologies have critical challenges of scaling at nano-scale due to process variation, leakage current and I/O access limitations. Recently, the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as resistive-RAM (ReRAM), spintransfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), domain-wall nanowire racetrack memory etc., have all shown significantly reduced standby power and increased integration density, not forgetting the close-to DRAM/SRAM access speed. Therefore, they are considered as promising candidates of universal memory for future big-data applications. The primary challenge to validate a hybrid design with both CMOS and nonvolatile devices is the lack of design platform that can validate the large-scale NVM circuit and system design accurately and efficiently. In addition, due to the use of non-electrical states of emerging NVM devices, new cells structures and their agreeing circuits for both read and write operations are needed to harness non-volatile memory with unique operations. For example, the transistor-free crossbar array that associates with NVM is different from conventional access transistor based memory structure. What is more, leveraging the NVM for computing, one also needs to examine the potential logic-inmemory computing architecture with significantly improved bandwidth and reduced power. In order to tackle above challenges ranging from device to system levels, this PhD thesis has explored the development of NVM design platform to support designs of non-volatile memories, readout and logic circuit designs, as well as the in-memory computing architecture. For the NVM design platform, the target is to perform accurate yet efficient circuit level simulation. The previous approaches either ignore dynamic effect without considering non-volatile states for dynamic behavior, or need equivalent circuits with high complexity to curve-fit non-linearity of those devices. We proposed a SPICE simulaiii tor named NVM-SPICE. This tool takes advantages of its new modified nodal analysis (MNA) framework, which can effectively support the non-electrical state variables of emerging non-volatile devices, such as ReRAM and spintronics devices. Due to the physics based modeling approach, NVM-SPICE is able to perform hybrid NVM/CMOS circuits efficiently and accurately. Compared to the equivalent circuit model based approach, the NVM-SPICE simulator exhibits more than 117x faster simulation speed for spintronics category devices and 40x faster speed for RRAM category devices. For NVM in-memory architecture, both memory elements and logic elements are implemented by emerging spintronics devices, which leads to a system purely composed of non-volatile devices. The detailed non-volatile memory and logic circuits are explored within the NVM-SPICE platform. In addition, logic is built inside the memory so that the I/O workload can be alleviated. Applications such as data retention, encryption, machine learning that play critical roles for big-data computing are explored within the non-volatile in-memory architecture. The evaluation results show that the purely non-volatile memory based platforms with in-memory architecture greatly contribute to power efficiency and throughput improvement for big-data oriented applications, and thus are potential candidates to be next generation information and communication technology.",data oriented architecture,63,unknown

In an exemplar-based approach, language acquisition is modeled as the incremental, data-oriented storage of experiential patterns, and language performance as the extrapolation of information from those stored patterns on the basis of a language-independent information-theoretic similarity metric. We show that this simple architecture works for many aspects of phonological, morphological, and morphosyntactic acquisition and processing. Furthermore, we sketch how the approach may also work for syntactic processing. A central insight of the approach, based on the results of computational modeling experiments, is that abstraction of representations is not only unnecessary to achieve generalization (i.e. to make the system productive, and to make it gòbeyond' the learned patterns), but even harmful, and that useful language-independent metrics can be found for deening similarity in the context of language processing. In the generative tradition, generality is achieved by means of abstraction, and the representations of choice to describe these abstractions are rules. This implies that redundancy and the storage of individual instances are to be avoided, except for exceptions to the generalizations expressed in rules. In Langacker, 1991 (Chapter 10), this methodology is critically examined, and cognitive grammar is described as an alternative usage-based model of language structure. In the latter, bottom-up, approach, patterns (rules, generalizations) and (redundant) instantiations of those rules are assumed to co-exist in the grammar, describing phenomena at all levels of generality, from exceptionless regularities to idiosyncratic exceptions. Rules are presumed to be necessary for the computation of novel instantiations. In the remainder of this paper we will introduce an exemplar-based approach to language acquisition and processing. The approach is in large part compatible with Lan-gacker's usage-based model, but is more radical in its ""maximalism"": language knowledge is supposed to consist only of ""instantiations"" (exemplars); there is no role for explicit abstractions corresponding to (sub)regularities. We will argue on the basis of computational modeling experiments that the adoption of abstractions (rules, patterns), taken as necessary for explaining generalization and productivity in both the generative and the cognitive grammar approach, is misguided. Furthermore, the exemplar-based approach contributes to making cognitive grammar ideas more concrete by providing computational operationalisations of both acquisition and processing in such a framework.",data oriented architecture,64,unknown

Nonetheless, due to NDN's current preliminary research, less research has combined these two technologies together. This paper presents some new thoughts to study on the benefits brought by integrating network coding to NDN, which can effectively improve network utilization, strengthen caching privacy, and also promote development of the NDN architecture itself.",data oriented architecture,65,unknown

CCN (Content Centric Networking) [1] is one of the most important proposals for future Internet architecture, which aims to build a content/data oriented network to solve these limitations. On the other hand, HTTP is the most important protocol to deploy new services and applications on current TCP/IP-based Internet. In this paper, we attempt to run HTTP protocol on CCN and combine the two by stitching them semantically on their content-oriented features, such as content caching. We expect that this combination can be leveraged to build CCN testbed with real HTTP traffic which is vital to validation and redesigning of specific mechanisms of CCN and to finding a transition way of CCN in which great incentive is provided for service providers in the economic ecosystem of content distribution. We designed and implemented a HTTP-CCN gateway to transform HTTP request and HTTP response into CCN Interest and Data respectively. We illustrate how to semantically map HTTP caching to CCN caching, which is one of the most attractive properties of CCN. We also discuss how to achieve transparent caching with CCN and find out that it is nontrivial to achieve complete transparency of caching with CCN given no cooperation with CDNs and content providers.",data oriented architecture,66,unknown

In this paper, we studied various DRM model, technology and application, and first proposed DRM Security Infrastructure (DSI), in which we defined encryption, hash, signature algorithm, watermarking algorithms, authentication, usage control, trusted counter, conditional trace, secure payment, and based on the DSI we then proposed a whole classification approach and architecture of all kinds of DRMs, in which we proposed 6 typical classes of copyrights and content protection DRMs architecture: (1) Software-oriented DRM,(2) eBook-oriented DRM, (3) Video-oriented DRM, (4)Image-Oriented DRM (5) Unstructured data oriented DRM, (6) Text-oriented DRM. Based on the above DSI, we then proposed a dynamic DRM model selection method for various DRM application, which can be adapted dynamically for different technology of different applications, which can provide a whole solution for variant DRM development in a rapid and customized mode. The proposed DRM method, technology and application in this paper provided a common, flexible and extendable solution for variant DRM scenes, and can support rapid and customized development.

However, the bit rate is limited to around 2 Mbps with limited mobility. Today, more applications demand high data rate and reasonable mobility. Therefore, by integrating 3G cellular system and wireless local area network (WLAN), there is a potential to push the data rate higher. This integration means 3G cellular users can enjoy high data rate at a location that is within WLAN coverage area. Similarly, WLAN users also can have data services as long as they are under the coverage of the 3G cellular system. The 3G cellular system has a much larger coverage than the WLAN. In this paper, we present the first step toward an integration of the two systems. This paper presents a fiber-wireless architecture that simultaneously supports the wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system and the IEEE 802.11b WLAN. Our approach uses sub-carrier multiplexed (SCM) architecture to combine and transmit 2.4 GHz WLAN and 1.9 GHz WCDMA signals through an optical fiber from a central base station (CBS) to a radio access point (RAP, single antenna unit). After the fiber, the signals continue to propagate through the air interface to respective mobile stations. The WLAN access point is also located at the CBS. For the SCM architecture, we investigate three areas: i) the signal to noise ratio of the uplink and the downlink, ii) the cell coverage area for the WCDMA and WLAN systems, and iii) the throughput of the IEEE 802.11b WLAN. Our results show that with up to 2.5 km cell radius, better than 18 dB SNR is possible with 5 km fiber link for WLAN system. Simultaneously, the WCDMA system has at least 18 dB SNR for a cell coverage radius of 8 km. These numbers depend on the relative RF power of each system in the fiber.",data oriented architecture,68,unknown

In order effectively to channel limited resources (skills, capital, technology) to the most strategically critical communication needs of the organization, the development of business driven planning methodologies which result in a well-defined architecture (blueprint) of organizational communication processes are needed. Unfortunately, while architectural issues are of utmost importance today, researchers have focused almost exclusively on data oriented models. This study attempts to expand this view and provide a holistic representation of information architecture. With the perspective provided by this definitional framework, two methods for development of communications architecture are discussed and evaluated: (1) a flow based approach; and (2) network analysis. Network analysis in particular shows great promise in constructing robust representations of organizational communication processes.",data oriented architecture,69,unknown

For some areas, such as high-integrity and safety-critical domains, this precision is imperative rather than optional. To address this issue, both academia and industry have been applying formal methods and formal verification techniques, where model checking and theorem proving are the most successful. Model checking is a verification technique that exhaustively searches the state space of a system represented by some formal notation. It became a successful technique applied by both academia and industry, due to its high level of automation and the ability to provide counter-examples as a debugging device in the case of failure. The difficulty of applying this technique is the state explosion problem that often happens in software verification, hence making such technique unsuitable for representation by computer. In order to finitely represent infinite state systems to be analysed by computer, one needs to resort to the more powerful technique of theorem proving. It allows precise description with less compromise on the state representation, as it uses symbols and quantifiers rather than actual values. The problem is that the higher the expressiveness of a notation, the lower the level of automation that it supports and greater the demand for user expertise and interactivity. The maturity of these techniques, as well as the wide availability of tools, pushed the demand for more expressive techniques with powerful automation tool support. Thus, combination of formalisms and their tools have become a topic of great interest in current research in formal methods. The combination of formalisms usually involve blending mature techniques that cover different aspects of software development in a common semantical framework. For instance, combining data oriented languages, such as Z and B, with behaviour oriented languages, such as CCS and CSP has been the focus of considerable research. The next step in this direction is to provide tool support for these combined languages. The combination of model checking and theorem proving have become the state-of-the-art in terms of tool development for formal verification techniques, as it combines expressiveness with high levels of automation. In this thesis, our main goal is to provide model checking support with integrated theorem proving for Circus, a concurrent language for refinement that combines Z, CSP, and the refinement calculus. Its semantic model is based on Hoare and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP), which provides an integrated theoretical framework for development and extension of different programming paradigms. From the partnership of our research group with QinetiQ Malvern, it is clear that there is demand for integrated formalisms and respective tool support. Our aim is to provide tool support for Circus, in order to allow its use in real applications, where we are able to formally specify different aspects of systems including, but not limited to, data and behaviour. As Circus is based in UTP, it is possible to integrate other aspects, such as mobility, and real-time, and research in these fronts is well advanced. To fulfill our goal, we provided an operational semantics for model checking Circus, which enables the representation of Circus programs as automata, as well as a search algorithm enabling us to establish refinement between two programs. Throughout the development process, we have decided to take our own medicine and use formal specification and verification, in order to increase the levels of integrity of our tools and techniques. The semantics and the underlying automata theory has been formally defined and mechanised in the Z/Eves theorem prover. Next, we proposed a model checking architecture, which integrates theorem proving facilities, and is implemented as a model checker prototype in Java. This architecture has been formally defined in Circus itself, and we augmented the Java code with JML annotations and assertions representing our findings from the formal specification. Finally, from the abstract Circus specification of the model checker architecture, we calculated a sequential refinement search algorithm using Circus refinement laws, where generated proof obligations have been discharged using Z/Eves again. This effort gave rise to a prototype model checking tool for Circus, which integrates refinement model checking with theorem proving in an extensible framework compliant with the Z Standard.",data oriented architecture,71,unknown

We provided selective encryption and adaptive security in the Tracking Authority (TA), using the machine learning classifier k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN). We conducted experimental study to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed k-NN classifier in selective encryption and adaptive security.

Modern, future-proof architecture that provides better service quality, requires easier and cheaper maintenance, and consequently brings greater financial benefits is the main driving force for that action. In this moment, Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployment is a goal most mobile network operators are aspiring to. This paper describes presently ongoing changes in the mobile communication networks from the perspective of voice services they provide. Namely, LTE network is, so far, mainly recognized as a “data oriented” network. Having in mind enormous mobile data traffic increase, deployment of that kind of network is fully understandable and justified. However, voice services are still important part of telecommunications’ market offer. So, the above mentioned changes are leading not only toward satisfaction of growing needs regarding mobile data traffic, but also toward utilization of LTE network attributes for the purposes of voice communication. Complete transformation of mobile networks architecture and evolution of traditional voice communication will occur in the process. So far, that evolution has resulted with development of a mechanism know as voice over LTE. However, the mentioned changes are coming gradually and will take a certain time to be fully accomplished. In the meantime, some transition solutions are defined and deployed, in order to enable uninterrupted provisioning of voice services. Their description is included in the paper as well.

Depending on the architectural emphasis, there are different styles, for example, Three-tier architecture for a distributed system (interface, middleware, back-end database), Blackboard, Layered architectures, Model-View-Controller, Time-triggered and so forth. Architectural Design supports stakeholder communication, system analysis and large-scale reuse. It is possible to distinguish diverse design strategies: function oriented (sees the design of the functions as primary), data oriented (sees the data as the primary structured element and drives design from there), object oriented (sees objects as the primary element of design). There is no clear distinction between Sub-systems and modules. Intuitively, sub-systems are independent and composed of modules, have defined interfaces for communication with other sub-systems. Modules are system components and provide/make use of service(s) to/provided by other modules. The system architecture affects the quality attributes (e.g., performance, security, availability, modifiability, portability, reusability, testability, maintainability, etc.) of a system. It supports quality analysis (e.g., reviewing techniques, static analysis, simulation, performance analysis, prototyping, etc.). It allows to define (predictive) measures (i.e., metrics) on the design, but they are usually very dependent on the process in use. The software architecture is the fundamental framework for structuring the system. Different architectural models (e.g., system organizational models, modular decomposition models and control models) may be developed. Design decisions enhance system attributes like, for instance, performance (e.g., localize operations to minimize sub-system communication), security (e.g., use a layered architecture with critical assets in inner layers), safety (e.g., isolate safety-critical components), availability (e.g., include redundant components in the architecture) and maintainability (e.g., use fine-grain self-contained components).
