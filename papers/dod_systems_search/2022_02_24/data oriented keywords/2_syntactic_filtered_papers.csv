The conceptual model of presented method as data-oriented architecture is designed to implement it with hardware. This method is able to determine the exact place of one and two bits in error and correct them.

Since unicast routing cannot exploit the natural broadcast property of wireless networks and unicast paths may be broken down frequently due to node mobility, broadcast transmission is applied for content delivery in information-centric multihop wireless networks. It will face two key challenges: which nodes that receive the broadcasted packet should forward it, and how to avoid multiple nodes simultaneously transmitting it. In this letter, we solve these two issues by taking node mobility and available link capacity into account. A mobility-based forward node selection algorithm is proposed, which tends to select the less mobility nodes as the forward ones. An available link capacity-based forwarding scheme is proposed, which tends to select forward nodes with larger available link capacities to forward packets.

The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in bearing fault detection under all operational conditions.

They can be used to make right decisions, improve road safety, reduce CO2 emissions, or optimize processes. However, analyzing these data is not so much a question of which technologies to use, but rather about where these data are analyzed. Thereby, the emerging vehicle architecture has to become a data-oriented architecture based on embedded computing platforms and take into account new applications, artificial intelligence elements, advanced analytics, and operating systems. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce the concept of data management to the vehicle by proposing an on-board data management layer, so that the vehicle can play the role of data platform capable of storing, processing, and diffusing data. Our proposed layer supports analytics and data science to deliver additional value from the connected vehicle data and stimulate the development of new services. In addition, our data platform can also form or contribute to shaping the backbone of data-driven transport.

Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result.

The proposed system is built around two types of nodes: forwarding nodes and branching nodes. The forwarding nodes are optimized for throughput with no per-subscription state and no need to change passing packets, while branching nodes contain a large memory for caching and can make complex routing decisions. The amount of storage space and bandwidth can be independently scaled to suit the needs of each network. In the background, topology nodes perform load-balancing and configure routes in each domain using a two-dimensional addressing mechanism.

In contrast to process-oriented or transaction-oriented system designs, dataoriented architectures are based on data locality and function shipping. The tight coupling of data and processing thereon is implemented in different systems in a variety of application scenarios such as data analysis, database-as-a-service, and data management on multiprocessor systems. Data-oriented systems, i.e., systems that implement a data-oriented architecture, bundle data and operations together in tasks which are processed locally on the nodes of the distributed system. Allocation strategies, i.e., methods that decide the mapping from tasks to nodes, are core components in data-oriented systems. Good allocation strategies can lead to balanced systems while bad allocation strategies cause skew in the load and therefore suboptimal application performance and infrastructure utilization. Optimal allocation strategies are hard to find given the complexity of the systems, the complicated interactions of tasks, and the huge solution space. To ensure the scalability of dataoriented systems and to keep them manageable with hundreds of thousands of tasks, thousands of nodes, and dynamic workloads, fast and reliable allocation strategies are mandatory. In this thesis, we develop novel allocation strategies for data-oriented systems based on graph partitioning algorithms. Therefore, we show that systems from different application scenarios with different abstraction levels can be generalized to generic infrastructure and workload descriptions. We use weighted graph representations to model infrastructures with bounded and unbounded, i.e., overcommited, resources and possibly non-linear performance characteristics. Based on our generalized infrastructure and workload model, we formalize the allocation problem, which seeks valid and balanced allocations that minimize communication. Our allocation strategies partition the workload graph using solution heuristics that work with single and multiple vertex weights. Novel extensions to these solution heuristics can be used to balance penalized and secondary graph partition weights. These extensions enable the allocation strategies to handle infrastructures with non-linear performance behavior. On top of the basic algorithms, we propose methods to incorporate heterogeneous infrastructures and to react to changing workloads and infrastructures by incrementally updating the partitioning. We evaluate all components of our allocation strategy algorithms and show their applicability and scalability with synthetic workload graphs. In end-to-end– performance experiments in two actual data-oriented systems, a database-as-aservice system and a database management system for multiprocessor systems, we prove that our allocation strategies outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods.",data oriented architecture,20

 This demonstration highlights the chaotic access patterns of conventional OLTP designs which are the source of scalability problems. Then, it presents a working prototype of a transaction processing engine that follows a non-conventional architecture, called data-oriented or DORA.

In this paper, we study NAS for object detection, a core computer vision task that classifies and localizes object instances in an image. Existing works focus on transferring the searched architecture from classification task (ImageNet) to the detector backbone, while the rest of the architecture of the detector remains unchanged. However, this pipeline is not task-specific or data-oriented network search which cannot guarantee optimal adaptation to any dataset. Therefore, we propose an architecture search framework named Auto-FPN specifically designed for detection beyond simply searching a classification backbone. Specifically, we propose two auto search modules for detection: Auto-fusion to search a better fusion of the multi-level features; Auto-head to search a better structure for classification and bounding-box(bbox) regression. Instead of searching for one repeatable cell structure, we relax the constraint and allow different cells. The search space of both modules covers many popular designs of detectors and allows efficient gradient-based architecture search with resource constraint (2 days for COCO on 8 GPU cards). Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, BDD, VisualGenome and ADE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, e.g. achieving around 5% improvement than FPN in terms of mAP while requiring around 50% fewer parameters on the searched modules.",data oriented architecture,25

The logic-in-memory architecture is highly promising as future logic-memory integration paradigm for high throughput data-driven applications. From memory technology aspect, as one recently introduced nonvolatile memory device, domain-wall nanowire (or race-track) not only shows potential as future power efficient memory, but also computing capacity by its unique physics of spintronics. This paper explores a novel distributed in-memory computing architecture where most logic functions are executed within the memory, which significantly alleviates the bandwidth congestion issue and improves the energy efficiency. The proposed distributed in-memory computing architecture is purely built by domain-wall nanowire, i.e., both memory and logic are implemented by domain-wall nanowire devices. As a case study, neural network-based image resolution enhancement algorithm, called DW-NN, is examined within the proposed architecture. We show that all operations involved in machine learning on neural network can be mapped to a logic-in-memory architecture by nonvolatile domain-wall nanowire. Domain-wall nanowire-based logic is customized for in machine learning within image data storage. As such, both neural network training and processing can be performed locally within the memory. The experimental results show that the domain-wall memory can reduce 92% leakage power and 16% dynamic power compared to main memory implemented by DRAM; and domain-wall logic can reduce 31% both dynamic and 65% leakage power under the similar performance compared to CMOS transistor-based logic. And system throughput in DW-NN is improved by 11.6x and the energy efficiency is improved by 56x when compared to conventional image processing system.",data oriented architecture,26

The key challenge in designing such systems is that two situations have to be captured and evaluated in a single framework. The first is the heterogeneous control-oriented and data-oriented behaviors within one clock domain, and the second is the asynchronous communications between two clock domains. In this paper, we propose to use timed automata and synchronous dataflow to model the dynamic behaviors of the multiclock train-control system, and a multiprocessor architecture for the implementation from our model to the real system. Data-oriented behaviors are captured by synchronous dataflow, control-oriented behaviors are captured by timed automata, and asynchronous communications of the interclock domain can be modeled as an interface timed automaton or a synchronous dataflow module. The behaviors of synchronous dataflow are interpreted by some equivalent timed automata to maintain the semantic consistency of the mixed model. Then, various functional properties that are important to guarantee the correctness of the system can be simulated and verified within the framework.

In-memory database systems running on NUMA platforms face several issues such as the increased latency and the decreased bandwidth when accessing remote main memory. To cope with these NUMA-related issues, NUMA-awareness has to be considered as a major design principle for the fundamental architecture of a database system. In this paper we present ERIS, a NUMA-aware inmemory storage engine that is based on a data-oriented architecture. In contrast to existing approaches that focus on transactional workloads on a disk-based DBMS, ERIS aims at tera-scale analytical workloads that are executed entirely in main memory. ERIS uses an adaptive partitioning approach that exploits the topology of the underlying NUMA platform and significantly reduces NUMA-related issues. We evaluate ERIS on widespread standard server systems as well as on a system consisting of 64 multiprocessors and 512 cores. On these platforms, we achieve a more than linear speedup for index lookups and scalable parallel scan operations that are only limited by the available local bandwidth of the multiprocessor. Moreover, we measured a performance gain of up to 200% (index lookups) respectively 660% (column scans) in the memory-bound case compared to a NUMA-agnostic storage subsystem.",data oriented architecture,37

While disk-based in-storage processing has not been widely adopted, due to the characteristics of hard disks, modern SSDs provide high performance on concurrent random writes, and have powerful processors, memory, and multiple I/O channels to flash memory, enabling in-storage processing with almost no hardware changes. In addition, offloading I/O tasks allows a host system to fully utilize devices' internal parallelism without knowing the details of their hardware configurations. To leverage the enhanced data processing capabilities of modern SSDs, we introduce the Smart SSD model, which pairs in-device processing with a powerful host system capable of handling data-oriented tasks without modifying operating system code. By isolating the data traffic within the device, this model promises low energy consumption, high parallelism, low host memory footprint and better performance. To demonstrate these capabilities, we constructed a prototype implementing this model on a real SATA-based SSD. Our system uses an object-based protocol for low-level communication with the host, and extends the Hadoop MapReduce framework to support a Smart SSD. Our experiments show that total energy consumption is reduced by 50% due to the low-power processing inside a Smart SSD.

The coordination process is achieved through inter-system dependencies controlled by a central, global coordinator. Coordination, like integration, may be either data- or application-oriented. In the case of data-oriented coordination, multidatabase technologies may be exploited to maintain global data consistency. For application-oriented coordination, the global coordinator uses operational dependencies as a basis for the invocation of methods in remote systems. We examine each of these orientations in detail and then provide a comparison of approaches. Specifically, we describe two prototype systems developed in the context of the CIM/Z project.",data oriented architecture,49

However, it can no longer be tied to a content location or to a particular host, since multiple copies of a same data can reside in various network locations. Therefore, a data-oriented access control model must be adopted.

In this area, though the high-density multi-GPU architecture enabled unparalleled performance advantage of dense GPUs in a single server, it has increased the difficulty for scheduling diversified and dependent tasks. We therefore propose a data-oriented method for scheduling dependent tasks for this architecture while providing its implementation. In our method, we model a parallel program as a collection of data-dependent tasks for which data dependencies are managed by an expressive matrix. Accordingly, we develop a hierarchical scheduler infrastructure for our model. In this, a top scheduler is built for querying the data-dependency matrix; three downstream schedulers for queuing computation tasks that are exclusively assigned to processor, accelerator or either; and a multitude of bottom schedulers each for providing a processing element with assigned tasks. We experiment our scheduler for examples of Strassen matrix multiplication and Cholesky matrix inversion algorithms on a computer that has 8 Tesla K40 GPUs. The results show that our method is capable of offering the efficient task parallelism while fulfilling the complex task dependencies. When advanced task-oriented schedulers have been widely designed for distributed systems, a lightweight data-driven scheduler could be an alternative and handy approach that can handle the dependent yet diversified tasks of data-intensive applications for the novel high-density multi-accelerator system.",data oriented architecture,52

These innovations are fueled by a desire to support complex and data-rich web applications while consuming minimal resources. One of the chief advancements has been the emergence of the asynchronous web server architecture, which is built from the ground up for scalability. While this architecture can offer a significant boost in performance over classic forking servers, it does so at the cost of abandoning memory space isolation between client interactions. This shift in design, that delegates the handling of many unrelated requests within the same process, enables powerful and covert data-oriented attacks that rival complete web server takeover — without ever hijacking the control flow of the server application. To demonstrate the severity of this threat, we present a technique for identifying security-critical web server data by tracing memory accesses committed by the program in generating responses to client requests. We further develop a framework for performing live memory analysis of a running server in order to understand how low-level memory structures can be corrupted for malicious intent. A fundamental goal of our work is to assess the realism of such data-oriented attacks in terms of the types of memory errors that can be leveraged to perform them, and to understand the prominence of these errors in real-world web servers. Our case study on a leading asynchronous architecture, namely Nginx, shows how dataoriented attacks allow an adversary to re-configure an Nginx instance on the fly in order to degrade or disable services (e.g., error reporting, security headers like HSTS, access control), steal sensitive information, as well as distribute arbitrary web content to unsuspecting clients — all by manipulating only a few bytes in memory. Our empirical findings on the susceptibility of modern asynchronous web servers to two wellknown CVEs show that the damage could be severe. To address this threat, we also discuss several potential mitigations. Taken as a whole, our work tells a cautionary tale regarding the risks of blindly pushing forward with performance optimizations.",data oriented architecture,54

In particular, WASA aims at flexible and platform-independent workflow support, with respect to both specification and execution of workflows. It turns out that the modeling and execution of workflows in traditional and in scientific applications exhibit significant differences. In particular, the need for dynamic modifications of workflow models while workflows are running is an important feature in scientific applications. Observations like these have resulted in a generic WASA architecture, which can be tailored towards various specific application domains. The conceptual design and functionality of a WASA prototype is outlined, in particular that of its core workflow engine, and it is shown how the requirements of flexibility in modeling and executing workflows, imposed by scientific applications, are met by this prototype.",data oriented architecture,55

At the same time GAF is trying to bring together two (seemingly not intersecting) views on the adaptation: a classical pre-authored type, with conventional domain and overlay user models and data-driven adaptation which includes a set of data mining, machine learning and information retrieval tools. To bring these research fields together we conducted a number GAF compliance studies including RS, AHS, and other applications combining adaptation, recommendation and search. We also performed a number of real systems’ case-studies to prove the point and perform a detailed analysis and evaluation of the framework. Secondly it introduces a number of new ideas in the field of AH, such as the Generic Adaptation Process (GAP) which aligns with a layered (data-oriented) architecture and serves as a reference adaptation process. This also helps to understand the compliance features mentioned earlier. Besides that GAF deals with important and novel aspects of adaptation enabling and leveraging technologies such as provenance and versioning. The existence of such a reference basis should stimulate AHS research and enable researchers to demonstrate ideas for new adaptation methods much more quickly than if they had to start from scratch.

These primitives form the foundation for code-reuse and data-oriented attacks. While various defenses against the former class of attacks have proven effective, mitigation of the latter remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify various shortcomings of the x86 architecture regarding memory isolation, and leverage virtualization to build an effective defense against data-oriented attacks. Our approach, called xMP, provides (in-guest) selective memory protection primitives that allow VMs to isolate sensitive data in user or kernel space in disjoint xMP domains. We interface the Xen altp2m subsystem with the Linux memory management system, lending VMs the flexibility to define custom policies. Contrary to conventional approaches, xMP takes advantage of virtualization extensions, but after initialization, it does not require any hypervisor intervention. To ensure the integrity of in-kernel management information and pointers to sensitive data within isolated domains, xMP protects pointers with HMACs bound to an immutable context, so that integrity validation succeeds only in the right context. We have applied xMP to protect the page tables and process credentials of the Linux kernel, as well as sensitive data in various user-space applications. Overall, our evaluation shows that xMP introduces minimal overhead for real-world workloads and applications, and offers effective protection against data-oriented attacks.",data oriented architecture,57

The TE goal is to maximise the residual capacity in the network so that the load is spread evenly. A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks. Allowing splittable flows means that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme can be used that has superior results when compared to existing constraint based routing schemes for flows that cannot be split. Consequently, this work demonstrates that the ICN architecture can simplify the given TE problem in a natural manner.",data oriented architecture,58

In our investigation we present the first comparative study of the construction of large applications in a parallel functional language, in our case in Glasgow Parallel Haskell (GPH). The applications cover a range of application areas, use several parallel programming paradigms, and are measured on two very different parallel architectures. 
 
On the applications level the most significant result is that we are able to achieve modest wall-clock speedups (between factors of 2 and 10) over the optimised sequential versions for all but one of the programs. Speedups are obtained even for programs that were not written with the intention of being parallelised. These gains are achieved with a relatively small programmer-effort. One reason for the relative ease of parallelisation is the use of evaluation strategies, a new parallel programming technique that separates the algorithm from the co-ordination of parallel behaviour. 
 
On the language level we show that the combination of lazy and parallel evaluation is useful for achieving a high level of abstraction. In particular we can describe top-level parallelism, and also preserve module abstraction by describing parallelism over the data structures provided at the module interface (‘data-oriented parallelism’). Furthermore, we find that the determinism of the language is helpful, as is the largely implicit nature of parallelism in GPH. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",data oriented architecture,61

This is about a data-oriented service which relies on sharing information resources (including public ones) and the requirements for interoperability, security and trust. This paper presents the main approaches to digital transformation based on the example of the most innovatively active sectors such as banking and healthcare. We compare the proprietary development of digital services (products) to the building of a digital sector ecosystem aimed at attracting an unlimited number of participants. We defined the purpose of creating an ecosystem that is to provide the population with digital services formed on demand, in real time, in compliance with legislation and regulations, as well as in the context of maximum trust. We emphasize the role of openness for uniting the efforts of the community interested in the development of a digital industry, extension of public-private partnerships and building a competitive environment in order to ensure the rapid growth of available digital services, as well as to improve their quality. Since the knowledge economy is the basis for the digital economy, the authors consider it especially important to form a semantic core which acts as the carrier of knowledge in a digital sector ecosystem. We confirmed the necessity to implement the semantic core by a brief analysis of modern semantic approaches to standardization of information sharing in the above-mentioned industries, such as FIBO, BIAN (banking), HL7 and UMLS (health). The research carried out allowed the authors to design the conceptual architecture of the ecosystem and to suggest several proposals for digital transformation of an industry.

Software and middleware is the soul of the CPS. The software development of CPS is a critical issue because of its complicity in a large scale realistic system. Furthermore, object-oriented approach (OOA) is often used to develop CPS software, which needs some improvements according to the characteristics of CPS. To develop software in a CPS environment, a new systematic approach is proposed in this paper. It comes from practice, and has been evolved from software companies. It consists of (A) Requirement analysis in event-oriented way, (B) architecture design in data-oriented way, (C) detailed design and coding in object-oriented way and (D) testing in event-oriented way. It is a new approach based on OOA; the difference when compared with OOA is that the proposed approach has different emphases and measures in every stage. It is more accord with the characteristics of event-driven CPS. In CPS software development, one should focus on the events more than the functions or objects. A case study of a smart home system is designed to reveal the effectiveness of the approach. It shows that the approach is also easy to be operated in the practice owing to some simplifications. The running result illustrates the validity of this approach.",data oriented architecture,71

Therefore, one can simply submit any arbitrary complex processing in the form of SQL queries or stored procedures to a database server. Data stream oriented applications are typically dealing with huge volumes of data. Storing data and performing off-line processing on this huge dataset can be costly, time consuming and impractical. This work describes our research results while designing and implementing an efficient data management system for online and off-line processing of data streams in the field of environmental monitoring. Our target data sources are wireless sensor networks. Although our focus is on a specific application domain, the results of this thesis are designed in a generic way, so that they can be applied to wide variety of data stream oriented applications. This thesis starts by first presenting the state-of-the-art in data stream processing research specifically window processing concepts, continuous queries, stream filtering query languages and in-network data processing (particular focus on TinyOS-based approaches). We present key existing data stream processing engines, their internal architecture and how they are compared to our platform, namely Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware. GSN middleware enables fast and flexible deployment and interconnection of sensor networks. It provides simple and uniform access to a comprehensive set of heterogeneous technologies. Additionally, GSN offers zero-programming deployment and data-oriented integration of sensor networks and supports dynamic re-configuration and adaptation at runtime. We present the virtual sensor concept, which offers a high-level view of arbitrary stream data sources, its powerful declarative specification and query tools. Furthermore, we describe design, conceptual, architectural and optimization decisions of GSN platform in detail. In order to achieve high efficiency while processing large volumes of streaming data using window-based continuous queries, we present a set of optimization algorithms and techniques to intelligently group and process different types of continuous queries. While adapting GSN to large scale sensor network deployments, we have encountered several performance bottlenecks. One of the challenges we faced was related to scalable delivery of streaming data for high data rate streams. We found out that we could dramatically improve the performance of a query processor by performing simple grouping of user queries hence sharing both the processing and memory costs among similar queries. Moreover, we encountered a similar performance issue while scheduling continuous queries. Problem of efficiently scheduling the execution of continuous queries with window and sliding parameters is not addressed in depth in literature. This problem becomes severe when one considers large volumes of high data rate streams. In these cases, an efficient query scheduler not only increases the performance at least by an order of magnitude but also, decreases the response time and memory requirements. Finally, we present how our GSN platform can get integrated with an external data sharing and visualization framework namely Microsoft's SenseWeb platform. Microsoft's SenseWeb platform, provides a sensor network data gathering and visualization infrastructure which is globally accessible to the end users. This integration (which is initiated by the Swiss Experiment project and demanded by GSN users) not only shows the scalability of GSN platform when combined with optimized algorithms, but also demonstrates its flexibility.",data oriented architecture,72

Classical Data-flow integrity, which is originally implemented purely on soft-ware platforms, can perform a good security effect against memory corruption attacks, particularly the newly proposed data-oriented programming attacks. However, it introduces high space and time overheads. To tackle these limitations of DFI, in this paper we present tagged memory supported data-flow integrity, TMDFI, a hardware data-flow integrity implementation to enable fine-grained DFI checks with reduced time and space overheads. Our hardware DFI proposal is based on lowRISC, an existing open-source tagged memory architecture targeting a RISC-V core. The tag fields are enlarged and adopted to keep the identifiers for run-time DFI enforcement. We modified the low-RISC architecture by adding a new instruction that performs multiple tags checking simultaneously and changing some native tag manipulation features. We tested our prototype on an RTL emulator. The result shows that the reduction of run-time overhead of a full inter-procedural DFI enforcement is from 104% to 39% and the space overhead shrinks from 50% to 12.5%.",data oriented architecture,76

Current concepts of content routing are built on data-driven protocol events and thereby introduce a strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of the distribution backbone. Based on a straight-forward analytical model we show that local systems cannot be protected from the threats of data-driven state management on an Internet scale. By practical evaluations using the example of the CCNx implementation, we further analyze threats to stability and performance of a data-driven infrastructure that refrains from separating the control from the data plane.

Google Chrome is the first commercial browser that adopts this architecture.

However, as billions of users now use web-based cloud services (e.g., Dropbox and Google Drive), which are integrated into the local system, the premise that browsers can effectively isolate the web from the local system has become questionable. In this paper, we argue that, if the process-based isolation disregards the same-origin policy as one of its goals, then its promise of maintaining the ""web/local system (local)"" separation is doubtful. Specifically, we show that existing memory vulnerabilities in Chrome's renderer can be used as a stepping-stone to drop executables/scripts in the local file system, install unwanted applications and misuse system sensors.

Thus, such attacks bypass binary-level protection mechanisms, including ASLR and in-memory partitioning.

One has concerned the construction of increasingly more powerful infrastructure for the support of open hypermedia navigation systems, while the other has concerned the application of hypermedia technologies and concepts to increasingly diverse domains. This dissertation addresses how these trends can be merged, resulting in a framework for design of powerful, general infrastructure. 
An examination of the domains to which hypermedia concepts have been applied yields to the conclusion that all rely on general structure and general structural computation. A philosophy of computation is presented called structural computing that stresses the primacy of these concepts. Without such a philosophy, structure is seen as an ad hoc functionality to be added over data-oriented programs. Different structure-oriented domains are seen as special cases of navigational hypertext, with a corresponding confusion of basic terminologies. 
An analysis of the historical development of hypermedia systems leads to the conclusion that current open hypermedia systems can be modified in a straightforward way to support structural computing by opening the link server layer in traditional hypermedia architectures. The resultant generalized link server is called a structure processor (Sproc). Different Sprocs encapsulate tailoring and extension of the structure and structural computation models provided by the structure store of the system. 
A conceptual architecture for an environment to support structural computing (named HOSS) is presented. This architecture is divided into two parts. The operating system layer describes the basic services available to all HOSS programs. The computing environment layer consists of an open set of programs that run address specific structural computing domains. A prototypic implementation of the operating system layer and several example computing environment layer programs is described, which provides a proof of concept of the structural computing environment architecture presented. The sample programs substantiate the claims that such an environment can support the design and implementation of a wide variety of structural computing programs. 
The dissertation concludes with an evaluation of the philosophy of structural computing and the design and implementation of HOSS, a description of directions for possible future work, and conclusions.",data oriented architecture,91

The continuously increasing size of the underlying graphs requires highly parallel in-memory graph processing engines that need to consider non-uniform memory access (NUMA) and concurrency issues to scale up on modern multiprocessor systems.

Hence, we present a classification of graph partitioning strategies and evaluate representative algorithms on medium and large-scale NUMA systems in this paper. As a scalable pattern matching processing infrastructure, we leverage a data-oriented architecture that preserves data locality and minimizes concurrency-related bottlenecks on NUMA systems.

One drawback of many of these proposals is the need to upgrade or replace all the routers in order for the new systems to work. Among the few systems that allow for gradual deployment is the recently-proposed Breadcrumbs technique for distributed coordination among caches in a cache network. Breadcrumbs uses information collected locally at each cache during past downloads to support in-network guiding of current requests to desired content. Specifically, during content download a series of short-term pointers, called breadcrumbs, is set up along the download path. Future requests for this content are initially routed towards the server which holds (a copy of) this content. However, if this route leads the request to a Breadcrumbs-supporting router, this router re-directs the request in the direction of the latest downloaded, using the aforementioned pointers. Thus, content requests are initially forwarded by a location ID (e.g., IP address), but encountering a breadcrumb entry can cause a shift over to content-based routing. This property enables the Breadcrumbs system to be deployed gradually, since it only enhances the existing location-based routing mechanism (i.e. IP-based routing). In this paper we evaluate the performance of a network where Breadcrumbs is only partially deployed. Our simulation results show Breadcrumbs performs poorly when sparsely deployed. However, if an overlay of Breadcrumbs-supporting routers is setup, system performance is greatly improved. We believe that the reduced load on servers achieved with even a limited deployment of Breadcrumbs-supporting routers, combined with the flexibility of being able to deploy the system gradually, should motivate further investigation and eventual deployment of Breadcrumbs.",data oriented architecture,97

Still, these platforms are typically programmed manually on a core-by-core basis; the most helpful tool that is widely accepted are library implementations of frequently used algorithms. This complicated task of multicore programming will grow further in complexity with the increasing numbers of cores. In addition, the constant change in architecture designs and thus in platform-specific programming demands will continue to make it laborious to migrate existing code to new platforms. State-of-the-art methods of automatic multicore code generation only partially meet the requirements of modern multicore platforms. They typically have a high overhead for different threads when growing numbers of cores and thus shrinking thread granularities demand the opposite. Also, they typically use message passing models for implementing data exchange when memory sharing should be the natural mode of data exchange. As a result, they often fail to produce efficient code, especially when large data throughput is required. This thesis proposes a data-oriented approach to multicore programming. It shows how dividing a program into discrete tasks with clearly specified inputs and outputs helps to formalise the problem of optimising high data throughput applications for a large range of multicore architectures, at the same time enabling an efficient, low-overhead implementation.

To achieve this, we combine three techniques: (i) periodic reordering of the heap, (ii) migrating local variables from the stack to the heap and (iii) pointer scrambling. By essentially flattening the dataflow graph of the program, the techniques serve to complicate static dataflow analysis and dynamic data tracking. Our methodology can be viewed as a data-oriented analogue of control-flow flattening techniques. Dataflow flattening is useful in practical scenarios like DRM, information-flow protection, and exploit resistance. Our prototype implementation compiles C programs into a binary for which every access to the heap is redirected through a memory management unit. Stack-based variables may be migrated to the heap, while pointer accesses and arithmetic may be scrambled and redirected.

Most of the human pose estimation networks are equipped with an image classification-based pose encoder for feature extraction and a handcrafted pose decoder for high-resolution representations. However, the pose encoder might be sub-optimal because of the gap between image classification and pose estimation. The widely used multi-scale feature fusion in pose decoder is still coarse and cannot provide sufficient high-resolution details for hard keypoints. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potential in many visual tasks to automatically search efficient networks. In this work, we present the Pose-native Network Architecture Search (PoseNAS) to simultaneously design a better pose encoder and pose decoder for pose estimation. Specifically, we directly search a data-oriented pose encoder with stacked searchable cells, which can provide an optimum feature extractor for the pose specific task. In the pose decoder, we exploit scale-adaptive fusion cells to promote rich information exchange across the multi-scale feature maps. Meanwhile, the pose decoder adopts a Fusion-and-Enhancement manner to progressively boost the high-resolution representations that are non-trivial for the precious prediction of hard keypoints. With the exquisitely designed search space and search strategy, PoseNAS can simultaneously search all modules in an end-to-end manner. PoseNAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets, MPII, COCO, and PoseTrack, with small-scale parameters compared with the existing methods.

Our model aims at parallel application programming, especially in th e field of data parallelism. We introduce coordinators shared objects which automatically perform synchronization in shared memory programming and remote communication in distributed programming. Programming with coordinators allows a static definition of dynamic access properties (shared access patterns) in a declarative manner. Thus, there is no need for explicit use of synchronization or communication primitiv es in order to get well defined and efficient parallel programs. In contrast, declarativity allows to think in abstract coor dination categories. Our paradigm is named Declarative Imperative Parallel Programming due to this fact and due to our commitment to imperative applications, mainly from the field of scientific computing, image processing, simulation and optimization. 1. The DIPP programming model Ideally, explicit parallel programming should be uniform for shared and distributed platforms. One way to achieve this is to give the programmer the illusion of shared memory even on distributed platforms[18]. While we think that this might be exactly what a programmer wants we must acknowledge that this goal is not reached yet. The performance issue implies some sort of discrimination of local from non-local data for distributed platforms. We believe that the process model can be uniform without any impact on performance. We propose such a model (a workpool model) in [13]. The aim of this paper is to show that even the data model can benefit from an uniform approach allowing architecture invariant programmin g without too much loss of performance. The relationship between our data model and the workpool is described in [14]. The main property of the approach presented in this paper is a paradigm which makes explicit synchronization or remote communication obsolete without performance degradation1. We introducecoordinators, a means for declaratively specifying the dynamic access properties of objects to be used by more than one process. The access properties directly correspond to algorithmic patterns typically found i data parallel algorithms such as fan-in or fan-out. In the context of message passing we have the related term broadcast. These all are specific cases of access patterns which can be defined by coordinators. The automatic coordination behavior of a system that implements coordinators can be derived from the specified patterns. Since coordinators are a declarative means to be used in imperative programming the programming model is named Declarative Imperative Parallel Programming. Imperativity is one of the properties which make coordinators different from other implicit synchronization paradigms such as futures [10]. See the discussion of related work for details. Coordinators are objects that may be accessed by more than one process in a coordinated fashion. In shared memory programming they might be named selfsynchronized objects. In distributed programming the term self-distributing might be in order. Accesses to coordinators may trigger synchronization or remote communication actions. We discriminate writing accesses (producers) from reading accesses (consumers). Note, that we do not support general producer-consumer aspects like buffering. In contras t, coordinators are a means for synchronized control allowing a tight coupling between producer and consumer. We 1Notice that we are concerned with application programming; we do not claim that our model does away with explicit synchroniza tion or coordination for parallel system programming such as operati ng systems or databases. specify access properties in a declarative manner: Access patterns are declared separately for reading and writing. The parallel semantics is defined by switching between a writableand areadablestate of a coordinator. The patterns statically describe the conditions which trigger the state switches. These conditions are defined in terms of “who reads or writes an object how many times”. Inappropriate (premature) accesses are delayed until the state switches. This behavior is implemented by implicit synchronization or communication, depending on the underlying architecture. 1.1. Dynamic behavior of coordinators The basic assumption about accesses to coordinators is that writing accesses are distinguished from reading accesses. In imperative programs, switches between writable and readabletypically occur repeatedly inside loops. In functional programs there is exactly one switch from writable to readable. 2 In the following, we informally describe the dynamic behavior of coordinators. Two state semantics Coordinators exhibit a two state semantics: A coordinator is initially in thewritablestate. After construction of the first value it switches to the readable state. After the last read access the coordinator switches t o thewritable state again, thus allowing multiple updates of objects. Depending on the access patterns defined for each state (see section 1.2), the switches may be triggered by dif ferent actions. Blocking If a coordinator is accessed and its state does not correspond to the access kind (i.e. a read access while the coordinator is writable and vice versa) the access is automatically blocked. Blocking lasts at least until the stat e has switched (e.g. by completion of some other accesses). By defining the switch conditions between the two states, the access patterns also determine blocking conditions. Computational steps Our focus is on iteratively writing and reading objects inside some loop or recursion. All such activities within one iteration are referred to as a computational step. More accurately, we define a computational stepwith respect to a coordinator as (dynamically) starting in the writable state and ending when this state is reached again, i.e. a computational step consists of a write phase and aread phase .3 2Readers familiar withfuturesor I-structuresmight see some relationship to these. 3In the functional world, the whole lifetime of a variable is a computational step. The semantics of coordinators is defined by their behavior during one computational step. In general, different co ordinators will carry out different computational steps. 1.2. De ning access patterns Every coordinator reveals a specific access pattern with respect to both phases of a computational step. The access patterns must be specified by the user separately for both phases. Access patterns correspond to algorithmic pat terns as they typically occur in “data-oriented” parallel a lgorithms (e.g. in numerical computation). We have defined the following patterns: each(<process group >,<no of accesses >) each(<process group >) arbitrary(<no of accesses >) arbitrary() The main patternseach and arbitrary differ in the mode of cooperation between the involved processes while their shapes denote the events that trigger a state change. Theeach pattern is used for a homogeneous group of processes <process group >, when the overall task within the write or read phase of a computational step can be defined by specifying the task of every single process within the phase. The intended standard way to specify such a task is to declare how many times the process will access the coordinator within the phase. To do so the each pattern is used with a<no of accesses > specification ( <no of accesses > will be 1 in many cases). This pattern fits for most algorithms that work on regular data (like arrays) in a regular fashion. If the number of accesses cannot be given, each process has to state explicitly that its task within a phase is finished by invoking the coordinator method procReady(<phase>). This method is parameterized with the phase, since it must be synchronized with concurrent accesses. Thus, a call to procReady is a further potential blocking situation. The state change is triggered as soon as each process has finished its task. In order to get a proper definition of this switch condition we require an invariable line-up of the pro cess group (except for an initial phase, see [13]). In contrast, thearbitrary pattern is used if an arbitrary, possibly varying number of possibly inhomogeneous processes share the coordinator. Within this cooperation mode, we can provide only global switch conditions: In the arbitrary pattern a<no of accesses > specification refers to the overall number of accesses, i.e. the state of the coordinator switches after exactly <no of accesses > accesses, no matter which processes were involved. Again, if the number of accesses cannot be given the state switch has to be triggered explicitly. In contrast to theeach pattern this is done by only one process, using the coordinator method switch(<phase>). It can be concluded that this pattern is appropriate e.g. for a farm work model where a centralized master controls the work of several slave processes. 1.3. A short example We illustrate the use of coordinators in a small example, using aC++ like notation enhanced with simple syntactic extensions. Our example implements a producer-consumer scenario where an integer variable sharedInt is repeatedly written by a single producer and subsequently read by nProcs different consumers. We ensure that each value written by the producer is read exactly once by each consumer, by simply definingsharedInt as a coordinator:",data oriented architecture,123

Methods in the literature rank data and partition them into groups of fixed-size; in the multivariate case, ranking is performed by projecting data vectors onto a single axis. In this paper, candidate optimal solutions to the multivariate and univariate microaggregation problems are characterized. In the univariate case, two heuristics based on hierarchical clustering and genetic algorithms are introduced which are data-oriented in that they try to preserve natural data aggregates.

Indeed, while Big Data is gaining the attention from the research community, also driven by some relevant technological innovations (like Clouds) as well as novel paradigms (like social networks), the issues of privacy and security of Big Data represent a fundamental problem in this research context, due to the fact Big Data are typically published online for supporting knowledge management and fruition processes and, in addition to this, such data are usually handled by multiple owners, with possible secure multi-part computation issues. Some of the hot topics in the context privacy and security of Big Data include: (i) privacy and security of Big Data integration and exchange; (ii) privacy and security of Big Data in data-intensive Cloud computing; (iii) system architectures in support of privacy and security of Big Data, e.g., GPUs: (iv) privacy and security issues of Big Data querying and analysis. These topics are first-class aspects to be addressed and investigated by PSBD 2014.

Many of these workflows have high computational, storage, and/or communication demands, and thus must execute on a wide range of large-scale platforms, from large clouds to upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Workflows will play a crucial role in the data-oriented and post-Moore's computing landscape as they democratize the application of cutting-edge research techniques, computationally intensive methods, and use of new computing platforms. As workflows continue to be adopted by scientific projects and user communities, they are becoming more complex. Workflows are increasingly composed of tasks that perform computations such as short machine learning inference, multi-node simulations, long-running machine learning model training, amongst others, and thus increasingly rely on heterogeneous architectures that include CPUs but also GPUs and accelerators. The workflow management system (WMS) technology landscape is currently segmented and presents significant barriers to entry due to the hundreds of seemingly comparable, yet incompatible, systems that exist. Another fundamental problem is that there are conflicting theoretical bases and abstractions for a WMS. Systems that use the same underlying abstractions can likely be translated between, which is not the case for systems that use different abstractions.

This paper puts forward a data-oriented access model for geographic information science data. First, we analyze the features of GIS data including traditional types such as vector and raster data and new types such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Taking into account these analyses, a classification scheme for geographic data is proposed and TRAFIE is introduced to describe the establishment of a multi-level model for geographic data. Based on this model, a multi-level, scalable access system for geospatial information is put forward. Users can select different levels of data according to their concrete application needs. Pull-based and push-based data access mechanisms based on this model are presented. A Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) was chosen for the data processing.

However, in-network caching brings about some new security issues (e.g., the separation of ownership and management of data). In native NDN architecture, consumers' requests are usually authenticated by a content producer, which results in highly computation overhead and unnecessary network delay. Moreover, in such a scenario where the connection between content producer and network is intermittent, encrypted contents cached in routers fail to be accessed by consumers due to lacking of content producer's permission. In this paper, we propose a collaborative data access control scheme for NDN, called CDAC, in which data access control is performed at cached-enabled routers rather than single content producer. In addition, enhanced secret sharing method is applied to achieve data access control in the situation where the connection between content producer and network is intermittent. We also use two-variable one-way function to reduce the computation overhead caused by consumer's revocation. Through reasonable security analysis and the comparison with preliminary works, the CDAC scheme achieves the expected design goals. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is efficient for N DN architecture, and introduces slight delay for contents securely retrieval.",data oriented architecture,141

Service providers are fiercely competing to improve customer satisfaction: providing services more quickly, notifying customers of exact recovery times, and supplying advanced new services. To improve customer satisfaction, all network operations and management (O&M) activities from customer services to administration have to flow smoothly and in cooperation with each other. A major factor in achieving this is an efficient information flow. An important aspect in this flow is that information must be readily available at any time and any place. To achieve global availability, the meaning, representation, and structure of the information must be systematized and standardized at an enterprise level and represented specifically at the local processing level. It is therefore necessary to construct O&M systems by using methodologies based on an information(data-) oriented perspective. An O&M system so constructed can be characterized as a strategic information system (SIS). Traditionally, O&M systems have been based on a process-oriented perspective and have been isolated from the flow of information. This paper describes the information engineering architecture we have developed for constructing a strategic network operation platform as an SIS. We have designed part of an information model based on this architecture and are studying the operation platform construction. 268 0-7803-181 1-0/94$04.00019941EEE Operation Systems: Present and Future Basic Structure of Process1 Qriented Operation Systems-df I .~.~..""-.,"""".~~.~.. .. .. ~ ......~...

Their data modeling and standardization are therefore done independently, so their data naming and data coding are not consistent. Information flows among these systems by means of paper and floppy disks, leading to duplicate data input, data transformation, and data inconsistency. The O&Ms are becoming strategic, advanced, and commercialized. For example, customers will be able to control their own networks, or they can let the service provider do it for them. To achieve strategic and advanced O&M, several O&M systems are needed and information must flow among them. In traditional vertically-structured systems, it is difficult to simplify data flow management, maintain data quality, and reduce data transformation costs. It is necessary to construct an information infrastructure which does not limit processing and managing data flows. The information needed by any O&M system must be immediately available, so information must be able to easily and quickly flow to all related O&M systems. From the view that ""Information is a final product which is gained by processing data"", it is necessary to construct O&M systems by using methodologies based on an information(data-) oriented perspective. We have developed a horizontally-structured O&M systems environment based on a data-oriented perspective. We call it an operation platform.",data oriented architecture,144

In order to efficiently exploit the data level parallelism, image processors include SIMD instructions and other parallel computation resources. Generic processors that can be purchased off-the-shelf are adequate for most of the use scenarios of image processing. However, especially with embedded mobile devices, they might not be optimal for the algorithm, the environment, or the energy budget at hand. Such cases call for programmable customized architectures with just enough hardware resources to ensure the high priority applications reach their real time goals with minimal overheads. In order to maintain high engineer productivity, implementing image algorithms for customized processors should be as easy as with standard processors. This is emphasized at the processor co-design time; because the program is used to drive the processor design space exploration towards an optimized architecture, assembly programming is not feasible due to the required porting effort whenever the architecture is modified. In this paper we propose an image processor customization flow that exploits the domain-specific Halide language as an input to a processor co-design environment. In addition to efficiently exploiting standard resources in the customized processors, the flow provides an easy way to invoke special instructions from Halide programs.

A big-data-driven application requires huge bandwidth and yet able to ensure low-power density. For example, web-searching application involves crawling, comparing, ranking, and paging of billions of web-pages with extensive memory access. The existing memory technologies have critical challenges of scaling at nano-scale due to process variation, leakage current and I/O access limitations. Recently, the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies such as resistive-RAM (ReRAM), spintransfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), domain-wall nanowire racetrack memory etc., have all shown significantly reduced standby power and increased integration density, not forgetting the close-to DRAM/SRAM access speed. Therefore, they are considered as promising candidates of universal memory for future big-data applications. The primary challenge to validate a hybrid design with both CMOS and nonvolatile devices is the lack of design platform that can validate the large-scale NVM circuit and system design accurately and efficiently. In addition, due to the use of non-electrical states of emerging NVM devices, new cells structures and their agreeing circuits for both read and write operations are needed to harness non-volatile memory with unique operations. For example, the transistor-free crossbar array that associates with NVM is different from conventional access transistor based memory structure. What is more, leveraging the NVM for computing, one also needs to examine the potential logic-inmemory computing architecture with significantly improved bandwidth and reduced power. In order to tackle above challenges ranging from device to system levels, this PhD thesis has explored the development of NVM design platform to support designs of non-volatile memories, readout and logic circuit designs, as well as the in-memory computing architecture. For the NVM design platform, the target is to perform accurate yet efficient circuit level simulation. The previous approaches either ignore dynamic effect without considering non-volatile states for dynamic behavior, or need equivalent circuits with high complexity to curve-fit non-linearity of those devices. We proposed a SPICE simulaiii tor named NVM-SPICE. This tool takes advantages of its new modified nodal analysis (MNA) framework, which can effectively support the non-electrical state variables of emerging non-volatile devices, such as ReRAM and spintronics devices. Due to the physics based modeling approach, NVM-SPICE is able to perform hybrid NVM/CMOS circuits efficiently and accurately. Compared to the equivalent circuit model based approach, the NVM-SPICE simulator exhibits more than 117x faster simulation speed for spintronics category devices and 40x faster speed for RRAM category devices. For NVM in-memory architecture, both memory elements and logic elements are implemented by emerging spintronics devices, which leads to a system purely composed of non-volatile devices. The detailed non-volatile memory and logic circuits are explored within the NVM-SPICE platform. In addition, logic is built inside the memory so that the I/O workload can be alleviated. Applications such as data retention, encryption, machine learning that play critical roles for big-data computing are explored within the non-volatile in-memory architecture. The evaluation results show that the purely non-volatile memory based platforms with in-memory architecture greatly contribute to power efficiency and throughput improvement for big-data oriented applications, and thus are potential candidates to be next generation information and communication technology.",data oriented architecture,152

It demonstrates the feasibility of our serviceoriented system in a real-world, resource-restricted WSAN based on off-the-shelf MICAz motes running the operation system TinyOS. In contrast to data-oriented approaches our service-oriented system does not only provide ”traditional” uni-directional data transfer (from sensor nodes to a base station), but also enables autonomous collaboration of sensor nodes. The nodes collaborate in the sense that the input of several sensors is used to trigger actuators, which in turn affect the sensor readings etc. For demonstration purposes we built an intelligent greenhouse that autonomously adapts its ambience in order to cultivate plants according to their individual and collective needs (see Figure 1). E.g., the lighting of the greenhouse is adapted considering all plants’ needs and the sunlight. For visualization we constructed a miniature version of the greenhouse with several plants. The greenhouse itself as well as the plants within are all equipped with various sensors and actuators in order to measure and modify the plants’ ecosystem (i.e. light and soil humidity). We also simulate external influence on the ecosystem, such as the influence of the sun on the greenhouse’s light control. Protocol details of our service-oriented system can be observed via a couple of PDAs connected to the sensor nodes. These PDAs allow for inspecting and changing the internal state of sensor nodes. Hence, attendees of the demonstration can use these PDAs to interact with the WSAN. We show two fundamental aspects of our Service-oriented Architecture in the demonstration: • Service description and execution: The intelligent greenhouse application is composed of services. The services are described and executed by Talassa (Tasking Language for Service-oriented Sensor-Actuator Networks [1]). • Secure lookup of available services: Services are stored in a distributed service directory, SCAN (Secure Content Addressable Network [2]). As this is a security critical component of our architecture, SCAN has been designed to provide secure service discovery. Talassa is a description language for distributed WSAN applications based on services. An application consists of a number of atomic services, which perform either basic hardware interaction or influence the control flow of other services. A virtual machine on each sensor node executes any of the above mentioned service types and provides inter-service new plant “sun”",data oriented architecture,154

We describe a simple logical-provenance specification language consisting of attribute mappings and filters. We provide an algorithm for provenance tracing in workflows where logical provenance for each transformation is specified using our language. We consider logical provenance in the relational setting, observing that for a class of Select-Project-Join (SPJ) transformations, logical provenance specifications encode minimal provenance.

In an exemplar-based approach, language acquisition is modeled as the incremental, data-oriented storage of experiential patterns, and language performance as the extrapolation of information from those stored patterns on the basis of a language-independent information-theoretic similarity metric. We show that this simple architecture works for many aspects of phonological, morphological, and morphosyntactic acquisition and processing. Furthermore, we sketch how the approach may also work for syntactic processing. A central insight of the approach, based on the results of computational modeling experiments, is that abstraction of representations is not only unnecessary to achieve generalization (i.e. to make the system productive, and to make it gòbeyond' the learned patterns), but even harmful, and that useful language-independent metrics can be found for deening similarity in the context of language processing. In the generative tradition, generality is achieved by means of abstraction, and the representations of choice to describe these abstractions are rules. This implies that redundancy and the storage of individual instances are to be avoided, except for exceptions to the generalizations expressed in rules. In Langacker, 1991 (Chapter 10), this methodology is critically examined, and cognitive grammar is described as an alternative usage-based model of language structure. In the latter, bottom-up, approach, patterns (rules, generalizations) and (redundant) instantiations of those rules are assumed to co-exist in the grammar, describing phenomena at all levels of generality, from exceptionless regularities to idiosyncratic exceptions. Rules are presumed to be necessary for the computation of novel instantiations. In the remainder of this paper we will introduce an exemplar-based approach to language acquisition and processing. The approach is in large part compatible with Lan-gacker's usage-based model, but is more radical in its ""maximalism"": language knowledge is supposed to consist only of ""instantiations"" (exemplars); there is no role for explicit abstractions corresponding to (sub)regularities. We will argue on the basis of computational modeling experiments that the adoption of abstractions (rules, patterns), taken as necessary for explaining generalization and productivity in both the generative and the cognitive grammar approach, is misguided. Furthermore, the exemplar-based approach contributes to making cognitive grammar ideas more concrete by providing computational operationalisations of both acquisition and processing in such a framework.",data oriented architecture,157

Named data networking is a promising future internet data oriented architecture which uses names instead of addresses and exchanges or forwards interest/data pair packets at each node along the path to route data for delivery. And meanwhile Network coding (NC) is a content oriented and effective method to reduce redundancy, increase network throughput and improve robustness. Nonetheless, due to NDN's current preliminary research, less research has combined these two technologies together.

On the other hand, HTTP is the most important protocol to deploy new services and applications on current TCP/IP-based Internet. In this paper, we attempt to run HTTP protocol on CCN and combine the two by stitching them semantically on their content-oriented features, such as content caching. We expect that this combination can be leveraged to build CCN testbed with real HTTP traffic which is vital to validation and redesigning of specific mechanisms of CCN and to finding a transition way of CCN in which great incentive is provided for service providers in the economic ecosystem of content distribution. We designed and implemented a HTTP-CCN gateway to transform HTTP request and HTTP response into CCN Interest and Data respectively. We illustrate how to semantically map HTTP caching to CCN caching, which is one of the most attractive properties of CCN. We also discuss how to achieve transparent caching with CCN and find out that it is nontrivial to achieve complete transparency of caching with CCN given no cooperation with CDNs and content providers.",data oriented architecture,161

However, the bit rate is limited to around 2 Mbps with limited mobility. Today, more applications demand high data rate and reasonable mobility. Therefore, by integrating 3G cellular system and wireless local area network (WLAN), there is a potential to push the data rate higher. This integration means 3G cellular users can enjoy high data rate at a location that is within WLAN coverage area. Similarly, WLAN users also can have data services as long as they are under the coverage of the 3G cellular system. The 3G cellular system has a much larger coverage than the WLAN.

Our approach uses sub-carrier multiplexed (SCM) architecture to combine and transmit 2.4 GHz WLAN and 1.9 GHz WCDMA signals through an optical fiber from a central base station (CBS) to a radio access point (RAP, single antenna unit). After the fiber, the signals continue to propagate through the air interface to respective mobile stations. The WLAN access point is also located at the CBS. For the SCM architecture, we investigate three areas: i) the signal to noise ratio of the uplink and the downlink, ii) the cell coverage area for the WCDMA and WLAN systems, and iii) the throughput of the IEEE 802.11b WLAN. Our results show that with up to 2.5 km cell radius, better than 18 dB SNR is possible with 5 km fiber link for WLAN system.

It is more developed than previous models, both in the description of hardware (e.g., the concept of the program counter, the structure of memory) as well as in the description of instructions (instruction codes, addresses). The structure of AMI over an arbitrary collection of mathematical domains N consists of: a non-empty set of objects, the instruction counter, a non-empty set of objects called instruction locations, a non-empty set of instruction codes, an instruction code for halting, a set of instructions that are ordered pairs with the first element being an instruction code and the second a finite sequence in which members are either objects of the AMI or elements of one of the domains included in N, a function that assigns to every object of AMI its kind that is either an instruction or an instruction location or an element of N, a function that assigns to every instruction its execution that is again a function mapping states of AMI into the set of states.

Responding to this gap, architects have introduced cache memories that are placed between processors and memories to mask high latencies. If cache misses are common, however, memory stalls can still significantly degrade execution time. To help identify and fix such memory bottlenecks, this work presents techniques to efficiently collect detailed information about program memory performance and effectively organize the data collected. These techniques help guide programmers or compilers to memory bottlenecks. They apply to both sequential and parallel applications and are embodied in the MemSpy performance monitoring system. 
Experiences performance tuning several programs have driven this research, leading to the following conclusions. First, this thesis contends that the natural interrelationship between program memory bottlenecks and program data structures mandates the use of data oriented statistics, a novel approach that associates program performance information with application data structures. Data oriented statistics, viewed alone or paired with traditional code oriented statistics, offer a powerful, new dimension for performance analysis. The dissertation develops techniques for aggregating statistics on similarly-used data structures and for extracting intuitive source-code names for statistics. 
Second, this thesis also argues that detailed statistics on the frequency and causes of cache misses are crucial in understanding memory bottlenecks. Common memory performance bugs are most easily distinguished by noting the causes of their resulting cache misses. Offering such information, MemSpy's performance profiles have been invaluable in analyzing memory bottlenecks in several applications. 
Third, since collecting such detailed information seems, at first glance, to require large execution time slowdowns, this dissertation also evaluates techniques to improve the performance of MemSpy's simulation-based monitoring. The first optimization, hit bypassing, improves simulation performance by specializing processing of cache hits. The second optimization, reference trace sampling, improves performance by simulating only sampled portions out of the full reference trace. Together, these optimizations reduce simulation time by nearly an order of magnitude. Overall, having used MemSpy to tune several applications, these experiences demonstrate that MemSpy generates effective memory performance profiles, at speeds competitive with previous, less detailed approaches.",data oriented architecture,171

ARC efforts have produced a wide variety of HPC architectures. A common HPC architectural pattern is multi-node compute clusters with low-latency, high-performance interconnect fabrics and shared central storage. This pattern enables processing of workloads with high data co-dependency, frequently solved with message passing interface (MPI) programming models, and then executed as batch jobs. Unfortunately, many HPC programming paradigms are not well suited to big data workloads which are often easily separable. Our approach lowers barriers of entry to HPC environments by enabling end users to utilize Apache Hadoop and Spark frameworks that support big data oriented programming paradigms appropriate for separable workloads in batch oriented HPC environments.",data oriented architecture,172

For some areas, such as high-integrity and safety-critical domains, this precision is imperative rather than optional. To address this issue, both academia and industry have been applying formal methods and formal verification techniques, where model checking and theorem proving are the most successful. Model checking is a verification technique that exhaustively searches the state space of a system represented by some formal notation. It became a successful technique applied by both academia and industry, due to its high level of automation and the ability to provide counter-examples as a debugging device in the case of failure. The difficulty of applying this technique is the state explosion problem that often happens in software verification, hence making such technique unsuitable for representation by computer. In order to finitely represent infinite state systems to be analysed by computer, one needs to resort to the more powerful technique of theorem proving. It allows precise description with less compromise on the state representation, as it uses symbols and quantifiers rather than actual values. The problem is that the higher the expressiveness of a notation, the lower the level of automation that it supports and greater the demand for user expertise and interactivity. The maturity of these techniques, as well as the wide availability of tools, pushed the demand for more expressive techniques with powerful automation tool support. Thus, combination of formalisms and their tools have become a topic of great interest in current research in formal methods. The combination of formalisms usually involve blending mature techniques that cover different aspects of software development in a common semantical framework. For instance, combining data oriented languages, such as Z and B, with behaviour oriented languages, such as CCS and CSP has been the focus of considerable research. The next step in this direction is to provide tool support for these combined languages. The combination of model checking and theorem proving have become the state-of-the-art in terms of tool development for formal verification techniques, as it combines expressiveness with high levels of automation. In this thesis, our main goal is to provide model checking support with integrated theorem proving for Circus, a concurrent language for refinement that combines Z, CSP, and the refinement calculus. Its semantic model is based on Hoare and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP), which provides an integrated theoretical framework for development and extension of different programming paradigms. From the partnership of our research group with QinetiQ Malvern, it is clear that there is demand for integrated formalisms and respective tool support. Our aim is to provide tool support for Circus, in order to allow its use in real applications, where we are able to formally specify different aspects of systems including, but not limited to, data and behaviour. As Circus is based in UTP, it is possible to integrate other aspects, such as mobility, and real-time, and research in these fronts is well advanced. To fulfill our goal, we provided an operational semantics for model checking Circus, which enables the representation of Circus programs as automata, as well as a search algorithm enabling us to establish refinement between two programs. Throughout the development process, we have decided to take our own medicine and use formal specification and verification, in order to increase the levels of integrity of our tools and techniques. The semantics and the underlying automata theory has been formally defined and mechanised in the Z/Eves theorem prover. Next, we proposed a model checking architecture, which integrates theorem proving facilities, and is implemented as a model checker prototype in Java. This architecture has been formally defined in Circus itself, and we augmented the Java code with JML annotations and assertions representing our findings from the formal specification. Finally, from the abstract Circus specification of the model checker architecture, we calculated a sequential refinement search algorithm using Circus refinement laws, where generated proof obligations have been discharged using Z/Eves again. This effort gave rise to a prototype model checking tool for Circus, which integrates refinement model checking with theorem proving in an extensible framework compliant with the Z Standard.",data oriented architecture,177

The traditional methods widely use delivery-testinganalysis-solving (DTAS) ring. In big data area, big data environment is necessary for the testing phase in DTAS, which results in the big cost in both time and hardware. This paper proposes the big data oriented light-load embedded performance modeling. It ascertains the performance criteria to set the Capacity and Performance (C&P) factors. These factors will be embedded into the software with an on-off switch during the architecture, design and developing phases before DTAS phase. After the software coding done with embedded C&P factors, a small traffic load is run to collect the C&P data. The collected data will be used for the performance bottleneck finding, performance optimization, and forecasting the capacity and performance for various customers’ scenarios. Since the data easily help locate the issue, the required running traffic is small, and the problem solving is done before the traditional DTAS, this study is more suitable for the big data application. It can save more than 50% of time, decrease the software development efforts, and reduce the lab resources occupation.

In this paper, we propose the ESN - PBA, a NDN producer mobility management scheme using the ESN in prediction to realize a lightweight machine learning based seamless handover algorithm. Better than the existing fixed and post-adjustment management schemes of producer mobility management, the ESN-PBA can perceive nodes movements heuristically and pre-configure the adjustment in advance to reduce overall processing overhead. In addition, with fine-grained home router status feedbacks and NDN content data oriented philosophy, the training process of normal machine learning method can be mutually enhanced. The experimental results in ndnSIM show that, in the case of successful prediction, the effect of seamless handover can be achieved straightly on the fly. In order to improve the hit rate of cache, we take advantage of NDN's multipath forwarding support, the utilization of ESN prediction of multiple candidates and synchronous forwarding. Compared with PIT-based approach and DNS-based approach, the handover delay of ESN-PBA reduces by 66.7% and 75% respectively.

Modern, future-proof architecture that provides better service quality, requires easier and cheaper maintenance, and consequently brings greater financial benefits is the main driving force for that action. In this moment, Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployment is a goal most mobile network operators are aspiring to. This paper describes presently ongoing changes in the mobile communication networks from the perspective of voice services they provide. Namely, LTE network is, so far, mainly recognized as a “data oriented” network. Having in mind enormous mobile data traffic increase, deployment of that kind of network is fully understandable and justified. However, voice services are still important part of telecommunications’ market offer. So, the above mentioned changes are leading not only toward satisfaction of growing needs regarding mobile data traffic, but also toward utilization of LTE network attributes for the purposes of voice communication. Complete transformation of mobile networks architecture and evolution of traditional voice communication will occur in the process. So far, that evolution has resulted with development of a mechanism know as voice over LTE. However, the mentioned changes are coming gradually and will take a certain time to be fully accomplished. In the meantime, some transition solutions are defined and deployed, in order to enable uninterrupted provisioning of voice services. Their description is included in the paper as well.

It emphasizes on the location of contents rather than producer of the same. ICN accomplishes it's objectives by supporting caching of content at internal nodes in the network. It also focuses on proper routing of content requests towards a suitable data source for efficient and timely delivery. Hence, routing and caching are two prominent areas of research in ICN. In this paper, a dynamic routing mechanism is proposed that utilizes the concept of likelihood time and betweenness centrality. In order to improve content retrieval latency, the content requests are routed to the nearest content locations, determined by the likelihood time of requested content and betweenness centrality of a node in the network. The routing strategy of the proposed scheme extends native Dijkstra's algorithm and works with the available caching mechanism. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated through exhaustive simulations in ndnSIM-2.0, which is a ns-3 driven NDN simulator. The observed simulation results depict that in realistically simulated network topology, the new protocol shows 5-8% of performance improvement over existing ICN routing strategy in terms of cache hit ratio, latency and packet overhead.",data oriented architecture,193

The third generation ""UMTS"" will provide wideband multimedia capabilities over mobile communication networks realising a range of new and innovative services, including interactive video, Internet/intarnet and other high speed data services. This leading to cellular network architectures that are to deliver infinite applications and infinite content of cost-effective mobile non-voice and voice services. This means more IP-optimised network and a change from a voice oriented to a data oriented platform. Faced with unprecedented growth in data volumes, the cellular air interface standards will have to support the demands of data rates of 144 kbits per second, portable data rates of 384 kbits per second and in-building fixed rate of 2 Mbits per second using WB-CDMA and TD-CDMA.",data oriented architecture,194

Depending on the architectural emphasis, there are different styles, for example, Three-tier architecture for a distributed system (interface, middleware, back-end database), Blackboard, Layered architectures, Model-View-Controller, Time-triggered and so forth. Architectural Design supports stakeholder communication, system analysis and large-scale reuse. It is possible to distinguish diverse design strategies: function oriented (sees the design of the functions as primary), data oriented (sees the data as the primary structured element and drives design from there), object oriented (sees objects as the primary element of design). There is no clear distinction between Sub-systems and modules. Intuitively, sub-systems are independent and composed of modules, have defined interfaces for communication with other sub-systems. Modules are system components and provide/make use of service(s) to/provided by other modules. The system architecture affects the quality attributes (e.g., performance, security, availability, modifiability, portability, reusability, testability, maintainability, etc.) of a system. It supports quality analysis (e.g., reviewing techniques, static analysis, simulation, performance analysis, prototyping, etc.). It allows to define (predictive) measures (i.e., metrics) on the design, but they are usually very dependent on the process in use. The software architecture is the fundamental framework for structuring the system. Different architectural models (e.g., system organizational models, modular decomposition models and control models) may be developed. Design decisions enhance system attributes like, for instance, performance (e.g., localize operations to minimize sub-system communication), security (e.g., use a layered architecture with critical assets in inner layers), safety (e.g., isolate safety-critical components), availability (e.g., include redundant components in the architecture) and maintainability (e.g., use fine-grain self-contained components).

Integration of electrical, electronics and computer science have led this technology more popular. Smart grid technology is characterized by full duplex communication, automatic metering infrastructure, renewable energy integration, distribution automation and complete monitoring and control of entire power grid. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are small micro electrical mechanical systems that are deployed to collect and communicate the data from surroundings. Security of wireless sensor based communication network is a major concern for researchers and developers. The address oriented design and development approach for usual communication network requires a paradigm shift to design data oriented WSN architecture.

Recently, there have been significant advances in file system technology in the form of cluster, distributed and/or parallel file systems in an attempt to break the I/O bottleneck plaguing the effective utilization of clusters of commodity computers. Successes have been achieved in scaling performance when defined as bandwidth, as typified by sequential access of large files using large I/O sizes. Applications with such access patterns does not represent all application classes to which cluster computing is being applied as a potential solution, the balance being those that access small and medium sized files in a random or sequential manner using small I/O sizes. Specifically, these access patterns perform as many and often more ""metadata"" operations on the file system as data reads or writes. Since metadata operations are at the heart of a file system and impact its integrity, scaling throughput or metadata performance through concurrency across many servers poses the most difficult technical challenge in file system design. This poster will present details about the fundamentally new architecture for constructing parallel file systems called segmented file system that scales linearly for both data and metadata oriented applications. Performance results will be presented with the IBRIX Fusion product (http:Wwww.ibrix.com) based on this architecture using micro benchmarks as well as real applications demonstrating the general-purpose scalability of this architecture. The poster will also show typical I/O cluster offerings from Dell that use IBRIX, using large cluster installations at universities and research labs as an example",data oriented architecture,197
