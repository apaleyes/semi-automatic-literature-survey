Such networks can be formed ad hoc by wire-less devices, such as mobile phones and laptops. In this work we use a data-centric architecture for opportunistic networks to evaluate data dis-semination overhead, congestion in nodes ’ buffer, and the impact of transfer ordering. Dissemination brings an overhead since data is replicated to be spread in the network and overhead leads to congestion, i.e., overloaded buffers. We develop and implement an emulation testbed to experimentally eval-uate properties of opportunistic networks. We evaluate the repeatability of experiments in the emulated testbed that is based on virtual computers. We show that the timing variations are on the order of milliseconds. The testbed was used to investigate overhead in data dissemination, congestion avoidance, and transfer ordering in opportunistic networks. We show that the overhead can be reduced by informing other nodes in the network about what data a node is carrying. Congestion avoidance was evaluated in terms of buffer management, since that is the available tool in an opportunistic network, to handle congestion. It was shown that replication information of data objects in the buffer yields the best results. We show that in a data-centric architecture were each data item is valued differently, transfer ordering is important to achieve delivery of the most valued data. 1 ",excluded

The system was divided into two independent parts. The first part is the data communication between the sensor network and the database. The other part is the data communication between the database and the user interface (UI). These two parts are connected by the database server. Asynchronous interoperation was introduced while exchanging data between these two parts. Users were not allowed to control the sensors through direct connection to the sensors and can only use the Web service to update the sensor profile built in the database. The sensors were triggered to start the action through a data-update event from the database. A sensor profile built in the database collected all sensor information and all user control command. For the information to be centralized and triggered by the database, regardless of whether sensors were measured in a periodic sampling or an event-driven environment, all sensor actions were triggered through a data-update event in the database. For the sake of improving user experience, a Web-based UI was implemented using scalable vector graphics (SVG) and Ajax technologies. All operations by users were conducted through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard method. Therefore, this system can be used via a browser and easily deployed. The proposed architecture is suitable for a healthcare system, a personal body area network, and the Infranet for control.",architecture

This work therefore investigates the resource management problem in sensing services, with application in audio sensing. First, a modular, data-centric architecture is proposed as the framework within which optimal resource management is studied. Next, the guided-processing principle is proposed to achieve optimized trade-off between resource (energy) and (inference) performance.

On cascade-based systems, empirical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the detection performance (up to 1.7x and 4x reduction in false-alarm and miss rate, respectively) for the same energy consumption, when compared to the duty-cycling approach. Furthermore, the guided-processing approach is also generalizable to graph-based systems. Resource-efficiency in the multiple-application setting is achieved through the feature-sharing principle. Once applied, the method results in a system that can achieve 9x resource saving and 1.43x improvement in detection performance in an example application.

Based on the encouraging results above, a prototype audio sensing service is built for demonstration. An interference-robust audio classification technique with limited training data would prove valuable within the service, so a novel algorithm with the desired properties is proposed. The technique combines AI-gram time-frequency representation and multidimensional dynamic time warping, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art using the prominent-region-based approach across a wide range of (synthetic, both stationary and transient) interference types and signal-to-interference ratios, and also on field recordings (with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves being 91% and 87%, respectively)",excluded

Data flowing through each input and output stream of every board are continuously copied to memory banks named Spy Buffers which act as built in logic state analyzers hooked continuously to internal data streams.

As a result, there is an increasing need for dynamic and self- adaptive QoS optimization solutions to respond to dynamic changes in SLA and the environment.
