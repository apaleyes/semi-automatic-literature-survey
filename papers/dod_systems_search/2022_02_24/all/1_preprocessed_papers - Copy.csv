Thus error detection and correction is a necessary technique in information technology. Cycle Redundancy Code, CRC, is a common method in error detection. A new method based on data-oriented theory for single and double bit errors correction by using CRC is presented. The conceptual model of presented method as data-oriented architecture is designed to implement it with hardware. This method is able to determine the exact place of one and two bits in error and correct them.

Named data networking is a promising future internet data oriented architecture which uses names instead of addresses and exchanges or forwards interest/data pair packets at each node along the path to route data for delivery. And meanwhile Network coding (NC) is a content oriented and effective method to reduce redundancy, increase network throughput and improve robustness. Nonetheless, due to NDN's current preliminary research, less research has combined these two technologies together. This paper presents some new thoughts to study on the benefits brought by integrating network coding to NDN, which can effectively improve network utilization, strengthen caching privacy, and also promote development of the NDN architecture itself.",data oriented architecture

Since unicast routing cannot exploit the natural broadcast property of wireless networks and unicast paths may be broken down frequently due to node mobility, broadcast transmission is applied for content delivery in information-centric multihop wireless networks. It will face two key challenges: which nodes that receive the broadcasted packet should forward it, and how to avoid multiple nodes simultaneously transmitting it. In this letter, we solve these two issues by taking node mobility and available link capacity into account. A mobility-based forward node selection algorithm is proposed, which tends to select the less mobility nodes as the forward ones. An available link capacity-based forwarding scheme is proposed, which tends to select forward nodes with larger available link capacities to forward packets.

However, in many corporations, this important process is fragmented and is undertaken without a farsighted plan to take advantage of an invaluable resource: data. This can be due to a variety of reasons, for example, lack of funding, poor business vision, inappropriate consulting or deployment. Digital transformation is a considerable investment since it will determine the system’s ability to grow and adapt to the company’s changing requirements. To achieve that end, the architecture must be flexible both in development and deployment and must also be able to harness the ever-increasing data of the corporation.

The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in bearing fault detection under all operational conditions.

To address these problems, we propose a radically new OS design based on data-centric architecture: all operating system state should be represented uniformly as database tables, and operations on this state should be made via queries from otherwise stateless tasks. This design makes it easy to scale and evolve the OS without whole-system refactoring, inspect and debug system state, upgrade components without downtime, manage decisions using machine learning, and implement sophisticated security features.

AFRL has led two efforts in SPA technology development to both solidify the SPA technology and to demonstrate the benefits. The Plug and Play Satellite (PnPSat) was the first spacecraft to utilize the SPA-S interface standard and demonstrated that rapid development, integration and testing is possible. PnPSat-2 integrates the next generation of radiation hardened SPA components on a larger bus focused on ORS needs. The SPA standard interface has proven critical to the development of design tools that both select (based upon performance requirements) and place (based upon restrictions such as mass and power balance) components. The Satellite Data Model (SDM) method of query and discovery enables the development of modular, single purpose applications that support autonomous flight software in a distributed computing system.

The project was conducted from 2012 to 2015 by a consortium consisting of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS), The Russian State Scientific Center for Robotics and Technical Cybernetics (RTC), S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (RSC “Energia”) and the Yuri A. Gagarin State Scientific Research-and-Testing Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC). DLR conducted two sets of experiments in which a cosmonaut on board the ISS used RJo to perform different tasks with robots located on-ground. The first was conducted with a 2-DoF robot equipped with a camera system, a task board and torque sensors that allowed the cosmonaut to perceive reactive forces caused by contacts with the environment. For the second set of experiments a humanoid robot was utilized to perform a tele-handshake, as well as a cooperative task between the cosmonaut on ISS and colleagues at RTC in St. Petersburg. To realize these experiments, the consortium developed onboard and on-ground software which are described in this paper. The space segment software consists of the control software for RJo and user interfaces on a laptop to guide the cosmonaut efficiently through the experiments. A state machine was designed for these user interfaces to capture state changes during the experiment execution. This way only relevant contextual information is provided to the cosmonaut. On RJo, a component framework has been deployed combining a data-centric architecture with a CCSDS Space Packet interface. Additionally, the communication software has been designed to support a direct multi-channel connection between ground control and ISS using the S-band radio equipment of the consortium. During contact to ISS, the ground operators used the ground segment software at DLR for experiment support, supervision, maintenance and data logging. The visual feedback from the camera system required by the cosmonaut to perform the experiments was provided by a low-latency video stream through a communication channel with very restricted bandwidth. 23 experiment sessions were carried out in 2015 utilizing the Kontur-2 software, which helped to validate telepresence technologies and study human factors for space applications.",data centric architecture

Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel method named SmartDetour to tackle the challenge in a distributed manner. SmartDetour contains two components: 1) a proactive reputation updating algorithm and 2) a reputation-based probabilistic forwarding strategy. The former updates the reputation of forwarding candidates based on whether they must be detoured upon packet failures.

Our system uses 2D charting tools to visualize the statistical relationships between simulation variables. We developed a Unity application to animate the 3D simulation in a virtual environment showing the time-varying results of the dynamics in a 3D environment. The Unity application runs on both a 2D high resolution display system and a complete-immersive Head Mounted Display device. The 2D visualization framework running on our Large High-Resolution Display system supports multiple coordinated views across all the 2D and 3D visualization components.

New hardware technologies, such as NVMe and SSD, have been introduced in burst buffer installations to reduce the pressure for external storage and boost the burstiness of modern I/O systems. The DMSH has demonstrated its strength and potential in practice. However, each layer of DMSH is an independent heterogeneous system and data movement among more layers is significantly more complex even without considering heterogeneity. How to efficiently utilize the DMSH is a subject of research facing the HPC community. Further, accessing data with a high-throughput and low-latency is more imperative than ever. Data prefetching is a well-known technique for hiding read latency by requesting data before it is needed to move it from a high-latency medium (e.g., disk) to a low-latency one (e.g., main memory). However, existing solutions do not consider the new deep memory and storage hierarchy and also suffer from under-utilization of prefetching resources and unnecessary evictions. Additionally, existing approaches implement a client-pull model where understanding the application’s I/O behavior drives prefetching decisions. Moving towards exascale, where machines run multiple applications concurrently by accessing files in a workflow, a more data-centric approach resolves challenges such as cache pollution and redundancy. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Hermes: a new, heterogeneous-aware, multi-tiered, dynamic, and distributed I/O buffering system. Hermes enables, manages, supervises, and, in some sense, extends I/O buffering to fully integrate into the DMSH. We introduce three novel data placement policies to efficiently utilize all layers and we present three novel techniques to perform memory, metadata, and communication management in hierarchical buffering systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of a truly hierarchical data prefetcher that adopts a server-push approach to data prefetching. Our evaluation shows that, in addition to automatic data movement through the hierarchy, Hermes can significantly accelerate I/O and outperforms by more than 2x state-of-the-art buffering platforms. Lastly, results show 10%–35% performance gains over existing prefetchers and over 50% when compared to systems with no prefetching.",data centric architecture

The main result of this paper is the definition and implementation of a context- and social-aware middleware able to share context information with all the interested components improving the efficiency and performances of services and protocols in opportunistic networks.

Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks were chosen as the machine learning algorithms for Quality of Experience prediction, and it was shown that they achieve high accuracy. Influence of wireless-specific parameters on QoE prediction was also investigated, and it was discovered that they are suitable for use in Quality of Experience prediction models.The problem is that; organizations do not know where they either have or may encounter weaknesses in their Enterprise Architecture with Data Driven Architecture (DDA). The framework presented is based on concepts from Wireless Networks with Driven Architecture will be designed to support both Transitional Gap Analysis (TGA) and Comparative Gap Analysis (CGA). TGA is supported by comparing a baseline Data Driven Architecture (DDA) to a target QoE where both DDA have been defined from the management perspective. DDA is facilitated by mapping a QoE to two or more 5G networks. The research methodology used in the paper is design science research for the QoE management based 5G network.

This enables an effective adaptation with the items and the environment, and ultimately, an increase in their grasping performance. These hands come with clear advantages in terms of ease-to-use and robustness if compared with classic rigid hands, when operated by a human. However, their potential for autonomous grasping is still largely unexplored, due to the lack of suitable control strategies. To address this issue, in this letter, we propose an approach to enable soft hands to autonomously grasp objects, starting from the observations of human strategies. A classifier realized through a deep neural network takes as input the visual information on the object to be grasped, and predicts which action a human would perform to achieve the goal. This information is hence used to select one among a set of human-inspired primitives, which define the evolution of the soft hand posture as a combination of anticipatory action and touch-based reactive grasp. The architecture is completed by the hardware component, which consists of an RGB camera to look at the scene, a 7-DoF manipulator, and a soft hand. The latter is equipped with inertial measurement units at the fingernails for detecting contact with the object. We extensively tested the proposed architecture with 20 objects, achieving a success rate of 81.1% over 111 grasps.",data driven architecture

Therefore, reuse and more importantly, managing the ever changing business requirements, become almost impossible. Service-orientation and architecture, model-driven business development provides us a new and powerful approach to facilitate asset based industry solution design and development. To further accelerate this, this tutorial will discuss an innovative approach that take advantage of many proven best software engineering practices, from object/component based technology, meta-data driven architecture types (archetypes) that are used to model the common structural and in some cases non-structural business entities such as customer, product, payment, etc. In order to address the consequences introduced by abstracting those common elements out of the specific industry model and be able to enable easy and meta-data based transformation, we properly decompose business components/services into a multi-layered business architecture. Therefore, process/components/services can be decomposed accordingly to facilitate the decomposition and abstraction, while maintaining certain level of necessary traceability across various artifacts. In the realization phase, existing assets/operational systems will be mapped and transformed to the required business components and services to best leverage those existing valuable industry/client investments. To support such a SOA based, model and business driven development process, existing tooling, especially the necessary transformation and integration capability, needs to be significantly enhanced. This tutorial will also present some recommendation based on some recent design and implementation, and they could be used to guide future tooling alignment and integration effort across software modeling, implementation and solution products.

Furthermore, in order to take better advantage of semantic relationship between seen and unseen classes by word vectors, auto-encoder is introduced to our framework to narrow the semantic gap and improve the recognition accuracy. Moreover, we utilize the ε-greedy based max-pooling technique to select the most relevant visual segment from an instance according to the label. Finally, we employ multi-task learning to overall optimize classification and ranking tasks in joint latent space. We evaluate our work on a weakly annotated human action dataset Charades. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both accuracy and efficiency.",data driven architecture

Graph networks provide a generalized form to exploit non-euclidean space data. A graph can be visualized as an aggregation of nodes and edges without having any order. Data-driven architecture tends to follow a fixed neural network trying to find the pattern in feature space. These strategies have successfully been applied to many applications for euclidean space data. Since graph data in a non-euclidean space does not follow any kind of order, these solutions can be applied to exploit the node relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) solve this problem by exploiting the relationships among graph data. Recent developments in computational hardware and optimization allow graph networks possible to learn the complex graph relationships. Graph networks are therefore being actively used to solve many problems including protein interface, classification, and learning representations of fingerprints.

For Chinese, the corresponding task is non-trivial because Chinese is a highly analytic language with flexible expressions. Additionally, noun phrases tend to be incomplete in grammatical structures, where clear mentions of predicates are often missing.

From a technical viewpoint, these sub-processes have to be concurrently executed and synchronized considering numerous interdependencies. So far, this coordination has mainly been accomplished manually, which has resulted in errors and inconsistencies. In order to deal with this problem, we have to better understand the interdependencies between the sub- processes to be coordinated. In particular, we can benefit from the fact that sub-processes are often correlated to the assembly of a product (represented by a product data structure). This information can be utilized for the modeling and execution of so-called data-driven process structures.

Typically, these systems are subject to limitations such as disturbances, systems delays, constraints, uncertainties, underperforming controllers, and unmodeled parameters that do not allow them to achieve the desired performance. In situations where it is not possible to redesign the closed-loop system, it is usual to incorporate a reference governor that instructs the system to follow a modified reference path such that the resultant path is close to the ideal one. Typically, strategies to design the reference governor need to know a model of the system, which can be an unfeasible task. In this paper, we propose a framework based on deep reinforcement learning that can learn a policy to generate a modified reference that improves the system’s performance in a non-invasive and model-free fashion. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present two challenging cases in engineering: a flight control with a pilot model that includes human reaction delays, and a mean-field control problem for a massive number of space-heating devices.

Furthermore, in a human-centric environment, the acquired knowledge must fulfill comprehensibility requirements so as to be shared by human users. In literature, several approaches have been proposed to acquire comprehensible knowledge from data by preserving a number of interpretability constraints, especially for Fuzzy Rule-Based Classifiers (FRBCs). As a general result, accuracy and interpretability emerge as conflicting features, so that a tradeoff is often required. In consequence of this tradeoff, the resulting FRBCs are provided with a knowledge base expressed in natural language but, as a matter of fact, the semantics embedded by the linguistic structures might not be cointensive with the explicit semantics defined in the knowledge base. As an alternative approach, in this paper we propose a technique to design FRBCs from data with the specific aim of maximizing interpretability in the sense of semantic cointension. The most important result of this approach is to control cointension so as to select models that possess knowledge bases that users can understand on the basis of their natural language description.

The system is affected by some additive stochastic disturbance and is subject to constraints that need to be appropriately accounted for in the design. By enforcing constraints to be satisfied for almost all disturbance realizations except for a set of probability ε, we can decide to what extent trading robustness for improving performance and also cope with the case of disturbance with unbounded support. Inspired by the existing literature, we propose a method to realize this trade-off, which combines the scenario approach to chance-constrained optimization with robust optimal control of piecewise affine systems. Interestingly, no explicit knowledge of the disturbance distribution is needed but only some disturbance realizations, thus resulting in a data-driven design method.",data driven architecture

Yet still very little is known about how to optimise the transmission of forces at the interface between the suit and the human body, with significant implications for comfort, efficiency and safety of the device. This work outlines the design and characterisation of a soft, textile-based exosuit for assistance of flexion/extension of the elbow joint, with emphasis on a data-driven design for optimising the efficiency of the transmission and the distribution of forces at the human-suit interface. Quantifying and understanding how design choices such as the materials used for transmitting power and the structure of the functional components of the suit affect these parameters can help us to improve the ergonomics, safety and effectiveness of such devices. Results obtained by comparing different Bowden cables constructions show that the ones with a linear-strand construction offer the highest efficiency and stiffness, lowest backlash and lowest viscous friction.

We show through analysis that DONet is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing DONet, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of DONet over the PlanetLab. Our experiments, involving almost all the active PlanetLab nodes, demonstrate that DONet achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions.

The optimizations proposed in this brief use the simple concept of hashing and lookup table to effectively reduce the number of arithmetic operations required to perform the FFT of an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. By reducing the dynamic power consumption and overall energy footprint of FFT computation, the proposed design aims to achieve longer battery life for a cardiac pacemaker. The design is synthesized using a 90-nm standard cell library, and gate level switching activity is simulated to obtain accurate power consumption results.

To overcome these drawbacks, we have developed a new T-S fuzzy system parameters searching strategy called OptiFel with a heterogeneous multiswarm PSO (MsPSO) to enhance the searching performance. MsPSO groups the whole population into multiple cooperative subswarms, which perform different search behaviors for the potential solutions. We have found that the multiple subswarms strategy proposed in this paper is greatly helpful for finding the optimal parameters suitable for the subspaces of the T-S fuzzy model. Our theoretical proof has also demonstrated that the cooperation among the subswarms can maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation to ensure the particles converge to stable points. Experimental results show that MsPSO performs significantly better than traditional PSO algorithms on six benchmark functions. With the improved MsPSO, OptiFel can generate a good fuzzy system model with high accuracy and strong generalization ability.",data driven architecture

Moreover, as the most distinctive mechanical property of the cable structures, different applied tension generates different lateral stiffness on the main cable. Without an integrated analysis model, the realistic profile of the cable structures cannot be determined. In this regard, this paper proposes a master digital model for a suspension bridge based on the data-driven approach for multiple purposes, including the structural assessment aspect. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) technique is a key factor to creating and federate all the essential engineering knowledge data regarding a suspension bridge. At first, a data schema for the suspension bridge’s main structures is created and based on that, the database for each structural member is defined. The BIM authoring using the data-driven design is proposed to generate all the individual structural members then assembly to make the entire initial model for the suspension bridge. Metadata is linked, and any efficient revisions concerning varying situations during the construction process can be easily updated into the digital model through the change of database. Finally, an analysis model is integrated into this initial model to create the federated master digital model. The advantage of this master digital model lies in the capability to continuously perform the bridge system’s stability analyses at any erection step. Furthermore, it makes the digital representation of the main cable and suspended bridge structures more dynamic, no longer just rigid objects in the general commercial BIM model.

Because of the nature of a deep generative model, the generated material distributions are diverse and inherit features of the training data, that is, the elite material distributions. Therefore, it is expected that some of the generated material distributions are superior to the current elite material distributions, and by merging the generated material distributions with the dataset, the performances of the newly selected elite material distributions are improved.

In the present work, we achieve this goal using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE).

In the CVAE model, a shape is fed as an input and the corresponding aerodynamic performance index is fed as a continuous label. Then, shapes are generated by specifying the continuous label and latent vector. When CVAE is applied to mechanical design, it is desired to draw shapes that reproduce the specified aerodynamic performance. In ordinal CVAE, the model is trained to minimize reconstruction loss and latent loss, and it is usually optimized considering the sum of these losses. However, the present study shows that the optimal network is not always optimal in terms of reproducing the aerodynamic performance.

One is the mode of intervention, which can range from providing expert knowledge to the client to engaging in a collaborative process. The second dimension is the number of people involved in the design process, which can range from just a few members of the leadership team to groups of up to thousands (in so-called large group interventions). The approach described here uses a collaborative approach that engages a design team of a manageable size. The design team represents the organization and is mandated by the leadership team to perform the design work. Elements of approaches from other design disciplines can offer useful inspiration for the organization design approach, such as the importance of prototyping and testing. Still, a lot of challenging aspects of the design process remain, especially having to do with the inevitable political aspects at play. Data-driven tools that support the organization design process are increasingly on offer. They may offer support in analyzing the current situation, in prototyping design options, and even in generating new designs.",data driven architecture

By analyzing the generated data, it is possible to create optimized outputs for structures in an iterative process, until reaching a solution that satisfies the project constraints. Often, it is challenging to conciliate optimization with issuing of intermediate versions to be used for project coordination by other stakeholders. This is due to recurrent project changes, related to architectural or client requirements that arise during the design process. Moreover, structural design is generally carried out in a variety of software by different engineers within the design team. Therefore, it is rather challenging to organize, control and analyze all the information generated in structural design at each step, aiming to enhance both general team efficiency and structural optimization. The increasing popularity of BIM (Building Information Modeling) in this field could be a pivoting factor towards data-driven design and informed decision-making in all levels of a structural project team. In this context, this paper presents a proposal and an application of a BIM data workflow to enhance the work of structural designers as well as the collaboration within the design team. The workflow is based on data extraction through visual programming, using Dynamo, and the creation of an automatically updatable dashboard within Power BI. Python is used to create custom-build operations that apply specifically to the structural assessment context. Discussion about the suitability of this process for other applications within decision-making activities in structural engineering is also given.",data driven architecture

Using familiar results from passivity-based and energy-shaping control literature, this control function is determined by the appropriate gradients of a neural network, acting as an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We encode the task of swinging-up robotic systems through the use of transverse coordinates and goal sets; which drastically accelerates the rate of learning by providing a concise target for the neural network. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm with both numerical simulations and experiments.",data driven architecture

As a result, unit cells are either assumed to be repeated (periodic) everywhere or limited to a small number of shapes. To address these limitations, this work proposes a data-driven design framework consisting of a metamaterial genome with a reduced-order geometrical representation as well as methods for the efficient design and analysis of 2D aperiodic metamaterials with compatible boundaries. To collect a large amount of designs, a set of unit cells generated by topology optimization is taken as initial seeds for the genome, and then expanded iteratively through random shape perturbations to form a rich database that covers a wide range of properties. For a reduced-order representation, the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) spectrum is adopted to describe complex unit cell shapes using a low number of descriptors, therefore significantly reducing the design dimensionality. Moreover, the physical and geometrical information contained in the LB spectrum is revealed through both quantitative and theoretical analysis. This information as well as the lower dimensionality allows the genome to be effectively leveraged to build a neural network model of structure-property relations for the rapid design of new unit cells. Finally, the combination of the metamaterial genome with an efficient optimization method based on the Markov random field (MRF) model is proposed to ensure connected boundaries between unit cells in multiscale aperiodic microstructure designs.",data driven architecture

Two design variables are considered for each lattice substructure, one discrete variable indicating the configuration type and the other continuous density variable determining the geometrical feature size. For each lattice configuration, a series of similar lattice substructures are sampled by varying the density variable and a corresponding data-driven interpolation model is built for an explicit representation of the constitutive behavior. To reduce the model complexity, substructuring by means of static condensation is performed on the sampled lattice substructures. To achieve hybrid structure with multiple lattice configurations, a multi-material interpolation model is adopted by synthesizing the data-driven interpolation models and the discrete lattice configuration variables. The proposed approach has proved capable of generating hierarchically strongly coupled designs, which therefore allows for direct manufacturing with no post-processing requirement as required for homogenization-based designs due to the assumption on scales separation.",data driven architecture

Initial DFT screening led to the identification of chromium (Cr) and tin (Sn) as potential substituents for alloy design. Then, trained ML models predict Sn substitution to be more promising than Cr-substitution for tuning the T _C of FeGe.

With this respect, a method is proposed addressing the business and data understanding in industrial contexts and corresponding Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) environments. This allows to identify use cases for data-driven design taking into account business processes as well as the related data. In the proposed method, first the main process tasks are analyzed using a SIPOC analysis that is followed by a process decomposition to further detail and highlight corresponding applications using Enterprise Architecture principles. Following this, value stream mapping and design process failure mode effect analysis are used to identify sources of waste and the related causes. With this, a feature analysis of given data is proposed to identify use cases and enable to further use standard data science methods like CRISP-DM. The method is validated using the infrastructure of the Pilotfabrik at TU Vienna. The use case shows the applicability of the method to identify features that influence the cost of a product during the manufacturing without changing the functional specifications. The results highlight that different methods need to be combined to attain a comprehensive business and data understanding. Further, a comprehensive view of the processes is yielded that enables to further identify use cases for data-driven design.

Then, we use statistical and accessibility analyses to determine the spaces residents appreciate the most and those in need of enhancements. We observe that patients’ sociability is strongly related to the considered factors.

Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies that can mitigate current CO_2 emissions^ 2 , much effort is focused on developing solid adsorbents that can efficiently capture CO_2 from flue gases emitted from anthropogenic sources^ 3 . One class of materials that has attracted considerable interest in this context is metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful combination of organic ligands with metal-ion nodes can, in principle, give rise to innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO_2 from nitrogen^ 4 – 7 do not perform well when using realistic flue gas that contains water, because water competes with CO_2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their selectivity. Although flue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process prohibitively expensive^ 8 , 9 . Here we show that data mining of a computational screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify different classes of strong CO_2-binding sites—which we term ‘adsorbaphores’—that endow MOFs with CO_2/N_2 selectivity that persists in wet flue gases. We subsequently synthesized two water-stable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their carbon-capture performance is not affected by water and outperforms that of some commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting and consideration of the full capture process—including the targeted CO_2 sink, such as geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industry—will be necessary to identify the optimal separation material. Data mining of a computational library of metal–organic frameworks identifies motifs that bind CO_2 sufficiently strongly and whose uptake is not affected by water, with application for the capture of CO_2 from flue gases.",data driven architecture

In the current study, we reanalysed data from two studies using a game-based assessment and a training tool for improving fraction magnitude knowledge. Similar to results from basic research, data of both studies indicated that performance in game-based versions of number line estimation and magnitude comparison were highly correlated (even after controlling for students’ overall math achievement). This suggests that both tasks share an underlying (spatial) representation of number magnitude. Based on this we designed a new task to improve fraction learning.

If a user-centered design recapitulates existing knowledge, then a design approach which derives exclusively from the data may provide more innovative results. Our approach considers both the designers and the users, whereby our goal is to elicit creativity in both the design of visualization tools and in their application.

This paper presents MIRA, a framework for defining and implementing Semantic Interfaces for Web applications, including those on the Semantic Web. A Semantic Interface is defined as being one capable of understanding and adapting to the data it presents and captures, and its schema, if present. Moreover, the interface must also be able to adapt to its context of use – the device being used, any available information about its user, network conditions, and so on. Using a model-driven approach, MIRA allows developers to define such interfaces, and generates code that can run on clients, servers or both.

Using the resulting components, a mapping between the loading configurations and the optimal topologies is learned.

The compiler generates graphs with various-sized actors in order to match the characteristics of the computation. For instance, vector actors are proposed for many aspects of scientific computing while lower resolution (complier-generated collection of scalar actors) or higher resolution (scalar actors) is used for unvectorizable programs. A block-scheduling technique for extracting more parallelism from sequential constructs is incorporated in the decoupled architecture. In addition a graph-level priority-scheduling mechanism is implemented that improves resource utilization and yields higher performance.

descriptor space, existing metamaterial datasets suffer from property
distributions that are either highly imbalanced or at odds with design tasks of

from generative models, fit a sparse regressor as the start-up agent, and
leverage diversity-related metrics to drive data acquisition to areas that help
designers fulfill design goals. We validate the proposed framework in three
hypothetical deployment scenarios, which encompass general use, task-aware use,
and tailorable use. Two large-scale shape-only mechanical metamaterial datasets

several bicycle frames under different loading conditions, identify
non-dominated design candidates that perform well on multiple objectives, and
explore correlations between structural objectives. Our analysis shows that

When one actually wants to make such an optical device, one can predict its
optical behavior using computational simulations of Maxwell's equations. If one
then asks what the optimal design would be in order to obtain a certain optical
behavior, the only way to go further would be to try out all of the possible
designs and compute the electromagnetic spectrum they produce. When there are
many design parameters, this brute force approach quickly becomes too
computationally expensive. We therefore need other methods to create optimal
optical devices. An alternative to the brute force approach is inverse design.
In this paradigm, one starts from the desired optical response of a material
and then determines the design parameters that are needed to obtain this
optical response. There are many algorithms known in the literature that
implement this inverse design. Some of the best performing, recent approaches
are based on Deep Learning. The central idea is to train a neural network to
predict the optical response for given design parameters. Since neural networks
are completely differentiable, we can compute gradients of the response with
respect to the design parameters. We can use these gradients to update the
design parameters and get an optical response closer to the one we want. This
allows us to obtain an optimal design much faster compared to the brute force
approach. In my thesis, I use Deep Learning for the inverse design of the
Fabry-P\'erot resonator. This system can be described fully analytically and is
therefore ideal to study.",data driven architecture

materials directly from the images of their representative microstructures with
arbitrary component distributions. The measure of elastic isotropy for
architectured materials is derived firstly in this paper to construct a
database with associated images of microstructures. Then a convolutional neural
network is trained with the database. It is found that the convolutional neural
network shows good performance on the isotropy identification. Meanwhile, it
exhibits enough robustness to maintain the performance under fluctuated
material properties in practical fabrications. Moreover, the well-trained
convolutional neural network can be successfully transferred among different
types of architectured materials, including two-phase composites and porous
materials, which greatly enhance the efficiency of the deep learning-based
approach. This study can give new inspirations on the fast mechanical
characterization for the big-data driven design of architectured materials.",data driven architecture

the dependence on data induces a unique challenge: An imbalanced dataset

trade-off between shape and property diversity so that subsets can be tuned for
various applications. Through the design of 2D metamaterials with target

improve the search process as well as structural performance. By eliminating

While distinctions between various aspects of the design process are diminishing, a need for a novel, more inclusive toolset arises. The ‘tangible table’ paradigm is an attempt at combining intuitive ways of physical modelling with data-driven design strategies and the interactive simulation of naturally occurring phenomena. Despite its existence for more than 20 years, tangible tables have mainly focused on very specific workflows and therefore have not found wider adoption in landscape architectural practice or education. We list the limitations of previous implementations and introduce a novel software solution aimed at popularizing tangible table setups. Our software is embedded in a widespread visual programming environment, which allows for straightforward augmentation of physical models with computational design tech-niques. Using a week-long PhD course as a case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed software and its potential applications to solving various landscape architectural challenges through increased emphasis on participatory processes.Peer reviewe",data driven architecture

One of the European Union directives indicates that 10% of all fuels must be bio-synthesized by 2020. In this regard, biobutanolnatively produced by clostridial strainsposes as a promising alternative biofuel. One possible approach to overcome the difficulties of the industrial exploration of the native producers is the expression of more suitable pathways in robust microorganisms such as Escherichia coli. The enumeration of novel pathways is a powerful tool, allowing to identify non-obvious combinations of enzymes to produce a target compound.

Results
This work describes the in silico driven design of E. coli strains able to produce butanol via 2-oxoglutarate by a novel pathway. This butanol pathway was generated by a hypergraph algorithm and selected from an initial set of 105,954 different routes by successively applying different filters, such as stoichiometric feasibility, size and novelty. The implementation of this pathway involved seven catalytic steps and required the insertion of nine heterologous genes from various sources in E. coli distributed in three plasmids. Expressing butanol genes in E. coli K12 and cultivation in High-Density Medium formulation seem to favor butanol accumulation via the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. The maximum butanol titer obtained was 85±1 mg L1 by cultivating the cells in bioreactors.

Conclusions
In this work, we were able to successfully translate the computational analysis into in vivo applications, designing novel strains of E. coli able to produce n-butanol via an innovative pathway. Our results demonstrate that enumeration algorithms can broad the spectrum of butanol producing pathways. This validation encourages further research to other target compounds.This study was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) under the scope of a Ph.D. Grant (PD/BD/52366/2013) from MIT Portugal Program and the strategic funding of UID/BIO/04469 unit.

EPA is an important and expensive dietary supplement with a promising and very competitive market, which is dependent on fish-oil extraction. This has prompted several research groups to study biotechnological routes to obtain specific fatty acids rather than a mixture of various lipids. Moreover, microorganisms can use low cost carbon sources for lipid production, thus reducing production costs. Previous studies have highlighted the production of EPA by P. irregulare, exploiting diverse low cost carbon sources that are produced in large amounts, such as vinasse, glycerol, and food wastewater.

These event-driven approaches are mainly used in dynamic scheduling or rescheduling systems. Unlike those, Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 production environments integrate the physical and decision-making aspects of manufacturing processes in order to achieve their decentralization and autonomy. On these grounds we propose a data-driven architecture for scheduling, in which the system has real time access to data. Then, scheduling decisions can be made ahead of time, on the basis of more information. This promising approach is based on the architecture of cyber-physical systems, with a data-driven engine that uses, in particular, Big Data techniques to extract vital information for Industry 4.0 systems.Fil: Rossit, Daniel Alejandro.

The design environment gets more open often involving crowdsourcing and the design process becomes more complex, considering product family design along product whole lifecycle development, and needing more data support. Therefore, it is critical to effectively capture, share, and manage design-related information in such a complex design environment. From this perspective, it is a prerequisite to have a proper product design lifecycle information model (PDLIM) to guide information gathering, sharing and management. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there lacks such a PDLIM to support effective PDD, though digital twin (DT) technology shows a great potential of supporting product lifecycle information collection and management. In this paper, the overall structure of the proposed PDLIM is firstly developed to frame in all main product lifecycle stages and the corresponding key phases for structurally capturing and storing necessary data along a product lifecycle. Secondly, key design information items against the main product lifecycle stages and their corresponding key phases are explored from literature reviews and case study analyses. Thirdly, the necessity of the identified information items in the PDLIM is qualitatively evaluated by two case studies. Finally, the PDLIM is further evaluated by applying formal object-role modelling (ORM) to demonstrate how design information items are used and interacted in exemplary design interaction scenarios, and to approve that it can be formally described and managed as an information model. The evaluation results show that the PDLIM is feasible to be adapted in a crowdsourcing-combined PDD process for supporting design management, reviewing, quality control, and next round product redesign and improvement",data driven architecture

Materials informatics and data-driven materials science are umbrella terms for the scientific practice of systematically extracting knowledge from data produced in materials science. This practice differs from traditional scientific approaches in materials research by the volume of processed data and the more automated way information is extracted. This data-driven approach — sometimes referred to as the 4th paradigm of science — is largely driven by the use of modern hardware and software for data production and storage, the Open Science movement and the methodological developments in data mining and machine learning. 
This dissertation reviews how materials informatics can be effectively applied to accelerate materials science, focusing on computational, atomistic materials modelling. The topic is divided into two different areas: how the data-driven design and tools are being used to re-imagine the life-cycle of materials data and how machine learning, in particular, can be used to complement existing research methodologies in materials science. These topics are explored by investigating the historical development of materials informatics and by highlighting the modern tools and techniques.  
This discussion provides a guide for anyone interested in deploying these methods in their research and also covers some of the key challenges that the field of materials informatics still faces. After this overview, the original materials informatics research performed during the studies is summarized. First, the open-source software libraries developed for materials informatics are introduced. These libraries deal specifically with tasks related to the automated structural classification of complex atomistic geometries and the efficient description of materials for machine learning. Next, the studies related to materials discovery using data mining and machine learning are discussed.

Tämä eroaa perinteisistä tieteellisistä lähestymistavoista, sillä prosessoidun tiedon määrä on suurempi vaatien lähes täysin automatisoituja menetelmiä. Tätä datalähtöistä lähestymistapaa on myös kutsuttu tieteen neljänneksi paradigmaksi. Se syntyyn ovat vaikuttaneet kyky tuottaa ja tallentaa suuria tietomääriä modernin tietokonelaitteiston ja -ohjelmiston avulla, avoimen tieteen periaatteiden käyttöönotto sekä tiedon louhintaan ja koneoppimiseen käytettyjen menetelmien kehitys.

However, manual encoding of clinical data into machine-readable forms is laborious and subject to observer bias. Natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records has great potential to enhance reproducibility at scale but suffers from idiosyncrasies in physician notes and other medical records. We developed methods to optimize NLP outputs for automated diagnosis. We filtered NLP-extracted Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to more closely resemble manually extracted terms and identified filter parameters across a three-dimensional space for optimal gene prioritization. We then developed a tiered pipeline that reduces manual effort by prioritizing smaller subsets of genes to consider for genetic diagnosis. Our filtering pipeline enabled NLP-based extraction of HPO terms to serve as a sufficient replacement for manual extraction in 92% of prospectively evaluated cases. In 75% of cases, the correct causal gene was ranked higher with our applied filters than without any filters. We describe a framework that can maximize the utility of NLP-based phenotype extraction for gene prioritization and diagnosis. The framework is implemented within a cloud-based modular architecture that can be deployed across health and research institutions",data driven architecture

Incorporating data creatively and critically as design material can help us learn and understand user needs better. Therefore, design can bring deeper meaning to data, just as data can enhance design practice. Accordingly, this work raises a reflection on whether designers could appropriate the workflow of data science in order to integrate it into the research process in the creative process within a framework of user experience analysis. The proposed model: data-driven design model, enhances the exploratory design of problem space and assists in the creation of ideas during the conceptual design phase.

Hence, it is challenging to study community dynamics and important to create model systems of reduced complexity that mimic major community functions. Therefore, we developed MiMiC, a computational approach for data‐driven design of simplified communities from shotgun metagenomes. We first built a comprehensive database of species‐level bacterial and archaeal genomes (n = 22 627) consisting of binary (presence/absence) vectors of protein families (Pfam = 17 929). MiMiC predicts the composition of minimal consortia using an iterative scoring system based on maximal match‐to‐mismatch ratios between this database and the Pfam binary vector of any input metagenome. Pfam vectorization retained enough resolution to distinguish metagenomic profiles between six environmental and host‐derived microbial communities (n = 937). The calculated number of species per minimal community ranged between 5 and 11, with MiMiC selected communities better recapitulating the functional repertoire of the original samples than randomly selected species. The inferred minimal communities retained habitat‐specific features and were substantially different from communities consisting of most abundant members. The use of a mixture of known microbes revealed the ability to select 23 of 25 target species from the entire genome database.

Researchers have proposed protecting privacy by aggregating user data before it reaches the utility, using techniques of homomorphic encryption to prevent exposure of unaggregated values. However, such schemes generally require users to trust in the correct operation of a single aggregation server. We propose two alternative systems based on secret sharing techniques that distribute this trust among multiple service providers, protecting user privacy against a misbehaving server. We also provide an extensive evaluation of the systems considered, comparing their robustness to privacy compromise, error handling, computational performance, and data transmission costs. We conclude that while all the systems should be computationally feasible on smart meters, the two methods based on secret sharing require much less computation while also providing better protection against corrupted aggregators.

The 1920s and 1930s provide rich examples of promoting the relationship between research and design, as many modern protagonists claimed their designs resulted from analyzed data and expert input rather than historical reference or creative talent. Scientists, economists, engineers, and architects alike investigated problems such as hygiene conditions in housing and cities, human needs at work and home, construction mechanization, and traffic optimization as the basis and justification of spatial designs. As an example, this paper addresses the discourse on best solar orientation of housing, with the architect and urbanist Ludwig Hilberseimer as one of several proponents of this discourse, among them Walter Gropius, Ernst May, and Le Corbusier. Regarding solar studies, Hilberseimer's projects and writings can be divided into three phases. The first phase is marked by his famous 1920s renderings of the residential city and high-rise metropolis, which conform to the orientation recommendations by urban planners Richard Baumeister and Karl Hoepfner. The second phase spans Hilberseimer's teaching at the Bauhaus from 1929 to 1933, in which he contributed to the extensive solar studies for diverse housing types undertaken at the Bauhaus building department. A third phase, in which he applied the findings to ""settlement units” in linear city patterns, came to full fruition after 1938 when Hilberseimer started teaching at the Armour Institute, later renamed the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. The case of solar studies in High Modernism and Hilberseimer's work in particular illuminate the challenges of relating research, performance-driven design, and actual building projects.

The merit of the proposed approach is that it can produce fast PI parameter tuning without using any plant model by measuring the I/O data of the system. Moreover, the proposed PI parameters that are varied based on sigmoid function of angular velocity error has great potential in improving the control performance compared to the conventional PI controller.

Therefore, most applications to the early design phases are passed by as simple overarching ideas informed by the designer and users’ knowledge. Although this is a preferred method of choice making, the knowledge used to inform conceptual and schematic design process can be limited. With the increase of computation in all major industries, a new increase in data to describe forms of infrastructure is required. These forms being objects to analyze their performance and potential, and active forms that can describe the disposition of urban space. Previous research into data driven design has worked its way into standardization and performance goals. However, the connection between active and object forms as a network of standards has yet to be introduced as a method of advising design. Meaning design has focused on creating a single object that seems to benefit the ecology. No attempt at connecting urban active data to object data has been made to benefit both forms equally, but only to preserve the status quo. The introduction of Machine learning algorithms has the capability to connect these complex forms and inform new designs. The application of machine learning algorithms advises the early phases of architectural design process by reviewing a manifold of data, privileging complex analogical connections, and simulating the designers informed symbolic choices.

The objective of this research is aimed at addressing the challenges raised by the new data-driven design paradigm for smart products development, in which the product itself and the smartness require to be carefully co-constructed.
A smart product can be seen as specific compositions and configurations of its physical components to form the body, its analytics models to implement the intelligence, evolving along its lifecycle stages. Based on this view, the contribution of this research is to expand the “Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)” concept traditionally for physical products to data-based products. As a result, a Smart Products Lifecycle Management (sPLM) framework is conceptualized based on a high-dimensional Smart Product Hypercube (sPH) representation and decomposition.
First, the sPLM addresses the interoperability issues by developing a Smart Component data model to uniformly represent and compose physical component models created by engineers and analytics models created by data scientists. Second, the sPLM implements an NPD3 process model that incorporates formal data analytics process into the new product development (NPD) process model, in order to support the transdisciplinary information flows and team interactions between engineers and data scientists.

Many of today's industrial processes are becoming more complex, and modeling accurate physical models for these plants using first principles may be impossible. With the increased developments in the computing world, large amounts of measured data can be easily collected and stored for processing purposes. Data can also be collected and used in an on-line fashion. Thus it would be very sensible to make full use of this data for controller design, performance evaluation, and stability analysis. The design methods imposed in this work ensure that the dynamics of a system are captured in an experiment and avoids the problem of unmodeled dynamics associated with parametric models. The devised methods consider robust designs for both linear-time-invariant (LTI) single-input-single-output (SISO) systems and certain classes of nonlinear systems. 

In this dissertation, a data-driven approach using the frequency response function of a system is proposed for designing robust controllers with H&infin; performance. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for obtaining H&infin; performance while guaranteeing the closed-loop stability of a system. A convex optimization algorithm is implemented to obtain the controller parameters which ensure system robustness; the controller is robust with respect to the frequency-dependent uncertainties of the frequency response function. For a certain class of nonlinearities, the proposed method can be used to obtain a best-linear-approximation with an associated frequency dependent uncertainty to guarantee the stability and performance for the underlying linear system that is subject to nonlinear distortions.

The concepts behind these design methods are then used to devise necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring the closed-loop stability of systems with sector-bounded nonlinearities. The conditions are simple convex feasibility constraints which can be used to stabilize systems with multi-model uncertainty. Additionally, a method is proposed for obtaining H&infin; performance for an approximate model (i.e., describing function) of a sector-bounded nonlinearity. 

This work also proposes several data-driven methods for designing robust fixed-structure controllers with H&infin; performance. One method considers the solution to a non-convex problem, while another method convexifies the problem and implements an iterative algorithm to obtain the local solution (which can also consider H2 performance).

The effectiveness of the proposed method(s) is illustrated by considering several case studies that require robust controllers for achieving the desired performance. The main applicative work in this dissertation is with respect to a power converter control system at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) (which is used to control the current in a magnet to produce the desired field in controlling particle trajectories in accelerators).

The wrong formulation can render a drug product useless. The amount of preclinical (animal and in vitro) work that must be done before a new drug candidate can be tested in humans can be a problem. The cost of these cGxP studies is typically $3-$5 million. If the wrong drug product formulation is tested, new iterations of the formulation must be tested with additional costs.  Data-driven computational science can help reduce this cost. In the absence of existing human exposure, a battery of preclinical tests must be performed in at least two species before FDA will permit testing in humans. However, for many drugs (such as those beginning with natural products) there is a history of human exposure. In these cases, computer modeling of a population to determine human exposure may be adequate to permit phase 1 studies with a candidate formulation in humans.

We suggest that the key role of interface design is to manage these frictions by guiding action in such a way to minimise negative affective states at key thresholds of the application process. The management of friction is enabled by practices of data-driven design, where the contingency of human response is engineered through analytics in order to increase rates of application. Working through the example of High-Cost Short-Term Credit, the paper complicates a notion of control as a smooth or automatic operation of power, instead emphasising the necessity of both continuity and discontinuity as key to modulating action in a digital age.

Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies that can mitigate current CO2 emissions2, much effort is focused on developing solid adsorbents that can efficiently capture CO2 from flue gases emitted from anthropogenic sources3. One class of materials that has attracted considerable interest in this context is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful combination of organic ligands with metal-ion nodes can, in principle, give rise to innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO2 from nitrogen4-7 do not perform well when using realistic flue gas that contains water, because water competes with CO2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their selectivity. Although flue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process prohibitively expensive8,9. Here we show that data mining of a computational screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify different classes of strong CO2-binding sites-which we term 'adsorbaphores'-that endow MOFs with CO2/N2 selectivity that persists in wet flue gases. We subsequently synthesized two water-stable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their carbon-capture performance is not affected by water and outperforms that of some commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting and consideration of the full capture process-including the targeted CO2 sink, such as geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industry-will be necessary to identify the optimal separation material",data driven architecture

Similarity identification is one of basic problems in data-driven design and can facilitate many engineering applications and product paradigm such as quality control and mass customization. Therefore, reusing information can create unprecedented opportunities in advancing the theory, method, and practice of product design. To enable information reuse, different models have to be aligned so that their similarity can be identified. This alignment is commonly known as the global registration that finds an optimal rigid transformation to align two 3D shapes (scene and model) without any assumptions on their initial positions. The Super 4-Points Congruent Sets (S4PCS) is a popular algorithm used for this shape registration. While S4PCS performs the registration using a set of 4 coplanar points, we find that incorporating the volumetric information of the models can improve the robustness and the efficiency of the algorithm, which are particularly important for mass customization. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Volumetric 4PCS (V4PCS), to extend the 4 coplanar points to non-coplanar ones for global registration, and theoretically demonstrate the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Experimental tests are conducted on a number of models such as tooth aligner and hearing aid to compare with S4PCS. The experimental results show that the proposed V4PCS can achieve a maximum of 20 times speedup and can successfully compute the valid transformation with very limited number of sample points. An application of the proposed method in mass customization is also investigated",data driven architecture

Simulation results obtained from the generated designs agree well with the input reflection spectrum.

This new workflow is tested against other existing methods of shading device design in terms of performance and aesthetics. The workflow presented in this paper demonstrates the optimization of fixed shading devices for cooling and heating loads without limiting aesthetic options or the shading device typology at the beginning of the process. This workflow produces iterations that perform similarly in terms of energy savings so that a designer can select a shading device based on other criteria such as aesthetic concerns or constructability issues. The user can move between different shading typologies and add their own creative, artistic interpretations, while not being required to run many simulations after each design change. This paper demonstrates a process that is more in-line with the building design process.

information security is becoming more important to organizations as the internet and cloud technologies become more integrated with their internal processes. the number of attacks and attack vectors has been increasing steadily over the years. border defense measures (e.g. intrusion detection systems) are no longer enough to identify and stop attackers.
data driven information security is not a new approach to solving information security; however there is an increased emphasis on combining heterogeneous sources to
gain a broader view of the problem instead of isolated systems. stitching together multiple alerts into a cohesive system can increase the number of true positives.

Therefore, users of cloud resources are embracing the more promising cloud federation model to ensure service guarantees. Here, users have the option of selecting between multiple cloud providers and subsequently switching to a more reliable one in the event of a provider's inability to meet its SLA.

Given the unpredictable, dynamic and on-demand nature of the cloud, it would be unrealistic to assume that optimal QoS can be achieved at design time. As a result, there is an increasing need for dynamic and self- adaptive QoS optimization solutions to respond to dynamic changes in SLA and the environment. In this context, we posit that the challenge of self-adaptive QoS optimization encompasses two dynamics, which are related to QoS sensitivity and conflicting objectives at runtime. We propose novel design of a dynamic data-driven architecture for optimizing QoS influenced by those dynamics. The architecture leverages on DDDAS primitives by employing distributed simulations and symbiotic feedback loops, to dynamically adapt decision making metaheuristics, which optimizes for QoS tradeoffs in cloud-based systems.

The model utilizes previously collected data on thumb motor performance and posture for different tap locations and thumb movement directions. We calculated a performance index (PITOT, 0 is worst and 2 is best) for 663 designs consisting in different combinations of three variables: the keyboard's radius of curvature (R) (mm), orientation (O) (°), and vertical location on the screen (L). The current standard keyboard performed poorly (PITOT = 0.28) compared to other designs considered. Keyboard location (L) contributed to the greatest variability in performance out of the three design variables, suggesting that designers should modify this variable first. Performance was greatest for designs in the middle keyboard location. In addition, having a slightly upward curve (R = −20 mm) and orientated perpendicular to the thumb's long axis (O = −20°) improved performance to PITOT = 1.97. Poorest performances were associated with placement of the keyboard's spacebar in the bottom right corner of the screen (e.g., the worst was for R = 20 mm, O = 40°, L = Bottom (PITOT = 0.09)).

To deal with normal variations in the process, the parameters of residual generator are online updated by standard adaptive technique to achieve reliable fault detection performance. After a fault is successfully detected, the isolation scheme will be activated, in which each isolation observer serves as an indicator corresponding to occurrence of a particular type of fault in the process. The thresholds can be determined analytically or through estimating the probability density function of related variables. To illustrate the performance of proposed fault diagnosis approach, a laboratory-scale three-tank system is finally utilized.

In order to deal with this problem, we have to better understand the interdependencies between the subprocesses to be coordinated. In particular, we can benefit from the fact that sub-processes are often correlated to the assembly of a product (represented by a product data structure).

From an historical standpoint, 3DRTS started principally as homebrew developments. The underlined consequences are the lack of standardization for producing such applications. Nowadays, computers hardware can reproduce close to photo-realism 3D images within interactive environments. This was made possible with the continuous improvements in computers hardware. During many years, the hardware evolution was following vertical speed-up improvements, by increasing CPU clocks speed and memory bandwidth. Today, we are reaching the limits of this approach from a power consumption, heat, and intrinsic materials characteristics perspectives. As an outcome, the next-generation of computer hardware and home consoles are presenting multitasking architectures. This obliges to re-think software development for 3DRTS, moving from the serial and single-threaded approach to a concurrent design. We explore conceptual designs handling the current scale and complexity offered by 3DRTS developments by adopting stronger engineering practices. This is needed to control the underlined complexity and rising developments costs. The direct consequence of being able to generate highly detailed virtual worlds is to involve more deeply artists and designers in the development process. We propose mechanisms that free developers from common low-levels problematic, such as memory management or data synchronization issues. Our architecture relies on extending the Component Based Development (CBD) model for multitasking architectures. This obliges to define specific patterns either directly inspired by other fields in computer science or dedicated for 3DRTS. This includes promoting multi-layer design where the low-level routines are tightly connected to computer hardware by describing the importance of conceiving hardware-oblivious systems. This is important, as memory bandwidth is becoming the principal bottleneck in current applications. Another fundamental aspect consists to move from the single iterative global loop commonly found in single-threaded systems, by incorporating mechanisms for balancing the workflow more accurately. If those optimizations and evolutions are required for assuring efficient real-time performance, they do not allow non-programmers to interact with the system with ease. Our method consists to promote high-level languages and concurrent model relying on Microthreads. This gives the ability to develop and execute scripts in a multitasking environment without the common C/C++ issues. This is primordial to let designers experiment with ideas in a safer and efficient environment. This will leads to adopt the data-driven paradigm to control agents in our simulations, by clearly separating the logic and data layers. This offer better flexibility and reduce the existence of simulation specific code. In addition, we illustrate that the best technology and designs have a limited meaning, if they do not come with a complete production pipeline for managing and controlling simulation assets. This also affects fine tuning parameters where different hardware may perform better in some areas or worse in other. Finally, different use-cases demonstrate the strong and weakness aspects of our approach",data driven architecture

In this work we use a data-centric architecture for opportunistic networks to evaluate data dis-semination overhead, congestion in nodes ’ buffer, and the impact of transfer ordering. Dissemination brings an overhead since data is replicated to be spread in the network and overhead leads to congestion, i.e., overloaded buffers. We develop and implement an emulation testbed to experimentally eval-uate properties of opportunistic networks. We evaluate the repeatability of experiments in the emulated testbed that is based on virtual computers. We show that the timing variations are on the order of milliseconds. The testbed was used to investigate overhead in data dissemination, congestion avoidance, and transfer ordering in opportunistic networks. We show that the overhead can be reduced by informing other nodes in the network about what data a node is carrying. Congestion avoidance was evaluated in terms of buffer management, since that is the available tool in an opportunistic network, to handle congestion. It was shown that replication information of data objects in the buffer yields the best results. We show that in a data-centric architecture were each data item is valued differently, transfer ordering is important to achieve delivery of the most valued data. 1 ",data centric architecture

Named Data Networking (NDN) recently emerges as a promising networking paradigm in supporting IoT due to its data-centric architecture. In this dissertation, we present our research on design a scalable, efficient and secure ndn-based data retrieval framework for Internet of Things. Our work includes three parts:First, we envision an NDN-based Connected Vehicles (CV) application framework with a distributed data service model, as CV is a typical scenario of IoT. The scalability of the framework is greatly challenged by the fast mobility and vast moving area of vehicles. To handle such an issue, we develop a novel hyperbolic hierarchical NDN backbone architecture (H2NDN) by exploiting the location dependency of CV applications. H2NDN designs the backbone routers topology and the data/interest namespace by following the hierarchical architecture of geographic locations. The efficient data searching only requires static forwarding information base (FIB) configuration over NDN routers. To avoid overloading high-level routers, H2NDN integrates hyperbolic routing through carefully designed hyperbolic planes.Second, a distributed adaptive caching strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of data caches on NDN routers. NDN provides native support to cache data at routers for future Interest packets. As we model the caching problem, the goal of cache allocation is to maximize the savings of Interest/Data forwarding hops under the limited cache space on each router. We discuss the impracticality of global optimization and provide the local caching method. Extensive ndnSIM based simulation with real traffic data proves the efficiency and scalability of the proposed H2NDN architecture.Finally, although NDN provides some security advantages such as secures data directly and uses name semantics to enable applications to reason about security, employing NDN to support IoT applications nevertheless presents some new challenges about security. In this dissertation, we focus on two resultant attacks that are not effectively handled in current studies, namely the targeted blackhole attack and the targeted content poisoning attack. We propose a lightweight and efficient approach named SmartDetour to tackle the two attacks. To ensure high scalability and collusion-resilience, SmartDetour lets each router respond to attacks (i.e., packet drops or corrupted data) independently in order to isolate attackers. The core solution contains a reputation-based probabilistic forwarding strategy and a proactive attacker detection algorithm. Extensive ndnSIM based simulation demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed SmartDetour",data centric architecture

The Internet of Things makes human activity data — what people do, how they move, how they socialise — an abundant resource.

Being personal, contextual and accessible, mobile devices are key facilitators of (ir)responsible collection and use of data. In this workshop, we will use the Future Workshop approach to develop a research agenda towards ethical data-centric design of intelligent behaviours. As part of this approach, we will (1) criticise the current mechanisms and infrastructure to frame ethical challenges, (2) fantasise on futures which support user and designer values, and (3) implement a research agenda for the MobileHCI community to emphasise the barriers to tackle.

This work therefore investigates the resource management problem in sensing services, with application in audio sensing. First, a modular, data-centric architecture is proposed as the framework within which optimal resource management is studied. Next, the guided-processing principle is proposed to achieve optimized trade-off between resource (energy) and (inference) performance.

On cascade-based systems, empirical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the detection performance (up to 1.7x and 4x reduction in false-alarm and miss rate, respectively) for the same energy consumption, when compared to the duty-cycling approach. Furthermore, the guided-processing approach is also generalizable to graph-based systems. Resource-efficiency in the multiple-application setting is achieved through the feature-sharing principle. Once applied, the method results in a system that can achieve 9x resource saving and 1.43x improvement in detection performance in an example application.

Based on the encouraging results above, a prototype audio sensing service is built for demonstration. An interference-robust audio classification technique with limited training data would prove valuable within the service, so a novel algorithm with the desired properties is proposed. The technique combines AI-gram time-frequency representation and multidimensional dynamic time warping, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art using the prominent-region-based approach across a wide range of (synthetic, both stationary and transient) interference types and signal-to-interference ratios, and also on field recordings (with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves being 91% and 87%, respectively)",data centric architecture

By unifying specification andimplementation, our approach avoids the common problem of implementationsdiverging from specifications over time.  In addition, we show that using adeclarative language often results in drastic reductions in code size (100× andmore) relative to procedural languages like Java and C++.  We demonstrate theseadvantages by implementing a host of functionalities at various levels of thesystem hierarchy, including network protocols, query optimizers, and schedulingpolicies.  In addition to providing a compact and optimized implementation, wedemonstrate that our declarative implementations often map very naturally totraditional specifications: in many cases they are line-by-line translations ofpublished pseudcode.We started this work with the hypothesis that declarative languages --originally developed for the purposes of data management and querying -- couldbe fruitfully adapted to the specification and implementation of core systeminfrastructure.  A similar argument had been made for networking protocols afew years earlier [61].  However, our goals were quite different: we wanted toexplore a broader range of algorithms and functionalities (dynamic programming,scheduling, program rewriting, and system auditing) that were part of complex,real-world software systems.  We identified two existing system components --query optimizers in a DBMS and task schedulers in a cloud computing system --that we felt would be better specified via a declarative language.  Given ourinterest in delivering real-world software, a key challenge was identifying theright system boundary that would permit meaningful declarative implementationsto coexist within existing imperative system architectures.  We found thatrelations were a natural boundary for maintaining the ongoing system state onwhich the imperative and declarative code was based, and provided an elegantway to model system architectures.This thesis explores the boundaries of declarative systems via two projects.We begin with Evita Raced; an extensible compiler for the Overlog language usedin our declarative networking system, P2.

High-powered SE tools (MagicDraw, Cradle, Core, etc.) tend to be specialized and are available only to highly trained Systems Engineers, and/or through the use of a 'back room' developer team making the output products available to the broader team. On the other hand, highly accessible tools (MS Word, Excel, etc.) do not have the power to implement SE in a rigorous manner. NASA has to test all aspects of the new human-rated Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle spacecraft prior to its first crewed mission. The test program includes uncrewed launch abort flight tests to demonstrate the capability to save the crew in the event that a launch failure occurs. Orion's second abort flight test will be a low-altitude flight test known as ""Ascent Abort 2 (AA-2).""  This test is currently scheduled to be carried out at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 46 (SLC-46) in Florida in 2019. NASA's in-house AA-2 Crew Module and Separation Ring (CSR) Team is producing the crew module and separation ring. Operating jointly as both an Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Project and an Orion Project, the CSR project charter includes development of innovative, streamlined and generally more efficient practices for creation of flight hardware and software. One result of this tasking has been development of a collaborative and data-centric systems engineering environment within the team's shared web environment (Microsoft SharePoint). Through the use of built-in, 'out of the box capabilities' present in MS SharePoint, the CSR Systems Engineering team has created (with some limited developer support) a data-centric architecture for the project's SE implementation, including functional and interface analysis, requirements development and management, risk management, verification planning and management, test results, and end item management. Data elements are linked between data structures so as to define and control relationships between item types, link requirements to parents and children, and link tests to the requirements that they verify. The overall project team integration is increased by also linking SE content to project management content over the project life cycle, including team communication, action items, configuration management, decisional and meeting materials, and life cycle reviews. This presentation will provide an overview of the collaborative SE environment, showing how it provides the power for a number of SE tasks while still providing the accessibility and transparency to allow the full project team to collaborate and succeed. Given the project phase, we'll be able to present a nearly full lifecycle discussion, from concept through verification and approaching delivery",data centric architecture

Ao longo das últimas décadas, as inovações em tecnologias da informação e comunicação vêm proporcionando diversas transformações no mercado de consumo e alterando o comportamento dos usuários. Essas modificações ocorrem nos diferentes pontos da jornada de consumo, seja no modo como os usuários pesquisam, adquirem, utilizam, avaliam ou descartam produtos e serviços. Consequentemente, o aumento da quantidade de dados digitais (big data) e do volume de tráfego on-line tem sido exponencial. Por meio da análise de big data é possível obter novo e/ou melhor entendimento acerca do comportamento humano de modo a influenciá-lo. Entretanto, muitas dessas análises estão sendo utilizadas como instrumentos para estimular o consumo. Neste cenário, os comportamentos de consumo dos últimos 50 anos têm contribuído para os impactos negativos na sustentabilidade, como por exemplo, para o aumento da temperatura do planeta.

In recent decades, innovations in information and communication technologies have brought about several transformations in the costumers market and changed the users' behavior. These changes occur at different points in the customer journey, whether in the way users search, buy, use, evaluate or discard products and services. Consequently, the amount of digital data (big data) and the volume of online traffic has been increasing exponentially. Through big data analytics, it is possible to gain a new and/or better understanding of human behavior to influence it. However, many of these analyzes are being used as instruments to encourage consumption. In this scenario, the consumption behavior of the last 50 years contributed to negative impacts on sustainability, such as the increase in the planet's temperature. On the other hand, big data investigations can also present opportunities for Data-Driven Design for Sustainable Behaviour, such as developing meta-project briefings for a product; service; Product+Service Systems (PSS); public policies. Therefore, this study aimed to propose Data-Driven Design for Sustainable Behaviour Meta-Project Briefing Guidelines.

When aggregated waste practices have significant sustainability impacts. Digital technologies designed to raise awareness of environmental issues compete for our finite cognitive capacity with the demands of everyday life. To address this challenge, this paper uses speculative design of domestic waste devices. These speculative ‘data objects’ build on work in speculative design, sustainable HCI, and waste infrastructure mapping.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether an automated platform for evaluation selection and delivery would increase participation from surgical teaching faculty in submitting resident operative performance evaluations.  DESIGN:
We built a HIPAA-compliant, web-based platform to track resident operative assignments and to link embedded evaluation instruments to procedure type. The platform matched appropriate evaluations to surgeons\u27 scheduled procedures, and delivered multiple evaluation types, including Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (O-Score) evaluations and Operative Performance Rating System (OPRS) evaluations. Prompts to complete evaluations were made through a system of automatic electronic notifications. We compared the time spent in the platform to achieve evaluation completion. As a metric for the platform\u27s effect on faculty participation, we considered a task that would typically be infeasible without workflow optimization: the evaluator could choose to complete multiple, complementary evaluations for the same resident in the same case. For those cases with multiple evaluations, correlation was analyzed by Spearman rank test. Evaluation data were compared between PGY levels using repeated measures ANOVA.  SETTING:
The study took place at 4 general surgery residency programs: The University of Massachusetts Medical School-Baystate, the University of Connecticut School or Medicine, the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, and Maimonides Medical Center.  PARTICIPANTS:
From March 2017 to February 2019, the study included 70 surgical teaching faculty and 101 general surgery residents.  RESULTS:
Faculty completed 1230 O-Score evaluations and 106 OPRS evaluations. Evaluations were completed quickly, with a median time of 36 ± 18 seconds for O-Score evaluations, and 53 ± 51 seconds for OPRS evaluations. 89% of O-Score and 55% of OPRS evaluations were completed without optional comments within one minute, and 99% of O-Score and 82% of OPRS evaluations were completed within 2 minutes. For cases eligible for both evaluation types, attendings completed both evaluations on 74 of 221 (33%) of these cases. These paired evaluations strongly correlated on resident performance (Spearman coefficient = 0.84, p \u3c 0.00001). Both evaluation types stratified operative skill level by program year (p \u3c 0.00001).  CONCLUSIONS:
Evaluation initiatives can be hampered by the challenge of making multiple surgical evaluation instruments available when needed for appropriate clinical situations, including specific case types. As a test of the optimized evaluation workflow, and to lay the groundwork for future data-driven design of evaluations, we tested the impact of simultaneously delivering 2 evaluation instruments via a secure web-based education platform. We measured the evaluation completion rates of faculty surgeon evaluators when rating resident operative performance, and how effectively the results of evaluation could be analyzed and compared, taking advantage of a highly integrated management of the evaluative information",data driven architecture

We focus on solving integer programs, and ground our approach in the large neighborhood search (LNS) paradigm, which iteratively chooses a subset of variables to optimize while leaving the remainder fixed. The appeal of LNS is that it can easily use any existing solver as a subroutine, and thus can inherit the benefits of carefully engineered heuristic approaches and their software implementations. We also show that one can learn a good neighborhood selector from training data. Through an extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our LNS framework can significantly outperform, in wall-clock time, compared to state-of-the-art commercial solvers such as Gurobi",data driven architecture

loading. These structures are used widely in aerospace applications and are highly sensitive to geometrical,
material, loading, and boundary imperfections. In fact, the presence of these imperfections can lead to catastrophic failure. In 1968, NASA reported relations for obtaining the Knockdown Factor (KDF) based on an
empirical method that is valid for isotropic and orthotropic materials; however, these relations do not consider
the effect of elastic boundaries that can lead to highly conservative values of KDF. In design practice, a universal KDF of 0.65 has been used for recent designs by NASA, which may not be applicable to new types of structural configuration with different loading and boundary conditions. Therefore, there is a need for robust design
factors for future designs which reduce the dependency on testing during preliminary design phases and speeds
up the product development process. The availability of up‐to‐date and different KDF expressions for different
structural configurations would help engineers to design lighter structures with improved load carrying capacity and reliability. The main objective of this work is to identify the buckling load sensitivity of cylindrical
shells due to their boundary conditions and develop KDF relations considering elastic boundaries. To achieve
this goal, the effect of axial, radial and tangential support stiffness on a quasi‐isotropic cylinder under axial
compression is investigated. A data‐driven design approach is used to develop new KDF empirical relations
for a quasi‐isotropic cylinder on different elastic foundations. The accuracy of these relations is within 5%

Therefore, most applications to the early design phases are passed by as simple overarching ideas informed by the designer and users’ knowledge. Although this is a preferred method of choice making, the knowledge used to inform conceptual and schematic design process can be limited. With the increase of computation in all major industries, a new increase in data to describe forms of infrastructure is required. These forms being objects to analyze their performance and potential, and active forms that can describe the disposition of urban space. Previous research into data driven design has worked its way into standardization and performance goals. However, the connection between active and object forms as a network of standards has yet to be introduced as a method of advising design. Meaning design has focused on creating a single object that seems to benefit the ecology. No attempt at connecting urban active data to object data has been made to benefit both forms equally, but only to preserve the status quo. The introduction of Machine learning algorithms has the capability to connect these complex forms and inform new designs. The application of machine learning algorithms advises the early phases of architectural design process by reviewing a manifold of data, privileging complex analogical connections, and simulating the designers informed symbolic choices.

In the present paper it is attempted to generalize the design optimization methodology into a program synthesis technique for determining the code necessary to encapsulate the constitutive behavior of the material system required for generalized FEA applications. The core concept behind the methodology followed by our group in the past, has been the experimental identification of a dissipated energy density (DED) function for polymer matrix composites (PMCs) through a non-linear optimization scheme for determining the free coefficients of the sum of the basis functions that are used to construct the DED function and is based on the energy balance of the specimen under testing. The utilized testing generated massive amounts of experimental data that would be produced by exposing PMC specimens to multidimensional loading paths with the help of custom made multi-axial computer-controlled testing machines. The variety of custom environments utilized to implement the analytical and numerical details has often created difficulties in transferring our technology to end users in the design and material communities. The present implementation was greatly enabled by recent advances in finite element techniques and &quot;of the shelf&quot; design optimization integration technologies along with the parallel hardware and software evolution. The program synthesis lies on a process that automatically generates the code of a user material subroutine through minimization of the error between measured and simulated specimen behavior.

Currently, the learning science community is exploring the use of data-driven design to improve K12 educational systems. These “continuous-improvement systems” aim to align strategic goals, outcome metrics and human-computer system processes to support improved learning outcomes. However, the learning science community has only begun to apply systemic design to practical implementation of these systems.



In this paper, we present several examples of data-driven design in K12 educational systems in order to identify aspects that can beneﬁt from systemic design. Through these case studies, we focus on three concepts: 1) systemic designers can ensure that the system is capable of measuring successful outcomes; 2) systemic designers can ensure that system optimization will improve intended outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences; and 3) systemic designers can portray what a future with these continuous improvement systems will be like to the educational community, before any resources are committed to building the technology.



Example #1: Ensure that the system is capable of measuring successful outcomes



Data can be used to inform system stakeholders about the success of designed systems; that is, how well outcome measures align with system intentions. For instance, after providing an instructional activity (lecture, small group, video, etc) in class, a teacher might assign their students an “exit ticket” quiz to assess whether the instructional activity was successful. These quizzes support data-driven decisions about how to spend time and effort in the classroom. Variations in student performance give teachers an understanding of the students who need greater attention and the learning objectives that need greater attention. Further, digital data from exit tickets or other formative assessments can be aggregated across teachers to provide school administrators with continuous insight into the areas of need, such as students or teachers who need additional help or learning objectives that are posing special challenges. Providers of digital instruction can then aggregate usage and performance across many schools in order to identify successful and unsuccessful usage patterns. Data-driven continuous improvement can occur at multiple levels (i.e., teacher, school & software provider) when systems are designed to generate valid outcome metrics of success (goal achievement).



Example #2: Ensure that system optimization will improve intended outcomes while minimizing unintended consequence



Success metrics can be used by human teams and AI systems to drive continuous improvement. However, the optimization of metrics can produce unintended consequences when chosen metrics are not fully aligned to intended outcomes and when feedback loops about metric suitability are impoverished. In this case study, an online educational game is designed with the goal of motivating students to practice math problems. After being deployed online, the game attracts several thousand students a day; these players are randomly assigned to different game design variations to observe how



the effects of different designs on key outcome metrics (e.g., duration of voluntary play). To investigate the role of AI in system design optimization, we implemented a UCB multi-armed bandit (a reinforcement learning AL/ML algorithm) to automatically test variations in the existing game parameter space (e.g., time limits, etc). The algorithm is designed to optimally balance the exploration of potential game designs with exploitation of the most successful designs; sometimes it will randomly search the game design space for conﬁgurations that maximize metrics (duration of voluntary play time) and sometimes it will deploy the most successful variations. While the algorithm worked as intended, the system “spun out of control” and primarily deployed malformed game designs that were maximizing the outcome metric but were misaligned with the original educational intent: the game variations were likely played for long periods of time because they were absurdly easy. This shows the pitfalls of having AI systems engage in automatic optimization without humans in the loop as a governing feedback system. Systemic designers need to design feedback systems to monitor system AI to ensure that outputs are meaningfully aligned to system intentions.



Example #3: Portray what the future will be like



Artiﬁcial intelligence has the potential to facilitate the work of teachers by reducing the effort required to use data to inform personalized instruction. However, AI can be intimidating or off-putting to teachers who do not understand its operation or intentions. In this case study, we deployed a teacher-facing recommendation system that uses reinforcement learning to continuously improve recommendation usefulness to teachers. To design a reinforcement learning AI system, there must be data representations of the system state, the space of possible actions and a reward signal tied to a success metric. In our case, the system state is student digital performance on learning activities, the action possibilities are the different digital items that teachers can next assign to a student and the reward signal occurs when teachers act upon a recommendation (i.e., when they assign those digital activities recommended by the system).



This system embodies two key elements that diverge from most existing work in “adaptive learning” or “intelligent tutoring systems.” First, the system emphasizes human-technology teamwork, in contrast to human replacement, so that teachers are empowered by the assistance of the AI. Secondly, the artiﬁcial intelligence is deliberately constructed as an aggregation of human intelligence: the system learns from the activity-assignment decisions that are made by thousands of other human teachers and aggregates them into artiﬁcially intelligent recommendations. To promote adoption of this system, a key role for systemic design is making the intended future vision accessible and attractive to teachers and other stakeholders. Systemic designers can help to engage humans to participate in the decision making by presenting a glimpse of what a data-driven future might be like in the classroom.



Conclusion



Across these case studies, we show how systemic design can aid diverse participants in the implementation of data-driven design and optimization. Systemic design insight can contribute to the negotiation of meaningful and robust metrics of success, to the construction of human-in-the-loop governance of AI systems and to the representation of potential futures. We expect designers to play a crucial role in taming the complexity of practical AI-human systems and aligning system outcomes to sustainable, humanistic values",data driven architecture

What is clarified in this work is how these influence remote collaboration and conversational grounding in particular — where grounding refers to the pro-active process of seeking, creating and maintaining the shared meanings needed for conversational partners to communicate effectively. 



Additionally, this thesis clarifies how to support non-collocated synchronous mediated-collaboration around intelligence analytic tasks — away from traditional tasks that involve the identification or manipulation of physical objects which previous studies appear to favour.



This research is guided by these three primary research questions:



—RQ1) How can we expose aspects of conversational grounding in mediated communication involving different combinations of a video (showing a remote participant’s head and shoulder, and hands and work-area) and a fully shared visual workspace in addition to voice?



—RQ2) In relation to the negotiated process of grounding, how can we explain what is happening when parties are collaborating on an intelligence task using a fully shared visual workspace?



—RQ3) How can we design better fully shared visual workspace systems to support remote collaborative intelligence analysis tasks? 



Study1 — reported in Chapter 5, is an exploratory research which also serves as a groundwork for Study2. The findings there led to the formulation of more focused hypotheses later investigated in Study2. Further, the most significant contribution of the Study1 was the coding schema constructed for analysing the negotiation of common ground.



Chapter 6, 7, 8 make up Study2. A human-participant experiment was conducted using a 2 x 2 factorial between-subjects design with 2-person teams and four media manipulations namely: video, no video, shared visual workspace and no shared visual workspace. Conversational grounding effort is operationalized as the number of repair-episodes per min (that is repair rate). Results here indicate that teams using shared visual workspace have a lower repair rate than those teams with no access to shared visual workspace. This result is statistically significant.



Although teams using video equally had a lower repair rate than those teams not using video, this result was not statistically significant. This is consistent with prior research which found that a video showing a person’s face and shoulders is not terribly important in collaborative context. 



Results of another investigation demonstrate that regardless of the media condition, teams generally have a lower repair rate over time as the task progressed — this result was statistically significantly positive.



Additionally, assessments of a questionnaire item measuring improvements of mutual agreements and shared understanding over time, showed a statistically significantly difference between the shared visual workspace group and the no shared visual workspace group, as was the participant’s rating of the effectiveness of the medium for information sharing.



Results of a qualitative thematic analysis in Chapter 7 helps explain these statistical results and more. A conceptual process model of conversational grounding in shared visual workspace-mediated interaction is presented in Chapter 8.



The model also summarises the research findings. The discourse there offer useful implications and guidelines for moving beyond current theories and models of the negotiation of common ground. Equally, practical design recommendations for the design of shared visual workspaces are also discussed there.



Chapter 9, 10 reviews the research questions and considers how the research that has been presented addresses them, followed by a discussion of the contributions of the thesis, future work and conclusion.



Overall, this thesis delivers the following contributions:



—1) It advances existing knowledge silos and studies on media effects on conversational grounding — one of the ways it achieves that is by delivering a conceptual model framework for understanding conversational grounding processes in real-time remote collaborative intelligence analysis.



—2) It delivers a new coding schema for the analysis of the negotiation of conversational grounding in remote work. 



—3) It offers four data-driven design recommendations for good practical design of shared visual workspace groupware that better support more natural communicative nuances",data driven architecture

DNNs have been used to estimate a time-frequency (T-F) mask in the short-time

cost function as mean-squared error (MSE) is utilized comparing to some
advanced cost such as objective sound quality assessments. However, such a

the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is
satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame
(WFBF) is considered as PRFB. The frequency characteristic of learned WFBF was
in between STFT and the wavelet transform, and its effectiveness was confirmed
by comparison with a standard STFT-based DNN whose input feature is compressed
