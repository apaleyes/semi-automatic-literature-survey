Human beings are already living in these two interacted and fusional worlds. Various of data are not only the kind of valuable resources, but also the new cognitions of methodology from the viewpoint of data. There are too many characteristics and attributions of data we even didn't really know, such as data philosophy, data thinking, data theory, data rules, data assets, data ownership, data protection, data sharing, data application, data method, data architecture, etc. We need to build an open, safety, sharable, ecological data platform to manage all kinds of data and support various applications for the future cyber society. A simple architecture of data-oriented and data ownership-based, constructed of one-body with two-wings for building complex information systems was proposed and it may be suitable for the future ordered cyber data society."

In essence, supporting efficient publish/subscribe requires data-oriented naming, efficient multicast, and in-network caching. Deployment of native IP-based multicast has failed, and overlay-based multicast systems are inherently inefficient. We surmise that scalable and efficient publish/subscribe will require substantial architectural changes, such as moving from endpoint-oriented systems to information-centric architectures.
 In this paper, we propose a novel multicast forwarding fabric, suitable for large-scale topic-based publish/subscribe. Due to very simple forwarding decisions and small forwarding tables, the fabric may be more energy efficient than the currently used ones. To understand the limitations and potential, we provide efficiency and scalability analysis via simulations and early measurements from our two implementations. We show that the system scales up to metropolitan WAN sizes, and we discuss how to interconnect separate networks."

of the 4WARD Networking of Information architecture (NetInf), PARC's Content Centric Networking(CCN), the Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP), and the Data Oriented Network Architecture (DONA). All four projects take an information-centric approach to designing a future network architecture, where the information objects themselves are the primary focus rather than the network nodes."

These challenges stem from the increasing incorporation of distributed renewable energy sources on to the grid, the rising deployment of electric vehicles, and active consumer participation into power grid operations, all of which communicate with the utility control center with varying degrees of priority and security. To address these challenging requirements, we propose SeDAX, a SEcure Data-centric Application eXtensible platform for Smart Grid applications. SeDAX implements scalable, resilient and secure data delivery and data sharing in a wide area network. The platform can scalably handle high volumes of data generated by both applications and sensors. The SeDAX architecture has as its basis a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) network. The properties of the DT graph are leveraged to scalably support secure data-centric (or information-centric) group communication. The primary goals of this platform are to support communication resilience and data availability. The key functional blocks of the SeDAX platform are: (1) a geographic hash forwarding algorithm that operates over the DT graph (DT-GHF), and (2) a DT-based data replication scheme. The forwarding and replication schemes are scalable and cost effective in terms of communication overhead and memory. We describe the design details of the SeDAX platform and present empirical results on the performance of SeDAX as compared with other geometric-based alternatives such as Geographic Hash Table (GHT) forwarding and Content Addressable Networking (CAN). The operation of SeDAX is illustrated in the context of implementing demand response, a known Smart Grid application."

We propose a network architecture called Data-centric Network (DCN) where communication is done using a data identifier (ID) and the dynamic data registered by mobile terminals can be retrieved by specifying the data ID. DCN mitigates the problems of prior arts, which are large size of routing table and transaction load of name resolution service. DCN introduces concept of route attraction and aggregation in which the related routes are attracted to an aggregation point and aggregated to reduce routing table size, and route optimization in which optimized routes are established routes to reduce access transaction load to the aggregation points. These allow the proposed architecture to deal with ever increasing number of data and terminals with frequent mobility and changes in data."

The clean-slate design makes it possible to take into account issues in the current Internet, such as unwanted traffic, from the start. If these new proposals are ever deployed as part of the public Internet as an essential building block of the infrastructure, they must be able to operate in a hostile environment, where a large number of users are assumed to collude against the network and other users. In this paper we present a security design through the network stack for a data-centric pub/sub architecture that achieves availability, information integrity, and allows application-specific security policies while remaining scalable. We analyse the solution and examine the minimal trust assumptions between the stakeholders in the system to guarantee the security properties advertised."

Motivation is the fact that on the one hand we face a shift to the usage of more and more mobile devices but on the other hand most services in the Internet still use a classic client-server-approach. Data is mainly produced at private devices today and put on centralized servers afterwards. This situation reflects the actual reality better: data is shared directly among users without the need of centralized sources. Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share. Shared data becomes a ""public good"" that is not owned by a specific entity but belongs to the community."

This type of energy user is referred to as the “prosumer”. Thus, prosumer management structures are important within energy market. However, prior studies on energy sustainability has paid little attention on prosumer involvement and management. Likewise, the continuous growth of cities has increased data processing complexity. Consequently, processing and analysis of historical, online, and real-time streaming data from energy sensors and metering devices has become a major issue in smart cities. Therefore, this research aims to present an architecture based on big data to improve energy prosumption in smart community districts by applying enterprise architecture approach grounded on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). Accordingly, qualitative methodology is adopted to collect data by employing case study by focus group interview from two energy companies in Norway to preliminarily validate the architecture. Findings from the case studies was demonstrated in ArchiMate modeling language to evaluate the applicability of the architecture. Moreover, findings from this study provides practical scenario that energy service providers can refer to in designing their own energy data platforms. Essentially, the architecture can be utilized as a guide to help municipalities and policy makers in creating approach for energy data analytics in smart community districts towards making decisions for future energy prosumption planning."

Because of using proper and huge amount of data in modeling, implementing of this type of models causes less calculation complexity. Data-oriented architecture is made of considering memory and small calculation unit together. Proposed method calculates Ln function faster than common methods."

Several IoT applications have real-time and low-latency requirements and must rely on architectures specifically designed to manage gigantic streams of information in terms of number of data sources and transmission data rate. We refer to ""Big Stream"" as the paradigm which best fits the selected IoT scenario, in contrast to the traditional ""Big Data"" concept, which does not consider real-time constraints. Moreover, there are many security concerns related to IoT devices and to the Cloud. In this paper, we analyze security aspects in a novel Cloud architecture for Big Stream applications, which efficiently handles Big Stream data through a Graph-based platform and delivers processed data to consumers, with low latency. The authors detail each module defined in the system architecture, describing all refinements required to make the platform able to secure large data streams. An experimentation is also conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture when integrating security mechanisms."
