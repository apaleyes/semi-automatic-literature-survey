In this area, though the high-density multi-GPU architecture enabled unparalleled performance advantage of dense GPUs in a single server, it has increased the difficulty for scheduling diversified and dependent tasks. We therefore propose a data-oriented method for scheduling dependent tasks for this architecture while providing its implementation. In our method, we model a parallel program as a collection of data-dependent tasks for which data dependencies are managed by an expressive matrix. Accordingly, we develop a hierarchical scheduler infrastructure for our model. In this, a top scheduler is built for querying the data-dependency matrix; three downstream schedulers for queuing computation tasks that are exclusively assigned to processor, accelerator or either; and a multitude of bottom schedulers each for providing a processing element with assigned tasks. We experiment our scheduler for examples of Strassen matrix multiplication and Cholesky matrix inversion algorithms on a computer that has 8 Tesla K40 GPUs. The results show that our method is capable of offering the efficient task parallelism while fulfilling the complex task dependencies. When advanced task-oriented schedulers have been widely designed for distributed systems, a lightweight data-driven scheduler could be an alternative and handy approach that can handle the dependent yet diversified tasks of data-intensive applications for the novel high-density multi-accelerator system."

application domains. Strict latency requirements and continuously increasing
graph sizes demand the usage of highly parallel in-memory graph processing
engines that need to consider non-uniform memory access (NUMA) and concurrency
issues to scale up on modern multiprocessor systems. To tackle these aspects,
graph partitioning becomes increasingly important. Hence, we present a
technique to process graph pattern matching on NUMA systems in this paper. As a
scalable pattern matching processing infrastructure, we leverage a
data-oriented architecture that preserves data locality and minimizes
concurrency-related bottlenecks on NUMA systems. We show in detail, how graph
pattern matching can be asynchronously processed on a multiprocessor system."

CCN (Content Centric Networking) [1] is one of the most important proposals for future Internet architecture, which aims to build a content/data oriented network to solve these limitations. On the other hand, HTTP is the most important protocol to deploy new services and applications on current TCP/IP-based Internet. In this paper, we attempt to run HTTP protocol on CCN and combine the two by stitching them semantically on their content-oriented features, such as content caching. We expect that this combination can be leveraged to build CCN testbed with real HTTP traffic which is vital to validation and redesigning of specific mechanisms of CCN and to finding a transition way of CCN in which great incentive is provided for service providers in the economic ecosystem of content distribution. We designed and implemented a HTTP-CCN gateway to transform HTTP request and HTTP response into CCN Interest and Data respectively. We illustrate how to semantically map HTTP caching to CCN caching, which is one of the most attractive properties of CCN. We also discuss how to achieve transparent caching with CCN and find out that it is nontrivial to achieve complete transparency of caching with CCN given no cooperation with CDNs and content providers."

In order to efficiently execute such applications, it is vital that cloud providers change the way hardware infrastructure resources are managed to improve their performance. However, the increasing use of virtualization technologies to achieve an efficient usage of infrastructure resources continuously widens the gap between applications and the underlying hardware, thus decreasing resource efficiency for the end user. Moreover, this scenario is especially troublesome for Big Data applications, as storage resources are one of the most heavily virtualized, thus imposing a significant overhead for large-scale data processing. This paper proposes a novel PaaS architecture specifically oriented for Big Data where the scheduler offers disks as resources alongside the more common CPU and memory resources, looking forward to provide a better storage solution for the user. Furthermore, virtualization overheads are reduced to the bare minimum by replacing heavy hypervisor-based technologies with operating-system-level virtualization based on light software containers. This architecture has been deployed on a Big Data infrastructure at the CESGA supercomputing center, used as a testbed to compare its performance with OpenStack, a popular private cloud platform. Results have shown significant performance improvements, reducing the execution time of representative Big Data workloads by up to 4.5×."

However, in many corporations, this important process is fragmented and is undertaken without a farsighted plan to take advantage of an invaluable resource: data. This can be due to a variety of reasons, for example, lack of funding, poor business vision, inappropriate consulting or deployment. Digital transformation is a considerable investment since it will determine the system’s ability to grow and adapt to the company’s changing requirements. To achieve that end, the architecture must be flexible both in development and deployment and must also be able to harness the ever-increasing data of the corporation. Among the widely used information system architectures being used in the world, Micro-service is a standout with many advantages. The adaptation of this architecture to work with Big Data, as well as to tackle different aspects of a data system such as load-balancing, file handling and storage, etc. is a very practical area of research. This paper presents such an enterprise integration solution for a mega-corporation client in Vietnam, the An Pha Petrol Group Joint Stock Company, including the architecture and technologies used to build a comprehensive system that brings novel experiences to its 2,000 internal users. It consists of building the information infrastructure and system, super applications for both desktop and mobile devices to enhance the work performance and quality.

As the stream processing technology matures and more organizations invest in digital transformations, new applications of stream analytics will be identified and implemented across a wide spectrum of industries. One of the challenges in developing a streaming analytics infrastructure is the difficulty in selecting the right stream processing framework for the different use cases. With a view to addressing this issue, in this paper we present a taxonomy, a comparative study of distributed data stream processing and analytics frameworks, and a critical review of representative open source (Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink, Kafka Streams) and commercial (IBM Streams) distributed data stream processing frameworks. The study also reports our ongoing study on a multilevel streaming analytics architecture that can serve as a guide for organizations and individuals planning to implement a real-time data stream processing and analytics framework."

For this purpose, it is necessary to provide tools that enable their successful implementation. This paper therefore proposes a data-centric, distributed, dynamically scalable reference architecture that integrates cutting-edge technologies being aware of the existence of legacy technology typically present in these environments. In order to make its implementation easier, we have designed a metamodel that collects the description of all the elements involved in a digital platform (data, resources, applications and monitoring metrics) as well as the necessary information to configure, deploy and execute applications on it. Likewise, we provide a tool compliant to the metamodel that automates the generation of configuration, deployment and launch files and their corresponding transference and execution in the nodes of the platform. We show the flexibility, extensibility and validity of our software artefacts through their application in two case studies, one addressed to preprocess and store pollution data and the other one, more complex, which simulates the management of an electric power distribution of a smart city"

Popular architectural styles, including data flow architecture, event driven architecture and service-oriented architecture, can be regarded as special cases, by the appropriate assignment of roles and choice of quality of service in the interfaces between components. Data-oriented application architecture coupled with an appropriate standards based messaging software bus such as DDS can cut down the complexity of the integration problem from O(N*N) to O(N), while preserving loose-coupling and ensuring scalability. Having readily available middleware infrastructure bridges for popular application platform components can greatly boost productivity and the pace of integration."

In other words, the new network architecture designs become in favor of hop-to-hop model, instead of traditional TCP-like end-to-end model. Named data networking is a promising future internet data oriented architecture which uses names instead of addresses and exchanges or forwards interest/data pair packets at each node along the path to route data for delivery. And meanwhile Network coding (NC) is a content oriented and effective method to reduce redundancy, increase network throughput and improve robustness. Nonetheless, due to NDN's current preliminary research, less research has combined these two technologies together. This paper presents some new thoughts to study on the benefits brought by integrating network coding to NDN, which can effectively improve network utilization, strengthen caching privacy, and also promote development of the NDN architecture itself."

This new architecture brings both new problems to be solved and also natural solutions to existing problems. This paper investigates an intra-domain traffic engineering (TE) problem for an information-centric networking (ICN) architecture where a form of source routing is used as the forwarding mechanism. The TE goal is to maximise the residual capacity in the network so that the load is spread evenly. A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks. Allowing splittable flows means that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme can be used that has superior results when compared to existing constraint based routing schemes for flows that cannot be split. Consequently, this work demonstrates that the ICN architecture can simplify the given TE problem in a natural manner."

These innovations are fueled by a desire to support complex and data-rich web applications while consuming minimal resources. One of the chief advancements has been the emergence of the asynchronous web server architecture, which is built from the ground up for scalability. While this architecture can offer a significant boost in performance over classic forking servers, it does so at the cost of abandoning memory space isolation between client interactions. This shift in design, that delegates the handling of many unrelated requests within the same process, enables powerful and covert data-oriented attacks that rival complete web server takeover — without ever hijacking the control flow of the server application. To demonstrate the severity of this threat, we present a technique for identifying security-critical web server data by tracing memory accesses committed by the program in generating responses to client requests. We further develop a framework for performing live memory analysis of a running server in order to understand how low-level memory structures can be corrupted for malicious intent. A fundamental goal of our work is to assess the realism of such data-oriented attacks in terms of the types of memory errors that can be leveraged to perform them, and to understand the prominence of these errors in real-world web servers. Our case study on a leading asynchronous architecture, namely Nginx, shows how dataoriented attacks allow an adversary to re-configure an Nginx instance on the fly in order to degrade or disable services (e.g., error reporting, security headers like HSTS, access control), steal sensitive information, as well as distribute arbitrary web content to unsuspecting clients — all by manipulating only a few bytes in memory. Our empirical findings on the susceptibility of modern asynchronous web servers to two wellknown CVEs show that the damage could be severe. To address this threat, we also discuss several potential mitigations. Taken as a whole, our work tells a cautionary tale regarding the risks of blindly pushing forward with performance optimizations."

A data‐driven IoT software platform is essential for realizing manageable and sustainable smart utilities and for novel applications to be developed upon them. Here, we propose such service‐oriented software architecture to address 2 key operational activities in a smart utility: the IoT fabric for resource management and the data and application platform for decision‐making. Our design uses Open Web standards and evolving network protocols, cloud and edge resources, and streaming big data platforms. We motivate our design requirements using the smart water management domain; some of these requirements are unique to developing nations. We also validate the architecture within a campus‐scale IoT testbed at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and present our experiences.

The requirements in flexibility, efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility of the intermodule communication between the connected machines raise challenges for the M2M messaging mechanism toward ubiquitous data access and events notification. This investigation determines the challenges facing the M2M communication of industrial systems and presents a data-oriented M2M messaging mechanism based on ZeroMQ for the ubiquitous data access in rich sensing pervasive industrial applications. To prove the feasibility of the proposed solution, the EU funded PickNPack production line with a reference industrial network architecture is presented, and the communication between a microwave sensor device and the quality assessment and sensing module controller of the PickNPack line is illustrated as a case study. The evaluation is carried out through qualitative analysis and experimental studies, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed messaging mechanism. Due to the flexibility in dealing with hierarchical system architecture and cross-platform heterogeneity of industrial applications, this messaging mechanism deserves extensive investigations and further evaluations."

DOSA combines data with ownership by using digital certification authentication (CA) and public key infrastructure (PKI). The DOSA is simply described as one body with two wings. The one body is that the data must be combined with ownership. The one wing is that the data should be innately registered. Another wing is that the data should be innately encrypted with the data owner's public key. To share data and make data applicable, DOSA also establishes the authorization of data ownership for data sharing, the recording of data operation for data history tracing, the data behaviour analysis for the discovery of illegal use of data, and the data usage statistics for the assessment of data value, etc. Therefore, data can be securely shared and used in an open environment with ownership authorization. At the same time, data ownership is clarified; the interests of the data owner can be guaranteed."

to explosion of data in every field of operations. Working with the enormous
volume of data (or Big Data, as it is popularly known as) for extraction of

competitive advantage for organizations today. Enterprises are leveraging the
power of analytics in formulating business strategy in every facet of their
operations to mitigate business risk. Volatile global market scenario has
compelled the organizations to redefine their supply chain management (SCM). In
this paper, we have delineated the relevance of Big Data and its importance in
managing end to end supply chains for achieving business excellence. A Big
Data-centric architecture for SCM has been proposed that exploits the current
state of the art technology of data management, analytics and visualization.

Big data systems are mainstream and the demand for building systems that able to process data streams is growing. Yet many decision support systems act like ”black boxes”, providing little or no transparency in the rationale of their processes [1]. The ”black box” methodologies are not acceptable in crucial domains like health care, aviation, and maintenance. Experts prefer to reason the decisions. Current big data strategies tend to process in-motion data and o↵er many potential scenarios to work with. The big data term refers to dynamic, large, structured and unstructured volumes of data generated from di↵erent sources with di↵erent formats [2]. Therefore, it is a must for CBR systems that tends to process the in-motion data to manage their sub-tasks, such as collecting and formatting data, case base maintenance, cases retrieval, cases adaptation and retaining new cases [3]. In my research I will describe the idea of spanning the gap between CBR and Big Data based on the SEASALT architecture [4] [5]. SEASALT is an application independent architecture to work with heterogeneous data repositories and modularizing knowledge. It was proposed based on the CoMES approach to develop collaborative multi-expert systems and provides an application-independent architecture that features knowledge acquisition from a Web community, knowledge modularization, and agent-based knowledge maintenance. Its first research prototype was developed for the travel medicine application [4]. SEASALT aims to provide a coherent multi-agent CBR architecture that can define the outlines and interactions to develop multi-agent CBR systems."

In contrast to process-oriented or transaction-oriented system designs, dataoriented architectures are based on data locality and function shipping. The tight coupling of data and processing thereon is implemented in different systems in a variety of application scenarios such as data analysis, database-as-a-service, and data management on multiprocessor systems. Data-oriented systems, i.e., systems that implement a data-oriented architecture, bundle data and operations together in tasks which are processed locally on the nodes of the distributed system. Allocation strategies, i.e., methods that decide the mapping from tasks to nodes, are core components in data-oriented systems. Good allocation strategies can lead to balanced systems while bad allocation strategies cause skew in the load and therefore suboptimal application performance and infrastructure utilization. Optimal allocation strategies are hard to find given the complexity of the systems, the complicated interactions of tasks, and the huge solution space. To ensure the scalability of dataoriented systems and to keep them manageable with hundreds of thousands of tasks, thousands of nodes, and dynamic workloads, fast and reliable allocation strategies are mandatory. In this thesis, we develop novel allocation strategies for data-oriented systems based on graph partitioning algorithms. Therefore, we show that systems from different application scenarios with different abstraction levels can be generalized to generic infrastructure and workload descriptions. We use weighted graph representations to model infrastructures with bounded and unbounded, i.e., overcommited, resources and possibly non-linear performance characteristics. Based on our generalized infrastructure and workload model, we formalize the allocation problem, which seeks valid and balanced allocations that minimize communication. Our allocation strategies partition the workload graph using solution heuristics that work with single and multiple vertex weights. Novel extensions to these solution heuristics can be used to balance penalized and secondary graph partition weights. These extensions enable the allocation strategies to handle infrastructures with non-linear performance behavior. On top of the basic algorithms, we propose methods to incorporate heterogeneous infrastructures and to react to changing workloads and infrastructures by incrementally updating the partitioning. We evaluate all components of our allocation strategy algorithms and show their applicability and scalability with synthetic workload graphs. In end-to-end– performance experiments in two actual data-oriented systems, a database-as-aservice system and a database management system for multiprocessor systems, we prove that our allocation strategies outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods."

The conceptual model of presented method as data-oriented architecture is designed to implement it with hardware. This method is able to determine the exact place of one and two bits in error and correct them. In a way, nonzero calculated remainder on receiver is compared with remainder field of the content of Problem Solution Data Structure, PSDS, to find the error location, as a solution."

In addition, in Vietnam, a shortage of specialized equipment and qualified professionals is becoming a significant problem for not only accurate diagnosis but also timely and effective treatment of stroke, especially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an acute case of stroke. This research will analyze challenges and show solutions for constructing an effective knowledge system in ICH diagnosis and treatment that helps to shorten professional gap among hospitals and regions. We suggest a service-oriented architecture for the big data driven knowledge system based on medical imaging of ICH. The architecture ensures the development of knowledge obeying a systematic and complete process including the exploration and exploitation of knowledge from medical imaging. Besides, the architecture adapts to modern trends in knowledge service modeling."

Motivation is the fact that on the one hand we face a shift to the usage of more and more mobile devices but on the other hand most services in the Internet still use a classic client-server-approach. Data is mainly produced at private devices today and put on centralized servers afterwards. This situation reflects the actual reality better: data is shared directly among users without the need of centralized sources. Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share. Shared data becomes a ""public good"" that is not owned by a specific entity but belongs to the community."

A taxonomy for dataflow and metaflow is proposed for better understanding of the architecture. In addition, a metadata schema is built within the framework of the seven components. The architecture with its metadata component is applied to a real-life data warehouse for a large medical center in order to illustrate its practical usefulness."

In essence, supporting efficient publish/subscribe requires data-oriented naming, efficient multicast, and in-network caching. Deployment of native IP-based multicast has failed, and overlay-based multicast systems are inherently inefficient. We surmise that scalable and efficient publish/subscribe will require substantial architectural changes, such as moving from endpoint-oriented systems to information-centric architectures.
 In this paper, we propose a novel multicast forwarding fabric, suitable for large-scale topic-based publish/subscribe. Due to very simple forwarding decisions and small forwarding tables, the fabric may be more energy efficient than the currently used ones. To understand the limitations and potential, we provide efficiency and scalability analysis via simulations and early measurements from our two implementations. We show that the system scales up to metropolitan WAN sizes, and we discuss how to interconnect separate networks."

These challenges stem from the increasing incorporation of distributed renewable energy sources on to the grid, the rising deployment of electric vehicles, and active consumer participation into power grid operations, all of which communicate with the utility control center with varying degrees of priority and security. To address these challenging requirements, we propose SeDAX, a SEcure Data-centric Application eXtensible platform for Smart Grid applications. SeDAX implements scalable, resilient and secure data delivery and data sharing in a wide area network. The platform can scalably handle high volumes of data generated by both applications and sensors. The SeDAX architecture has as its basis a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) network. The properties of the DT graph are leveraged to scalably support secure data-centric (or information-centric) group communication. The primary goals of this platform are to support communication resilience and data availability. The key functional blocks of the SeDAX platform are: (1) a geographic hash forwarding algorithm that operates over the DT graph (DT-GHF), and (2) a DT-based data replication scheme. The forwarding and replication schemes are scalable and cost effective in terms of communication overhead and memory. We describe the design details of the SeDAX platform and present empirical results on the performance of SeDAX as compared with other geometric-based alternatives such as Geographic Hash Table (GHT) forwarding and Content Addressable Networking (CAN). The operation of SeDAX is illustrated in the context of implementing demand response, a known Smart Grid application."

We propose a network architecture called Data-centric Network (DCN) where communication is done using a data identifier (ID) and the dynamic data registered by mobile terminals can be retrieved by specifying the data ID. DCN mitigates the problems of prior arts, which are large size of routing table and transaction load of name resolution service. DCN introduces concept of route attraction and aggregation in which the related routes are attracted to an aggregation point and aggregated to reduce routing table size, and route optimization in which optimized routes are established routes to reduce access transaction load to the aggregation points. These allow the proposed architecture to deal with ever increasing number of data and terminals with frequent mobility and changes in data."

This type of energy user is referred to as the “prosumer”. Thus, prosumer management structures are important within energy market. However, prior studies on energy sustainability has paid little attention on prosumer involvement and management. Likewise, the continuous growth of cities has increased data processing complexity. Consequently, processing and analysis of historical, online, and real-time streaming data from energy sensors and metering devices has become a major issue in smart cities. Therefore, this research aims to present an architecture based on big data to improve energy prosumption in smart community districts by applying enterprise architecture approach grounded on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). Accordingly, qualitative methodology is adopted to collect data by employing case study by focus group interview from two energy companies in Norway to preliminarily validate the architecture. Findings from the case studies was demonstrated in ArchiMate modeling language to evaluate the applicability of the architecture. Moreover, findings from this study provides practical scenario that energy service providers can refer to in designing their own energy data platforms. Essentially, the architecture can be utilized as a guide to help municipalities and policy makers in creating approach for energy data analytics in smart community districts towards making decisions for future energy prosumption planning."
