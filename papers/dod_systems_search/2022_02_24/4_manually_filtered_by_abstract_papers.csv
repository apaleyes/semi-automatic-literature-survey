Abstract Rapid advances in wireless and mobile communications and computing technologies have enabled handy personal mobile devices to be used in everyday life. Such small mobile devices can now become not only information browsers and service clients, but also information and service providers, complementing or replacing fixed hosts connected to the wireline network. Such mobile resources can be very important for other moving users and mobile devices, creating significant opportunities for many interesting and novel applications. The MobiShare architecture outlined in this paper provides a scalable infrastructure for ubiquitous mobile access to dynamic information and mechanisms for publishing, discovering and accessing heterogeneous mobile resources in a large area, taking into account the context of both providers and requestors. Any wireless communication technology could be employed between a device and the system. In addition, the use of XML-related languages and protocols for describing and exchanging metadata gives the system a uniform, easily adaptable and platform-independent interface, allowing a variety of devices to use it. The overall approach is data-centric and service-oriented, implying that all the devices are treated both as potential providers or requestors of data wrapped as information m-services.",excluded

Adoption of a data-centric communication mechanism can enable in-network aggregation and processing which help make data forwarding more efficient. In this paper, we briefly describe ASCoT, a routing system for science missions of tomorrow, which a) leverages the predictability of satellite trajectories to effect position-based routing in the space backbone, and b) departs from traditional address-centric communication and uses a data-centric architecture to enable energy efficient and low latency operation in proximity networks.

In this work we use a data-centric architecture for opportunistic networks to evaluate data dis-semination overhead, congestion in nodes ’ buffer, and the impact of transfer ordering. Dissemination brings an overhead since data is replicated to be spread in the network and overhead leads to congestion, i.e., overloaded buffers. We develop and implement an emulation testbed to experimentally eval-uate properties of opportunistic networks. We evaluate the repeatability of experiments in the emulated testbed that is based on virtual computers. We show that the timing variations are on the order of milliseconds. The testbed was used to investigate overhead in data dissemination, congestion avoidance, and transfer ordering in opportunistic networks. We show that the overhead can be reduced by informing other nodes in the network about what data a node is carrying. Congestion avoidance was evaluated in terms of buffer management, since that is the available tool in an opportunistic network, to handle congestion. It was shown that replication information of data objects in the buffer yields the best results.

This work therefore investigates the resource management problem in sensing services, with application in audio sensing. First, a modular, data-centric architecture is proposed as the framework within which optimal resource management is studied. Next, the guided-processing principle is proposed to achieve optimized trade-off between resource (energy) and (inference) performance.

On cascade-based systems, empirical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the detection performance (up to 1.7x and 4x reduction in false-alarm and miss rate, respectively) for the same energy consumption, when compared to the duty-cycling approach. Furthermore, the guided-processing approach is also generalizable to graph-based systems. Resource-efficiency in the multiple-application setting is achieved through the feature-sharing principle. Once applied, the method results in a system that can achieve 9x resource saving and 1.43x improvement in detection performance in an example application.

Based on the encouraging results above, a prototype audio sensing service is built for demonstration. An interference-robust audio classification technique with limited training data would prove valuable within the service, so a novel algorithm with the desired properties is proposed. The technique combines AI-gram time-frequency representation and multidimensional dynamic time warping, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art using the prominent-region-based approach across a wide range of (synthetic, both stationary and transient) interference types and signal-to-interference ratios, and also on field recordings (with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves being 91% and 87%, respectively)",excluded

A novel concept of smart, connected, open architecture product is hence introduced with a generic cyber-physical model established in a cloud-based environment, of which the interaction processes are enabled by co-development toolkits with smartness and connectedness. Both the personalized SCP modelling method and the establishment of its cyber-physical product model are described in details. To further demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study of a smart wearable device (i.e. i-BRE respiratory mask) development process is given with general discussions.",excluded

Given the unpredictable, dynamic and on-demand nature of the cloud, it would be unrealistic to assume that optimal QoS can be achieved at design time. As a result, there is an increasing need for dynamic and self- adaptive QoS optimization solutions to respond to dynamic changes in SLA and the environment. In this context, we posit that the challenge of self-adaptive QoS optimization encompasses two dynamics, which are related to QoS sensitivity and conflicting objectives at runtime. We propose novel design of a dynamic data-driven architecture for optimizing QoS influenced by those dynamics.

The wireless sensors that constitute the WSN measure physical attributes of the environment they are deployed in such as temperature, pressure, vibration, toxic chemical, biological agents, etc. In our architecture, we assume that the entire WSN can be divided into sets of 'sensor-clusters'. Each cluster has a gateway or base station that aggregates data from its sensor cluster. The gateways themselves which constitute the middleware layer between the WSN and end point clients are designed to form an IP-based distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network. Clients query the gateways for real-time sensor data via a publish/subscribe/notify paradigm implemented at the gateways, and they can also concurrently receive notifications on alarms/events of interest. Another contribution we report in this paper is a Pipelined Time- division Model (PTM) scheduling for continuous energy-aware MAC-layer communication between a gateway and its sensors.

If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. Abstract As more devices and systems get woven into the fabric of our networked world, the scale and the complexity of integration is growing at a rapid pace. Our existing methodologies and training for system software design, rooted in principles of object-oriented design, that worked superbly for small scale systems begin to break down as we discover operational limits which requires frequent and unintended redesigns in programs year over year. Fundamentally, object-oriented thinking leads us to think in terms of tightly-coupled interactions that include strong state assumptions. Large scale distributed systems are often a mix of subsystems created by independent parties, often using different middleware technologies, with misaligned interfaces. Integrating such subsystems using object-oriented thinking poses some fundamental challenges: (1) it is brittle to incremental and independent development, where interfaces can change without notice; (2) there is often an ""impedance mis-match"" between subsystems in the quantity and the quality of information that must be exchanged between the two sides; (3) there is a real need to dynamically adapt in real-time to network topology reconfigurations and failures; (4) scalability, performance, and up-time cannot always be compromised in this dynamic environment. A different paradigm is needed in order to address these new challenges in a systematic manner. As the scale of the integration and complexity grows, the only unifying common denominators between disparate subsystems (generally numbering more than two) are: (1) the data they produce and consume; (2) the services they use and offer. In order to scale, system software architecture must be organized around a common ""shared information model"" that spans multiple systems. This leads us to the principle of ""data-oriented"" design: expose the data and hide the code. In this paper, we will discuss the principles of data-oriented thinking, and discuss why it offers an appropriate paradigm to address large scale system integration. We discuss the critical role played by the middleware infrastructure in applying data-oriented design, and describe a generic data-oriented integration architecture based on the data distribution service (DDS) middleware standard. We analyze popular architectural styles including data flow architecture, event driven architecture, and service oriented architecture from this perspective and establish that they can be viewed as specializations of the generic data-oriented architecture.

Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share. Shared data becomes a ""public good"" that is not owned by a specific entity but belongs to the community.",architecture

These innovations are fueled by a desire to support complex and data-rich web applications while consuming minimal resources. One of the chief advancements has been the emergence of the asynchronous web server architecture, which is built from the ground up for scalability. While this architecture can offer a significant boost in performance over classic forking servers, it does so at the cost of abandoning memory space isolation between client interactions. This shift in design, that delegates the handling of many unrelated requests within the same process, enables powerful and covert data-oriented attacks that rival complete web server takeover — without ever hijacking the control flow of the server application. To demonstrate the severity of this threat, we present a technique for identifying security-critical web server data by tracing memory accesses committed by the program in generating responses to client requests. We further develop a framework for performing live memory analysis of a running server in order to understand how low-level memory structures can be corrupted for malicious intent. A fundamental goal of our work is to assess the realism of such data-oriented attacks in terms of the types of memory errors that can be leveraged to perform them, and to understand the prominence of these errors in real-world web servers. Our case study on a leading asynchronous architecture, namely Nginx, shows how dataoriented attacks allow an adversary to re-configure an Nginx instance on the fly in order to degrade or disable services (e.g., error reporting, security headers like HSTS, access control), steal sensitive information, as well as distribute arbitrary web content to unsuspecting clients — all by manipulating only a few bytes in memory. Our empirical findings on the susceptibility of modern asynchronous web servers to two wellknown CVEs show that the damage could be severe. To address this threat, we also discuss several potential mitigations. Taken as a whole, our work tells a cautionary tale regarding the risks of blindly pushing forward with performance optimizations.",architecture

In order to efficiently execute such applications, it is vital that cloud providers change the way hardware infrastructure resources are managed to improve their performance. However, the increasing use of virtualization technologies to achieve an efficient usage of infrastructure resources continuously widens the gap between applications and the underlying hardware, thus decreasing resource efficiency for the end user. Moreover, this scenario is especially troublesome for Big Data applications, as storage resources are one of the most heavily virtualized, thus imposing a significant overhead for large-scale data processing. This paper proposes a novel PaaS architecture specifically oriented for Big Data where the scheduler offers disks as resources alongside the more common CPU and memory resources, looking forward to provide a better storage solution for the user. Furthermore, virtualization overheads are reduced to the bare minimum by replacing heavy hypervisor-based technologies with operating-system-level virtualization based on light software containers.

The TE goal is to maximise the residual capacity in the network so that the load is spread evenly. A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks. Allowing splittable flows means that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme can be used that has superior results when compared to existing constraint based routing schemes for flows that cannot be split.

However, such technologies require software architectures not only to adapt to the changes and achieve dynamic evolution but also to be reliable. Most of the architecture description techniques are not able to directly capture the dynamic changes in the definition of the software architecture and cannot analyze or evaluate the system reliability. In this paper, we provide a breeze graph grammar (BGG) to model the software architecture in both static and dynamic aspects and give a BGG reliability model to help supporting software system reliability modeling and evaluation. Our work expands this idea in three directions. We first present the definition of BGG to specify the software architecture and map the system dynamic evolution to BGG transformation rules. Second, a BGG reliability model is proposed in which we add error attributes to the BGG graph for capturing the system error information, and the system error state transition is performed through BGG graph rewriting rules. Then, we study the rules to map the BGG reliability model to a generalized stochastic Petri net (GSPN) model, which can be used for reliability evaluation. Throughout this paper, we use a big data‐based centralized system to demonstrate our approach. The BGG graph rewriting characteristic supports the dynamic change requirements, and the architecture is statically checked through the BGG productions. Moreover, system reliability modeling and evaluation can be achieved through the BGG reliability model by combining GSPN. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",excluded

In contrast to process-oriented or transaction-oriented system designs, dataoriented architectures are based on data locality and function shipping. The tight coupling of data and processing thereon is implemented in different systems in a variety of application scenarios such as data analysis, database-as-a-service, and data management on multiprocessor systems. Data-oriented systems, i.e., systems that implement a data-oriented architecture, bundle data and operations together in tasks which are processed locally on the nodes of the distributed system. Allocation strategies, i.e., methods that decide the mapping from tasks to nodes, are core components in data-oriented systems. Good allocation strategies can lead to balanced systems while bad allocation strategies cause skew in the load and therefore suboptimal application performance and infrastructure utilization. Optimal allocation strategies are hard to find given the complexity of the systems, the complicated interactions of tasks, and the huge solution space. To ensure the scalability of dataoriented systems and to keep them manageable with hundreds of thousands of tasks, thousands of nodes, and dynamic workloads, fast and reliable allocation strategies are mandatory. In this thesis, we develop novel allocation strategies for data-oriented systems based on graph partitioning algorithms. Therefore, we show that systems from different application scenarios with different abstraction levels can be generalized to generic infrastructure and workload descriptions. We use weighted graph representations to model infrastructures with bounded and unbounded, i.e., overcommited, resources and possibly non-linear performance characteristics. Based on our generalized infrastructure and workload model, we formalize the allocation problem, which seeks valid and balanced allocations that minimize communication. Our allocation strategies partition the workload graph using solution heuristics that work with single and multiple vertex weights. Novel extensions to these solution heuristics can be used to balance penalized and secondary graph partition weights. These extensions enable the allocation strategies to handle infrastructures with non-linear performance behavior. On top of the basic algorithms, we propose methods to incorporate heterogeneous infrastructures and to react to changing workloads and infrastructures by incrementally updating the partitioning. We evaluate all components of our allocation strategy algorithms and show their applicability and scalability with synthetic workload graphs. In end-to-end– performance experiments in two actual data-oriented systems, a database-as-aservice system and a database management system for multiprocessor systems, we prove that our allocation strategies outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods.",architecture

If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. Abstract As more devices and systems get woven into the fabric of our networked world, the scale and the complexity of integration is growing at a rapid pace. Our existing methodologies and training for system software design, rooted in principles of object-oriented design, that worked superbly for small scale systems begin to break down as we discover operational limits which requires frequent and unintended redesigns in programs year over year. Fundamentally, object-oriented thinking leads us to think in terms of tightly-coupled interactions that include strong state assumptions. Large scale distributed systems are often a mix of subsystems created by independent parties, often using different middleware technologies, with misaligned interfaces. Integrating such subsystems using object-oriented thinking poses some fundamental challenges: (1) it is brittle to incremental and independent development, where interfaces can change without notice; (2) there is often an ""impedance mis-match"" between subsystems in the quantity and the quality of information that must be exchanged between the two sides; (3) there is a real need to dynamically adapt in real-time to network topology reconfigurations and failures; (4) scalability, performance, and up-time cannot always be compromised in this dynamic environment. A different paradigm is needed in order to address these new challenges in a systematic manner. As the scale of the integration and complexity grows, the only unifying common denominators between disparate subsystems (generally numbering more than two) are: (1) the data they produce and consume; (2) the services they use and offer. In order to scale, system software architecture must be organized around a common ""shared information model"" that spans multiple systems. This leads us to the principle of ""data-oriented"" design: expose the data and hide the code. In this paper, we will discuss the principles of data-oriented thinking, and discuss why it offers an appropriate paradigm to address large scale system integration. We discuss the critical role played by the middleware infrastructure in applying data-oriented design, and describe a generic data-oriented integration architecture based on the data distribution service (DDS) middleware standard. We analyze popular architectural styles including data flow architecture, event driven architecture, and service oriented architecture from this perspective and establish that they can be viewed as specializations of the generic data-oriented architecture.

This investigation determines the challenges facing the M2M communication of industrial systems and presents a data-oriented M2M messaging mechanism based on ZeroMQ for the ubiquitous data access in rich sensing pervasive industrial applications. To prove the feasibility of the proposed solution, the EU funded PickNPack production line with a reference industrial network architecture is presented, and the communication between a microwave sensor device and the quality assessment and sensing module controller of the PickNPack line is illustrated as a case study. The evaluation is carried out through qualitative analysis and experimental studies, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed messaging mechanism. Due to the flexibility in dealing with hierarchical system architecture and cross-platform heterogeneity of industrial applications, this messaging mechanism deserves extensive investigations and further evaluations.",architecture

Exp.,semantic_scholar,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b727a990d5a408542afe1bba8bbaca8a53b0fc5f,data oriented architecture,1/1/2018,,,,,towards a data‐driven iot software architecture for smart city utilities,"The Internet of things (IoT) is emerging as the next big wave of digital presence for billions of devices on the Internet. Smart cities are a practical manifestation of IoT, with the goal of efficient, reliable, and safe delivery of city utilities like water, power, and transport to residents, through their intelligent management. A data‐driven IoT software platform is essential for realizing manageable and sustainable smart utilities and for novel applications to be developed upon them. Here, we propose such service‐oriented software architecture to address 2 key operational activities in a smart utility: the IoT fabric for resource management and the data and application platform for decision‐making. Our design uses Open Web standards and evolving network protocols, cloud and edge resources, and streaming big data platforms. We motivate our design requirements using the smart water management domain; some of these requirements are unique to developing nations. We also validate the architecture within a campus‐scale IoT testbed at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and present our experiences. Our architecture is scalable to a township or city while also generalizable to other smart utility domains. Our experiences serve as a template for other similar efforts, particularly in emerging markets and highlight the gaps and opportunities for a data‐driven IoT software architecture for smart cities.",architecture
