This article addresses today's challenges with a solution based on adopting a data-oriented architecture and relying on a standards-based, integrated high-performance middleware platform with standards-based programmable components. Key to the solution is integrating around the system information model instead of the application or technology infrastructure. A standards-based middleware infrastructure that breaks away from traditional assumptions is at the core of this approach. The article also presents successful applications of data-oriented architecture using standards-based middleware.International Foundation for TelemeteringProceedings from the International Telemetering Conference are made available by the International Foundation for Telemetering and the University of Arizona Libraries.

Given a set of examples (spelling words with their associated phonetic representation) in a language, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system is automatically produced for that language which takes as its input the spelling of words, and produces as its output the phonetic transcription according to the rules implicit in the training data. This paper describes the architecture and focuses on our solution to the alignment problem: given the spelling and the phonetic trancription of a word (often differing in length), these two representations have to be aligned in such a way that grapheme symbols or strings of grapheme symbols are consistently associated with the same phonetic symbol. If this alignment has to be done by hand, it is extremely labour-intensive. 1 Introduction  Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is an essential module in any text-to-speech system.

490710719,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Research on data-driven bearing fault diagnosis techniques has recently drawn more and more attention due to the availability of massive condition monitoring data. The research work presented in this paper aims to develop an architecture for the detection and diagnosis of bearing faults in the induction machines. The developed data-oriented architecture uses vibration signals collected by sensors placed on the machine, which is based, in the first place, on the extraction of fault indicators based on the harmonics-to-noise ratio envelope. Normalisation is then applied to the extracted indicators to create a well-processed data set. The evolution of these indicators will be studied afterwards according to the type and severity of defects using sequential backward selection technique. Supervised machine learning classification methods are developed to classify the measurements described by the feature vector with respect to the known modes of operation. In the last phase concerning decision making, ten classifiers are tested and applied based on the selected and combined indicators. The developed classification methods allow classifying the observations, with respect to the different modes of bearing condition (outer race, inner race fault or healthy condition). The proposed method is validated on data collected using an experimental bearing test bench. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy in bearing fault detection under all operational conditions. The results show that, compared to some proposed approaches, our proposed architecture can achieve better performance overall in terms of the number of optimal features and the accuracy of the tests","[{'title': 'Advances in Electrical and Electronic Engineering', 'identifiers': ['1336-1376', 'issn:1336-1376', '1804-3119', 'issn:1804-3119']}]","'VSB Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences'",Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Based on HNR Envelope and Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms,https://core.ac.uk/download/490710719.pdf,10.15598/aeee.v19i4.4183,core
479632286,2021-07-01T00:00:00,"For connected vehicles, as well as generally for the transportation sector, data are now seen as a precious resource. They can be used to make right decisions, improve road safety, reduce CO2 emissions, or optimize processes. However, analyzing these data is not so much a question of which technologies to use, but rather about where these data are analyzed. Thereby, the emerging vehicle architecture has to become a data-oriented architecture based on embedded computing platforms and take into account new applications, artificial intelligence elements, advanced analytics, and operating systems. Accordingly, in this paper, we introduce the concept of data management to the vehicle by proposing an on-board data management layer, so that the vehicle can play the role of data platform capable of storing, processing, and diffusing data. Our proposed layer supports analytics and data science to deliver additional value from the connected vehicle data and stimulate the development of new services. In addition, our data platform can also form or contribute to shaping the backbone of data-driven transport. An on-board platform was built where the dataset size was reduced 80% and a rate of 99% accuracy was achieved in a 5 min traffic flow prediction using artificial neural networks (ANNs)","[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",'MDPI AG',On-Board Data Management Layer: Connected Vehicle as Data Platform,,10.3390/electronics10151810,core

83869216,2017-06-14T00:00:00,"Pattern matching on large graphs is the foundation for a variety of
application domains. Strict latency requirements and continuously increasing
graph sizes demand the usage of highly parallel in-memory graph processing
engines that need to consider non-uniform memory access (NUMA) and concurrency
issues to scale up on modern multiprocessor systems. To tackle these aspects,
graph partitioning becomes increasingly important. Hence, we present a
technique to process graph pattern matching on NUMA systems in this paper. As a
scalable pattern matching processing infrastructure, we leverage a
data-oriented architecture that preserves data locality and minimizes
concurrency-related bottlenecks on NUMA systems. We show in detail, how graph
pattern matching can be asynchronously processed on a multiprocessor system.Comment: 14 Pages, Extended version for ADBIS 201",,,Asynchronous Graph Pattern Matching on Multiprocessor Systems,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03968,10.1007/978-3-319-67162-8_6,core
25891745,2013-11-01T00:00:00Z,"Regarding the importance of statistics and doing statistical calculations by computer, it is necessary to find the ways in accordance with advanced and new computer sciences for calculation. In this research, architecture is presented using data-oriented approach to optimize number distribution and usage of memory and expedite the computing of generating random numbers. To achieve these goals, generating random numbers has been modeled uniformly using data-oriented approach. Data-oriented approach is an approach that models the concepts as data structures and required results can be achieved through data processing and using a special memory instead of excessive calculations. In this paper, to generate uniform random numbers using data-oriented approach, non-precise stack machine structure (ADRNG) was used for modeling. Its advantage over previous approach, which was modeling with tree, is to prevent excessive use of data and to save memory and to prevent necessary time for managing excessive data. Finally, a new data-oriented architecture is presented using this model. Results from generating uniform random numbers through new approach in MATLAB stimulated environment and by calculating standard deviation and dispersion and comparing this with previous approach shows the optimization of generating uniform random numbers","[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['2345-3397', 'issn:2345-3397']}]",International Journal of Computer Science and Network Solutions,Optimizing Data-Oriented Architecture for Generating Random Numbers Uniform with Stack Machines Indeterminate Structure,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25891745.pdf,,core
