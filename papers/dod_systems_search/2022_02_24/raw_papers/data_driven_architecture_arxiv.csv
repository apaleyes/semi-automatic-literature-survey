  Diversity-Based Active Learning","Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in diverse domains,
data-driven metamaterials design has emerged as a compelling design paradigm to
unlock the potential of multiscale architecture. However, existing
model-centric approaches lack principled methodologies dedicated to
high-quality data generation. Resorting to space-filling design in shape
descriptor space, existing metamaterial datasets suffer from property
distributions that are either highly imbalanced or at odds with design tasks of
interest. To this end, we propose t-METASET: an intelligent data acquisition
framework for task-aware dataset generation. We seek a solution to a
commonplace yet frequently overlooked scenario at early design stages: when a
massive ($~\sim O(10^4)$) shape library has been prepared with no properties
evaluated. The key idea is to exploit a data-driven shape descriptor learned
from generative models, fit a sparse regressor as the start-up agent, and
leverage diversity-related metrics to drive data acquisition to areas that help
designers fulfill design goals. We validate the proposed framework in three
hypothetical deployment scenarios, which encompass general use, task-aware use,
and tailorable use. Two large-scale shape-only mechanical metamaterial datasets
are used as test datasets. The results demonstrate that t-METASET can
incrementally grow task-aware datasets. Applicable to general design
representations, t-METASET can boost future advancements of not only
metamaterials but data-driven design in other domains.",arxiv

  chemical sensors","High throughput characterization and processing techniques are becoming
increasingly necessary to navigate multivariable, data-driven design challenges

performance is highly dependent upon a vast array of material properties
including number of layers, lattice strain, carrier concentration, defect

locally pattern and transform hundreds of regions of amorphous MoS2 thin films
into 2D 2H-MoS2. A high throughput Raman spectroscopy approach was subsequently
used to assess the process-dependent structural and compositional variations
for each illuminated region, yielding over 5500 distinct non-resonant,
resonant, and polarized Raman spectra. The rapid generation of a comprehensive
library of structural and compositional data elucidated important trends
between structure-property-processing relationships involving
laser-crystallized MoS2, including the relationships between grain size, grain
orientation, and intrinsic strain. Moreover, extensive analysis of

When one actually wants to make such an optical device, one can predict its
optical behavior using computational simulations of Maxwell's equations. If one
then asks what the optimal design would be in order to obtain a certain optical
behavior, the only way to go further would be to try out all of the possible
designs and compute the electromagnetic spectrum they produce. When there are
many design parameters, this brute force approach quickly becomes too
computationally expensive. We therefore need other methods to create optimal
optical devices. An alternative to the brute force approach is inverse design.
In this paradigm, one starts from the desired optical response of a material
and then determines the design parameters that are needed to obtain this
optical response. There are many algorithms known in the literature that
implement this inverse design. Some of the best performing, recent approaches
are based on Deep Learning. The central idea is to train a neural network to
predict the optical response for given design parameters. Since neural networks
are completely differentiable, we can compute gradients of the response with
respect to the design parameters. We can use these gradients to update the
design parameters and get an optical response closer to the one we want. This
allows us to obtain an optimal design much faster compared to the brute force
approach. In my thesis, I use Deep Learning for the inverse design of the
Fabry-P\'erot resonator. This system can be described fully analytically and is
therefore ideal to study.",arxiv

network (DNN)-aided system whose architecture follows the operation of the
model-based Kalman filter (KF), to learn its mapping in an unsupervised manner,
i.e., without requiring ground-truth states. The unsupervised adaptation is
achieved by exploiting the hybrid model-based/data-driven architecture of
KalmanNet, which internally predicts the next observation as the KF does. These
internal features are then used to compute the loss rather than the state
estimate at the output of the system. With the capability of unsupervised
learning, one can use KalmanNet not only to track the hidden state, but also to
adapt to variations in the state space (SS) model. We numerically demonstrate
that when the noise statistics are unknown, unsupervised KalmanNet achieves a
similar performance to KalmanNet with supervised learning. We also show that we
can adapt a pre-trained KalmanNet to changing SS models without providing
additional data thanks to the unsupervised capabilities.",arxiv

opportunities for optoelectronic applications as well as significant challenges

develop a framework powered by high-throughput computations and machine
learning for the design and prediction of mixed cation halide perovskite
alloys. In a chemical space of ABX$_{3}$ perovskites with a selected set of
options for A, B, and X atoms, pseudo-cubic structures of compounds with B-site
mixing are simulated using density functional theory (DFT) and several
properties are computed, including stability, lattice constant, band gap,
vacancy formation energy, refractive index, and optical absorption spectrum,
using both semi-local and hybrid functionals. Neural networks (NN) are used to
train predictive models for every property using tabulated elemental properties
of A, B, and X site atoms as descriptors. Starting from the DFT dataset of 229

general-purpose adaptation procedure via (stochastic) gradient descent, while
modular meta-learning finds a set of reusable modules that can form components

around objects to make them indistinguishable from their homogeneous
surroundings. Typically, methods based on material-parameter transformations
are used to design optical, thermal and electric cloaks. However, they are not
applicable in designing mechanical cloaks, since continuum-mechanics equations
are not form-invariant under general coordinate transformations. As a result,
existing design methods for mechanical cloaks have so far been limited to a
narrow selection of voids with simple shapes. To address this challenge, we
present a systematic, data-driven design approach to create mechanical cloaks
composed of aperiodic metamaterials using a large pre-computed unit cell
database. Our method is flexible to allow the design of cloaks with various
boundary conditions, multiple loadings, different shapes and numbers of voids,
and different homogeneous surroundings. It enables a concurrent optimization of
both topology and properties distribution of the cloak. Compared to
conventional fixed-shape solutions, this results in an overall better cloaking
performance, and offers unparalleled versatility. Experimental measurements on
3D-printed structures further confirm the validity of the proposed approach.
Our research illustrates the benefits of data-driven approaches in quickly
responding to new design scenarios and resolving the computational challenge

Fourier samples of the FRI signals are used for reconstruction. The
reconstruction quality depends on the choice of Fourier samples and recovery

greedy subsampling algorithm and a learning-based sparse recovery method.
Unlike existing techniques, the proposed algorithm can flexibly handle changes
in the sampling rate and does not suffer from differentiability issues during
training. Importantly, exact knowledge of the FRI pulse is not required.
Numerical results show that, for a given number of samples, the proposed joint

Gaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,
they have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and
multiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of
data-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that
utilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference
to address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built
upon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical
factors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of
mixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the
large training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address
the scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear
combination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel
structure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.
Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large
datasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art
machine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In
addition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the

deep unfolding of first-order optimization iterations. LoRD-Net has a
task-based architecture dedicated to recovering the underlying signal of
interest from the one-bit noisy measurements without requiring prior knowledge
of the channel matrix through which the one-bit measurements are obtained. The
proposed deep detector has much fewer parameters compared to black-box deep

compound of this class is Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge, and its discovery is the result of
first principles theory combined with experimental synthesis and
characterisation. The theory is based on a high-throughput/data-mining search
among materials listed in the ICSD database. From ab-initio theory of the
defect free material it is predicted that the saturation magnetization is 1.71
T, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is 1.44 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie
temperature is 700 K. Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge samples were then synthesized and
characterised with respect to structure and magnetism. The crystal structure

crystallographic lattice sites. From magnetization measurements a saturation
polarization of 0.86 T at 10 K was detected, together with a uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of 1.18 MJ/m$^3$, and the Curie

Co$_3$Mn$_2$Ge a very promising material as a rare-earth free permanent magnet,

gold standards of today's diagnostic imaging. The most significant drawback of
MRI is long acquisition times, prohibiting its use in standard practice for
some applications. Compressed sensing (CS) proposes to subsample the k-space
(the Fourier domain dual to the physical space of spatial coordinates) leading
to significantly accelerated acquisition. However, the benefit of compressed
sensing has not been fully exploited; most of the sampling densities obtained
through CS do not produce a trajectory that obeys the stringent constraints of
the MRI machine imposed in practice. Inspired by recent success of deep
learning based approaches for image reconstruction and ideas from computational
imaging on learning-based design of imaging systems, we introduce 3D FLAT, a
novel protocol for data-driven design of 3D non-Cartesian accelerated
trajectories in MRI. Our proposal leverages the entire 3D k-space to
simultaneously learn a physically feasible acquisition trajectory with a
reconstruction method. Experimental results, performed as a proof-of-concept,
suggest that 3D FLAT achieves higher image quality for a given readout time
compared to standard trajectories such as radial, stack-of-stars, or 2D learned
trajectories (trajectories that evolve only in the 2D plane while fully
sampling along the third dimension). Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence

non-Cartesian 3D trajectories over 2D non-Cartesian trajectories acquired

prevailing experimental and numerical methods are normally too costly and
time-consuming to determine the elastic isotropy of architectured materials

mechanical characterization is thus desired for the advanced design of

materials directly from the images of their representative microstructures with
arbitrary component distributions. The measure of elastic isotropy for
architectured materials is derived firstly in this paper to construct a
database with associated images of microstructures. Then a convolutional neural
network is trained with the database. It is found that the convolutional neural
network shows good performance on the isotropy identification. Meanwhile, it
exhibits enough robustness to maintain the performance under fluctuated
material properties in practical fabrications. Moreover, the well-trained
convolutional neural network can be successfully transferred among different
types of architectured materials, including two-phase composites and porous

the design space beyond where such models were trained. Therefore, one can ask:
should the regression model be altered as the design algorithm explores the

the dependence on data induces a unique challenge: An imbalanced dataset

unit cells in both shape and property spaces, and 2) incorporates Determinantal
Point Processes for efficient subset selection. Moreover, METASET allows the
trade-off between shape and property diversity so that subsets can be tuned for
various applications. Through the design of 2D metamaterials with target
displacement profiles, we demonstrate that smaller, diverse subsets can indeed
improve the search process as well as structural performance. By eliminating
inherent overlaps in a dataset of 3D unit cells created with symmetry rules, we
also illustrate that our flexible method can distill unique subsets regardless

paradigms; typically, the former performs representation learning with
pre-specified architectures, while the latter is characterised by learning
hierarchies over pre-specified features with data-driven architectures. We
unite the two via adaptive neural trees (ANTs) that incorporates representation
learning into edges, routing functions and leaf nodes of a decision tree, along
with a backpropagation-based training algorithm that adaptively grows the
architecture from primitive modules (e.g., convolutional layers). We
demonstrate that, whilst achieving competitive performance on classification
and regression datasets, ANTs benefit from (i) lightweight inference via
conditional computation, (ii) hierarchical separation of features useful to the
task e.g. learning meaningful class associations, such as separating natural
vs. man-made objects, and (iii) a mechanism to adapt the architecture to the
size and complexity of the training dataset.",arxiv

sources for art creation, embracing the resulting collisions and heterogeneity.
This paper discusses the use of maximalism in game design and particularly in
data games, which are games that are generated partly based on open data. Using
Data Adventures, a series of generators that create adventure games from data
sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap, as a lens we explore several
tradeoffs and issues in maximalist game design. This includes the tension
between transformation and fidelity, between decorative and functional content,
and legal and ethical issues resulting from this type of generativity. This
paper sketches out the design space of maximalist data-driven games, a design
space that is mostly unexplored.",arxiv

control objectives is developed for multiple input-single output systems. The
main advantage of the data-driven control over the model-based control is its
ability to use the frequency response measurements of the controlled plant
directly without the need to identify a model for the plant. In the proposed
methodology, multiple sets of measurements can be considered in the design
process to accommodate variations in the system dynamics. The controller is
obtained by translating the mixed H2/H-infinity control objectives into a
convex optimization problem. The H-infinity norm is used to shape closed loop
transfer functions and guarantee closed loop stability, while the H2 norm is
used to constrain and/or minimize the variance of signals in the time domain.
  The proposed data-driven design methodology is used to design a track
following controller for a dual-stage HDD. The sensitivity decoupling
structure[16] is considered as the controller structure. The compensators
inside this controller structure are designed and compared by decoupling the
system into two single input-single-output systems as well as solving for a
single input-double output controller.",arxiv

opportunities for data-driven approaches. Highly-automated frameworks like
AFLOW not only manage the generation, storage, and dissemination of materials
data, but also leverage the information for thermodynamic formability modeling,
such as the prediction of phase diagrams and properties of disordered
materials. In combination with standardized parameter sets, the wealth of data
is ideal for training machine learning algorithms, which have already been
employed for property prediction, descriptor development, design rule
discovery, and the identification of candidate functional materials. These
methods promise to revolutionize the path to synthesis and, ultimately,
transform the practice of traditional materials discovery to one of rational
and autonomous materials design.",arxiv

  Embedded in a Periodic Business Process","We present a widely-used operations management model used in supply and

each regarding suitability for accuracy, modification, analysis, and transfer.
We consider the degree of training and technical sophistication required to

CMOS/Spintronics devices in comprehensive simulation environments require a
full description of stochastic switching processes in state of the art

formulas with results achieved numerically within a full micromagnetic

filter from plant input/output data collected under fault-free condition. This
problem is challenging, especially when omitting the step of building an
explicit state-space plant model in data-driven design, because the inverse of
the underlying plant dynamics is required and needs to be stable. We show that
it is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based
fault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov
parameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by
avoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from
identification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter.
Furthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained
filter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based
system inversion. This crucial property enables its application to sensor
faults in unstable plants, where existing data-driven filter designs could not
be applied so far due to the lack of such stability guarantees (even after
stabilizing the closed-loop system). A numerical simulation example of sensor
faults in an unstable aircraft system illustrates the effectiveness of the
proposed new method.",arxiv
