As one of the developments, heterogeneous cloud computing has enabled a variety of cloud-based infrastructure solutions, such as multimedia big data. Numerous prior researches have explored the optimizations of on-premise heterogeneous memories. However, the heterogeneous cloud memories are facing constraints due to the performance limitations and cost concerns caused by the hardware distributions and manipulative mechanisms. Assigning data tasks to distributed memories with various capacities is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a novel approach, Cost-Aware Heterogeneous Cloud Memory Model (CAHCM), aiming to provision a high performance cloud-based heterogeneous memory service offerings. The main algorithm supporting CAHCM is Dynamic Data Allocation Advance (2DA) Algorithm that uses genetic programming to determine the data allocations on the cloud-based memories. In our proposed approach, we consider a set of crucial factors impacting the performance of the cloud memories, such as communication costs, data move operating costs, energy performance, and time constraints. Finally, we implement experimental evaluations to examine our proposed model. The experimental results have shown that our approach is adoptable and feasible for being a cost-aware cloud-based solution.",IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing,2020,citation

Researchers have proposed collaborative edge computing for IoT where the data and computation tasks are shared among a network of edge devices. One of the important problems in collaborative edge computing is to schedule tasks among edge devices to minimize latency and other performance metrics. Compared to existing works in wireless sensor networks and IoT, there are two additional challenges while scheduling tasks in collaborative edge computing. First, we need to consider the transfer of input data required by different tasks as the data is generated by sensing devices which are located at different geographical places. Second, existing works solve the problem of task scheduling without considering network flow scheduling which can lead to network congestion and long completion times. In this paper, we study the data-aware task allocation problem to jointly schedule task and network flows in collaborative edge computing. We mathematically model the joint problem to minimize the overall completion time of the application. We have proposed a multistage greedy adjustment (MSGA) algorithm where the task scheduling is done by considering both placement of tasks and adjustment of network flows. Performance comparison done using simulation shows that MSGA leads to up to 27% improvement in completion time as compared to benchmark solutions.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019,citation

Being able to react quickly and intelligently to fast-changing markets is a decisive success factor for trading companies. To date, the rise of QF requires an integrated toolchain of enabling technologies to carry out complex event processing on the explosive growth and diversified forms of market metadata, in pursuit of a microsecond latency on an Exabyte-level dataset. Inspired by this, we present a data-driven execution paradigm that untangles the dependencies of complex processing events and integrate the paradigm with a big data infrastructure that streams time series data. This integrated platform is termed as the QuantCloud platform. Essentially, QuantCloud executes the complex event processing in a data-driven mode and manages large amounts of diversified market data in a data-parallel mode. To show its practicability and performance, we develop a prototype and benchmark by applying real-world QF research models on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data. Using this prototype, we demonstrate this platform with an application to: (i) data cleaning and aggregating (including the computing of logarithmic returns from tick data and the finding the medians of grouped data) and (ii) data modeling: the autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model. The performance results show that (a) this platform obtains a high throughput (usually in the order of millions of tick messages per second) and a sub-microsecond latency; (b) it fully executes data-dependent tasks through a data-driven execution; and (c) it implements a modular design approach for rapidly developing these data-crunching methods and QF research models. This platform resulting from an aggregated effort of the data-driven execution and big data infrastructure, offers the financial engineers with new insights and enhanced capabilities for effective and efficient incorporation of big data complex event processing technologies in their workflow.",IEEE Transactions on Big Data,2019,citation

First of all, software designers need new methods to fill the gap between applications description and tasks deployment. Secondly, the use of multiple cores has also to remain compatible with real-time and safety design constraints. Finally, developers need tools to assist them in the new steps of the design process. Face to these issues, we proposed a method integrated in the AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) design flow for partitioning the automotive applications onto multi-core systems. The method proposes the partitions solution that contains allocation of application as well as scheduling policy simultaneously. The design space of the partitioning is explored automatically and the solutions are evaluated thanks to our proposed objective functions that consider certain criteria such as communication overhead and global jitters. For the scheduling part, we present a formalization of periodic dependencies adapted to this automotive framework and propose a scheduling algorithm taking into account this specificity. Our defined constraints from real-time aspect as well as functional aspect make sure the applicability of our method on the real life user case.

However, in the rise of IoT, there is at least one question that has been left unanswered: Can Quantitative Finance (QF) benefit from IoT? The QF is a field that extends sophisticated mathematical models and utilizes advanced computer techniques to link with global finance markets. By taking market and social information as input, a QF model can derive profitable insights and control the risk to make trading decisions. Today, many Internet-based techniques are extensively employed in the field as: (a) market and social data is provided via Internet; (b) big data infrastructures are built in the Cloud; and (c) deep learning tools are accessible in Internet. Even trading models and strategies could be exerted through Internet. In this paper, we will provide an overview of challenges and opportunities presented by this new paradigm in the QF industry.

Mathematics, statistics and computers algorithms have never been so important to financial practitioners in history. Investment banks develop equilibrium models to evaluate financial instruments; mutual funds applied time series to identify the risks in their portfolio; and hedge funds hope to extract market signals and statistical arbitrage from noisy market data. The rise of quantitative finance in the last decade relies on the development of computer techniques that make processing large datasets possible. As more data is available at a higher frequency, more researches in quantitative finance have switched to the microstructures of financial market. High frequency data is a typical example of big data that is characterized by the 3V’s: velocity, variety and volume. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio in financial time series is usually very small. High frequency datasets are more likely to be exposed to extreme values, jumps and errors than the low frequency ones. Specific data processing techniques and quantitative models are elaborately designed to extract information from financial data efficiently. In this chapter, we present the quantitative data analysis approaches in finance. First, we review the development of quantitative finance in the past decade. Then we discuss the characteristics of high frequency data and the challenges it brings. The quantitative data analysis consists of two basic steps: (i) data cleaning and aggregating; (ii) data modeling. We review the mathematics tools and computing technologies behind the two steps. The valuable information extracted from raw data is represented by a group of statistics. The most widely used statistics in finance are expected return and volatility, which are the fundamentals of modern portfolio theory. We further introduce some simple portfolio optimization strategies as an example of the application of financial data analysis. Big data has already changed financial industry fundamentally; while quantitative tools for addressing massive financial data still have a long way to go. Adoptions of advanced statistics, information theory, machine learning and faster computing algorithms are inevitable in order to predict complicated financial markets. These topics are briefly discussed in the later part of this chapter.",Handbook of Big Data Technologies,2017,citation

From a network management perspective, it is both important and challenging to enable evolution towards such new architectures. Given the ubiquity of the Internet, a clean-slate change of the entire infrastructure to a new architecture is impractical. It is believed that we will see new network architectures coming into existence with support for interoperability between separate architectural islands. We may have servers, and more importantly, content, residing in domains having different architectures. This paper presents COIN, a content-oriented interoperability framework for current and future Internet architectures. We seek to provide seamless connectivity and content accessibility across multiple of these network architectures, including the current Internet. COIN preserves each domain's key architectural features and mechanisms, while allowing flexibility for evolvability and extensibility. We focus on Information-Centric Networks (ICN), the prominent class of Future Internet architectures. COIN avoids expanding domain-specific protocols or namespaces. Instead, it uses an application-layer Object Resolution Service to deliver the right ""foreign"" names to consumers. COIN uses translation gateways that retain essential interoperability state, leverages encryption for confidentiality, and relies on domain-specific signatures to guarantee provenance and data integrity. Using NDN and MobilityFirst as important candidate solutions of ICN, and IP, we evaluate COIN. Measurements from an implementation of the gateways show that the overhead is manageable and scales well.",2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),2020,citation

This strategy aims at benefits from the use of ICN-based routing while maintaining backward compatibility with IP-based services. In the long run, an ICN-based Internet architecture may emerge from the interconnection of these ICN-based islands. We assess the feasibility of this strategy by discussing the willingness of Internet stakeholders to adopt one particular IP-over-ICN implementation based on the Publish-Subscribe Internet Technologies (PURSUIT) for flow-based routing, multicast routing, and service routing. We suggest that the IP-over-PURSUIT solution offers viable mechanisms for IP interoperability and routing scalability as well as potential advantages in comparison to substitutes, including IP-based solutions, such as IPv6; Multiprotocol Level Switching; and hybrid ICN; as well as other IP-over-ICN implementations based on Content-Centric Networking. We indicate that triple play operators and micro-operators have a greater incentive to adopt IP-over-PURSUIT since they can maximize the utilization of the multicast and service routing, respectively. However, we argue that IP-over-PURSUIT requires new exterior inter-stakeholder interfaces for significant operator traffic to be delivered through its new and cost-efficient routing capabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of operator adoption. Finally, we suggest that the advent of an ICN-based Internet architecture might be delayed until Internet stakeholders can trustworthily delegate the delivery of valuable content and services via information-based exchange points.",Telecommun.

Data storage units, however, require additional energy, which offers a challenge to researchers who intend to reduce energy consumption up to 90% in next generation networks. The concept of powering data storage units by renewable energy aligns with this energy reduction target. In this article, we introduce a proactive caching strategy, which caches content in helper nodes in a cooperative manner considering intermittent renewable energy and variable content load for various hours of the day. The hypothesis is that the amount of renewable energy available to various helper nodes varies depending on the node location and time of the day. The content load across helper nodes also varies with time. As such, if helper nodes work cooperatively by considering the available renewable energy and content load at each helper node, the aggregate non-renewable energy consumption for content caching can be further reduced. We model the research challenge as an optimization problem. Furthermore, we also present a heuristic solution. Our proposed scheme achieves a significant reduction in non-renewable energy consumption by 23% over the existing green solution.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2020,citation

ICN decouples content from its location by caching, which can later be retrieved by consumers from their nearest locations. Various experimental studies have depicted the performance merits of dynamic adaptive streaming via HTTP (DASH) over ICN for improving QoS. However, there are two challenges that need to be addressed in the context of DASH over an ICN environment. The first one from content consumer domain is that the relevance, integrity, and provenance (RIP) of content should be guaranteed. RIP ensures trust establishment between publisher and consumer of content. The second one that concerns the content publisher is the confidentiality of DASH media, so that any consumer can view the particular quality or resolution of video based on his designated privileged rights. We address these two mentioned issues with the context of DASH over ICN. The performance and security analysis of our scheme depict its effectiveness for enforcing access control of adaptive streaming media in an ICN environment.",Journal of Communications and Networks,2019,citation

Ainsi, cette these a pour objectif d’etudier et de lever les principaux verrous technologiques empechant l’adoption du protocole NDN (Name Data Networking) par les operateur en garantissant la securite, les performances, l’interoperabilite, la bonne gestion et le deploiement automatise d’un reseau NDN. Dans un premier temps, nous evaluons les performances actuelles d’un reseau NDN a l’aide d’un outil de notre conception, ndnperf, et constatons le cout eleve pour un serveur utilisant ce protocole. Puis nous proposons un ensemble de solutions pour ameliorer l’efficacite d’un serveur NDN pouvant etre jusqu’a 6,4 fois plus efficient que les parametres de base. Ensuite nous nous interessons a la securite de NDN a travers l’evaluation de l’attaque par empoisonnement de contenus, connue pour etre critique mais jamais caracterisee. Cette etude se base sur deux scenarios, en utilisant un serveur et un client pour effectuer la pollution, ou en exploitant une faille dans le traitement des paquets au niveau du routeur. Nous montrons ainsi la dangerosite de l’attaque et proposons une correction de la faille la permettant. Dans un troisieme temps, nous cherchons a adapter le protocole HTTP pour qu’il puisse etre transporte sur un reseau NDN a des fins d’interoperabilite. Pour ce faire, nous avons developpe deux passerelles qui effectuent les conversions necessaires pour qu’un contenu web puisse rentrer ou sortir d’un reseau NDN. Apres avoir decrit notre solution, nous l’evaluons et l’ameliorons afin de pouvoir beneficier d’une fonctionnalite majeure de NDN, a savoir la mise en cache des contenus dans le reseau a hauteur de 61,3% lors de tests synthetiques et 25,1% lors de simulations de navigation avec plusieurs utilisateurs utilisant une loi Zipf de parametre 1,5. Pour finir, nous proposons une architecture a base de microservices virtualises et orchestres pour le deploiement du protocole NDN en suivant le paradigme NFV (Network Function Virtualization).

Ces fonctions peuvent ensuite etre chainees pour constituer un reseau optimise. Cette architecture est orchestree a l’aide d’un manager qui nous permet de pleinement tirer parti des avantages des microservices comme la mise a l’echelle des composants les plus lents ou encore le changement dynamique de topologie en cas d’attaque.Une telle architecture, associee aux contributions precedentes, permettrait un deploiement rapide du protocole NDN, notamment grâce a un developpement facilite des fonctions, a l’execution sur du materiel conventionnel, ou encore grâce a la flexibilite qu’oﬀre ce type d’architecture.",,2019,citation

By reusing existing packet formats, hICN brings innovation inside the IP stack, requiring minimal software upgrades and guaranteeing transparent interconnection with existing IP networks. Secondly, the thesis focuses on the problem of deploying ICN at the network endpoints, namely at the end host, by designing a transport framework and a socket API that can be used in several ICN architectures such as NDN, CCN and hICN. The framework fosters cutting-edge technologies aiming at providing performance and efficiency to applications. An extensive benchmarking at the end of the chapter will present the performance of the transport framework. Subsequently, the benefits that hICN network and transport services can bring to applications will be assessed, by considering two main use cases: HTTP and WebRTC.

As NDN begins to incrementally deploy on the real-world, there will be a hybrid network of TCP/IP and NDN during the transitional period. However, redeveloping TCP/IP- based applications for NDN is a daunting and time-consuming task. Thus, a more sensible and economical approach is to design an effective strategies for leveraging NDN to deliver IP datagrams and porting TCP/IP-based applications on NDN without chang­ing its original code. Towards this end, this paper introduces three different migration methods at Internet layer, TCP layer and application layer, respectively to translate TCP/IP-based packets into NDN packets and run TCP/IP-based applications on NDN. By implementing these methods on a real NDN test-bed, we demonstrate the multi-level IP/NDN translation and migration mechanism is feasible. The analysis of testing results shows that each of the proposed methods is valid with varying benefits and costs: translating at TCP layer with more time overhead can have a less packets overhead than Internet layer. And when translated at application layer, the network load is reduced by half because of the in-network cache.",NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium,2018,citation

Having a flexible environment would allow network operators to initiate the deployment of new network solutions at low cost and low risk. The virtualization techniques, appeared a few years ago, can help to provide such a flexible networking architecture. However, with it, emerge monitoring and security issues which should be solved.

However, the existing web browsers and servers are mainly designed for the HTTP protocol over TCP/IP networks and cannot directly support CCN-based web applications. Existing research mainly focuses on plug-in or proxy/gateway approaches at client and server sides, and these schemes seriously impact the service performance due to multiple protocol conversions. To address above problems, we designed and implemented a CCN web browser and a CCN web server to natively support CCN protocol. To facilitate the smooth evolution from IP networks to CCN, CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat also support the HTTP protocol besides the CCN.

As a consequence, request routing, which selects the best server to serve the requested data, is introduced to meet the mismatch between CDN and IP. In contrast to IP, Named Data Networking (NDN) makes content the first-class citizen of the network. Its specialties, such as multicast, content multihoming, cache and content-oriented security, are designed for large scale data delivery. Due to the essential consistency between CDN and NDN, we propose Named Content Delivery Network, or nCDN, which embeds NDN into existing CDN framework to simplify the implementation and improve the efficiency. nCDN supports existing running CDN infrastructure, by setting up NDN over UDP/TCP. NDN takes charge of request routing and content delivery only; While other components of CDN, such as billing, accounting, data analysis, data management etc, remain changeless. The advantages of nCDN include: 1) As NDN's routing plane holds content distribution information, requests are routed to the best data copies straightforward. 2) NDN's stateful forwarding plane detects the network state in real time, and responses to congestion, link or node failure quickly. 3) NDN naturally supports multicast and content multihoming. Multicast eliminates identical requests, while content multihoming fully utilizes redundant resources, such as bandwidth and storage.",2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS),2014,citation

CCN routers can directly respond to the Interest request by Content Store (CS) and aggregate the same Interest packets by Pending Interest Table (PIT). In this way, most popular content requests will not reach the origin content server. Thus, content providers will be unaware of the actual usages of their contents in network. This new network paradigm presents content providers with unprecedented challenge. It will bring a great impact on existing mature business model of content providers, such as advertising revenue model based on hits amount. To leverage the advantages of CCN and the realistic business needs of content providers, we explore the hits-based content provisioning mechanism in CCN.

In contrast, NDN (Named Data Networking), provides the information and function that traditional CDN devotes a great deal of effort to achieve, since NDN routes by name, its routing plane holds the“what”, information of content distribution, and its stateful forwarding plane can detect and adapt to dynamic of the Internet. Thus this work enhances current CDN with NDN, here dubbed Named Content Delivery Network, or nCDN. In nCDN, CDN itself focuses on services such as accounting, data analysis etc; NDN runs over IP and takes charge of content routing and delivery. nCDN is more adaptive to the dynamic of the Internet and improves the performance, especially in a scenario where content copies are hosted in several hosts. nCDN makes it easier to implement optimization solutions and CDN Interconnecting.

Challenges include but are not limited to an optimization solution for avoiding excessive runtime overhead, reducing provenance-related data storage, and providing it in an easy-to-use fashion. Without any prior knowledge about which kinds of data may finally lead to the abnormal, we have to track all transformations in detail, which potentially causes hard system burden. This paper proposes s2p (Stream Process Provenance), which mainly consists of online provenance and offline provenance, to provide fine- and coarse-grained provenance in different precision. We base our design of s2p on the fact that, for a mature online DSP system, the abnormal results are rare, and the results that require a detailed analysis are even rarer. We also consider state transition in our provenance explanation. We implement s2p on Apache Flink named as s2p-flink and conduct three experiments to evaluate its scalability, efficiency, and overhead from end-to-end cost, throughput, and space overhead. Our evaluation shows that s2p-flink incurs a 13% to 32% cost overhead, 11% to 24% decline in throughput, and few additional space costs in the online provenance phase.

As such, making timely decisions based on these results is dependent on a system’s ability to tolerate failure. Typically, these systems achieve fault tolerance and the ability to recover automatically from partial failures by implementing checkpoint and rollback recovery. However, owing to the statistical probability of partial failures occurring in these distributed environments and the variability of workloads upon which jobs are expected to operate, static configurations will often not meet Quality of Service constraints with low overhead. In this paper we present Khaos, a new approach which utilizes the parallel processing capabilities of virtual cloud automation technologies for the automatic runtime optimization of fault tolerance configurations in Distributed Stream Processing jobs. Our approach employs three subsequent phases which borrows from the principles of Chaos Engineering: establish the steadystate processing conditions, conduct experiments to better understand how the system performs under failure, and use this knowledge to continuously minimize Quality of Service violations. We implemented Khaos prototypically together with Apache Flink and demonstrate its usefulness experimentally.",ArXiv,2021,citation

They are an essential part of many data-intensive applications and analytics platforms. The rate at which events arrive at DSP systems can vary considerably over time, which may be due to trends, cyclic, and seasonal patterns within the data streams. A priori knowledge of incoming workloads enables proactive approaches to resource management and optimization tasks such as dynamic scaling, live migration of resources, and the tuning of configuration parameters during run-times, thus leading to a potentially better Quality of Service. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different load prediction techniques for DSP jobs. We identify three use-cases and formulate requirements for making load predictions specific to DSP jobs. Automatically optimized classical and Deep Learning methods are being evaluated on nine different datasets from typical DSP domains, i.e. the IoT, Web 2.0, and cluster monitoring.

This study proposes a real-time architecture that uses Apache Storm and Apache Kafka to apply different NLP tasks on streams of textual data. The architecture allows developers to inject NLP modules to it via different programming languages.

There is always a huge requirement of storing immense volumes of heterogeneous data in different formats. In big data steam processing applications, the storage is given a priority and always plays a big role in historical data analysis. During stream processing, some of the incoming data and the intermediate results are always a good source of future samples. These samples can be used for the future evaluation to eliminate the numerous mistakes of storing and maintaining the big data streams. Hence, a big data stream application requires an efficient support for storage of historical queries. The researchers, scientist and academicians are working hard to develop a sophisticated mechanism that is needed for storage to keep the most useful data for the future references by means of stream archive storage. However, a stream processing system can’t store the whole incoming stream data for future references. A technique is needed to get rid of the expired data and free the space for more incoming data in an archive storage. Hence keeping in view, the storage space limitation, integration issues and its associated cost, we try to optimize the stream archive storage and free more space for future data. The proposed enhanced algorithm will help to delete the obsolete data (retention or expired) and free the space for the new incoming data in a distributed platform. Our paper presents an Enhanced Time Expired Algorithm (ETEA) for stream archived storage in a distributed environment for removing the obsolete data based on time expiration and providing a space for the new incoming data for historical data analysis during the skew time (Hot Spots).We also evaluated the efficiency of our algorithm using the skew factor. The experimental results show that our approach is 98% efficient and fast than other conventional techniques.",,2020,citation

In particular, smart approaches to manage and analyze data directly on the network edge, are more and more investigated, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered edge computing is envisaged to be a promising direction. In this article, we focus on data centers (DCs) and supercomputers (SCs), where a new generation of high-resolution monitoring systems is being deployed, opening new opportunities for analysis like anomaly detection and security, but introducing new challenges for handling the vast amount of data it produces. In detail, we report on a novel lightweight and scalable approach to increase the security of DCs/SCs, which involves AI-powered edge computing on high-resolution power consumption. The method—called pAElla—targets real-time malware detection (MD), it runs on an out-of-band IoT-based monitoring system for DCs/SCs, and involves power spectral density of power measurements, along with autoencoders. Results are promising, with an F1-score close to 1, and a false alarm and malware miss rate close to 0%. We compare our method with State-of-the-Art (SoA) MD techniques and show that, in the context of DCs/SCs, pAElla can cover a wider range of malware, significantly outperforming SoA approaches in terms of accuracy.

If congestion occurs, it is fed back to the sending end. The sending end adjusts the sending speed according to the feedback. Because the network is dynamically changing, the route chosen by each packet may be different, so the time delay to reach the client will be different, even It is possible to send the first data packet later.

A systematic literature review for real-time stream processing systems is presented in this paper which rigorously look at the recent developments and challenges of real-time stream processing systems and can serve as a guide for the implementation of real-time stream processing framework for all shapes of data streams. Background: Published surveys and reviews either cover papers focusing on stream analysis in applications other than real-time DWH or focusing on extraction, transformation, loading (ETL) challenges for traditional DWH. This systematic review attempts to answer four specific research questions. Research Questions: 1)Which are the relevant publication channels for real-time stream processing research? 2) Which challenges have been faced during implementation of real-time stream processing? 3) Which approaches/tools have been reported to address challenges introduced at ETL stage while processing real-time stream for real-time DWH? 4) What evidence have been reported while addressing different challenges for processing real-time stream? Methodology: A systematic literature was conducted to compile studies related to publication channels targeting real-time stream processing/joins challenges and developments. Following a formal protocol, semi-automatic and manual searches were performed for work from 2011 to 2020 excluding research in traditional data warehousing. Of 679,547 papers selected for data extraction, 74 were retained after quality assessment. Findings: This systematic literature highlights implementation challenges along with developed approaches for real-time DWH and big data stream processing systems and provides their comparisons.

Adjusting the parallelism of tasks has a direct impact on the overall level of throughput a job can provide as well as the amount of resources required to provide an adequate level of service. However, finding optimal parallelism configurations that fall within the expected Quality of Service requirements is no small feat to accomplish. In this paper we present Rafiki, an approach to automatically determine optimal parallelism configurations for Distributed Stream Processing jobs. Here we conduct a number of proactive profiling runs to gather information about the processing capacities of individual tasks, thereby making the selection of specific utilization targets possible.

However, business practice shows that digitization can be associated not only with the prospect of development but with numerous limitations that a company may struggle with. The goal of this manuscript is to verify the existence and identify of the management gaps that lead to formation of digitization problems in companies under the conditions of Industry 4.0. Management gap is understood here as a set of discontinuities, identified within management functions, which result in specific problems in the implementation of digitization projects. In general, this aspect is omitted in the literature on the subject, which focuses on benefits of implementing Industry 4.0 technology. The chosen goal of the manuscript is part of the research trend related to the identification of general digitization problems and to a company’s development, taking into account the use of technological solutions, as well as to the scope of research on the problems of implementing ICT projects. The development of an enterprise is understood as the ability to improve an organization both in the face of internal challenges and the environmental with maintaining innovation potential. The research structure is based on the construction of a conceptual model of management gaps and its empirical verification. In the theoretical part, the chosen research method is analysis of literature from the last 20 years and in the practical part analysis of a business case supplemented with an in-depth interview conducted among the management of the analyzed company. In the theoretical part, the article defines basic concepts related to Industry 4.0 and digitization of companies. It presents the place and role of digitization and its impact on the blurring of boundaries of traditional management layers. Based on these considerations, a conceptual model is developed defining management gaps within which problems of digitization of enterprises are indicated. The practical part of the article presents an empirical verification of the existence of the formulated management gaps on the basis of a business case analysis. The case study describes a mass, geographically dispersed implementation of the application for 34,000 users, which is the result of the implementation of the digitization strategy. Conclusions were formulated in the last part of the manuscript. On the theoretical ground, the analysis confirms that the process of digitization in an enterprise under the conditions of Industry 4.0 is related to blurring the boundaries of operational, tactical and strategic management. The premises of the said blur are identifiable and appear in each of the above-mentioned layers. On the practical ground, the existence of reasons for blurring the boundaries of management is related to the need to adapt the organization to the new operating conditions related to Industry 4.0. The strategic activities should be targeted at determining the directions of company improvement, which should precede the efforts to implement advanced solutions in the field of Industry 4.0. This approach allows providing a sustainable company development with the possibility of creating short-term effects and maintaining a long-term growth perspective.",Sustainability,2021,citation

In the ICN architectures that use the identifier–locator separation mode, a name resolution system (NRS) is an important infrastructure for managing and maintaining the mappings between identifiers and locators. To meet the demands of time-sensitive applications, researchers have developed a distributed local NRS that can provide name resolution service within deterministic latency, which means it can respond to a name resolution request within a latency upper bound. However, processing name resolution requests only locally cannot take full advantage of the potential of the distributed local NRS. In this paper, we propose a name resolution approach, called adjacency-information-entropy-based cooperative name resolution (ACNR). In ACNR, when a name resolution node receives a name resolution request from a user, it can use neighboring name resolution nodes to respond to this request in a parallel processing manner. For this purpose, ACNR uses the information entropy that takes into account the adjacency and latency between name resolution nodes to describe the local structure of nodes efficiently. The proposed approach is extensively validated on simulated networks. Compared with several other approaches, the experiment results show that ACNR can discover more cooperative neighbors in a reasonable communication overhead, and achieve a higher name resolution success rate.",Future Internet,2022,citation

For this, smart vehicles need to deal with various types of data for safety and infotainment, such as real-time traffic, multi-media contents, documents and weather information. Recently, a fleet of vehicles connected to other vehicles and infrastructure (i.e., road side units) using a legacy or 5G mmWave spectrum has been considered as a platform to cooperate for those new tasks, known as the vehicular cloud or fog. Within the vehicular cloud, data management should consider security, high availability and interoperability between vehicles. However, these are not easily achievable without a centralized service provider; it is difficult for an autonomous P2P system to guarantee data integrity, and it cannot compensate drivers that actively participate in the vehicular cloud. Fortunately, the many successes achieved in the field of crypto-currency raise the possibility of defining incentives that are necessary for a sustainable digital economy. In this paper, we propose autoCoin—an approach that aims to encourage smart vehicles to cooperate to create and exchange infotainment data securely under the assumption of rationality. We introduce a scalable blockchain architecture for autoCoin and a smart contract to exchange contents without third-parties using an off-chain technique.",Electronics,2021,citation

Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.",ACM Comput.

Information-centric networking (ICN) adopts the paradigm of separation of the identifier and locator. It is efficient in content distribution by supporting in-network caching and has the potential to satisfy the low latency requirement in 5G. Replica selection is a key problem to retrieving content in ICN. Prior research usually utilizes the nearest replica. However, using the nearest replica cannot guarantee the smallest content download delay. To exploit in-network caching better, we propose an enhanced replica selection approach, called ERS. ERS first uses a distance-constrained-based name resolution system to discover the nearby replicas. Then, the most appropriate replica is chosen according to a local state table that maintains the state of replica nodes within a limited domain. In addition to network distance and replica node load, ERS innovatively introduces the path congestion degree between requester and replica nodes to assist replica selection. With extensive simulations, the proposed approach shows better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of average content download delay. Finally, the overhead of the proposed method is analyzed.",Electronics,2021,citation

This strategy aims at benefits from the use of ICN-based routing while maintaining backward compatibility with IP-based services. In the long run, an ICN-based Internet architecture may emerge from the interconnection of these ICN-based islands. We assess the feasibility of this strategy by discussing the willingness of Internet stakeholders to adopt one particular IP-over-ICN implementation based on the Publish-Subscribe Internet Technologies (PURSUIT) for flow-based routing, multicast routing, and service routing. We suggest that the IP-over-PURSUIT solution offers viable mechanisms for IP interoperability and routing scalability as well as potential advantages in comparison to substitutes, including IP-based solutions, such as IPv6; Multiprotocol Level Switching; and hybrid ICN; as well as other IP-over-ICN implementations based on Content-Centric Networking. We indicate that triple play operators and micro-operators have a greater incentive to adopt IP-over-PURSUIT since they can maximize the utilization of the multicast and service routing, respectively. However, we argue that IP-over-PURSUIT requires new exterior inter-stakeholder interfaces for significant operator traffic to be delivered through its new and cost-efficient routing capabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of operator adoption. Finally, we suggest that the advent of an ICN-based Internet architecture might be delayed until Internet stakeholders can trustworthily delegate the delivery of valuable content and services via information-based exchange points.",Telecommun.

The size of the network in which academic video lectures are distributed, the content location dynamics and the popularity of the stored video lectures will determine which routing scheme must be selected.

In this article, we show how location prediction techniques can be used to provide an anchor-less mobility management solution in order to ensure seamless handover of the producer during real-time multimedia communication.

In this paper, we experimentally investigated the effects of cache attacks on blockchain based information-centric networks. We used the hyperledger fabric to implement the blockchains for small and medium-sized networks. We implemented cache attacks where the attacker target the cache with unpopular content, forcing the user to fetch the data from the web servers. We experimented with two different topologies (linear and mesh) and also considered two cache sizes at the nodes. Three cache replacement policies were used: Least Recently Used, Random, and First In First Out. The cache hit, time taken to get the data, and the number of hops to serve the request were obtained with real network traffic. On the hyperledger fabric framework, we implemented two types of requests and showed how the query delay, invoke delay, and update delay vary with time.

In ICN, cache memory is implemented at each router, and content items are routed in the network by using content name as the locator determining the destination. The caching strategy that determines the content to be cached at each router strongly affects the cache hit ratio and flow hop length, and it is important to efficiently utilize limited cache resources by avoiding duplicated caching of the same content among routers located closely. In this paper, we propose a spatially dispersed caching (SDC), which is a caching strategy dispersing content by assigning a binary ID to each router and limiting the cache targets at each router to content with names whose hash value coincides with the router ID. Through computer simulations using backbone networks of actual ISPs in the United States, we show that the SDC improves the cache hit ratio by about 30%–170% compared with the case when caching content at all routers on the default path, and the SDC reduces the average hop length at cache hit by about 50%–90% compared with the existing caching strategies. Moreover, we show that the SDC improves the sustainable ratio of content acquisition in large-scale failures of routers by about 25%–200% compared with the existing caching strategies.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2019,citation

In BDLP, a special type of node, a data dam blockchain node, is designed to locally control registration and restrict data flow, besides the function of a blockchain node.

This will improve the efficient distribution of the future Internet of Things (IoT) media content and allow nodes communication based on content names. End users can obtain content from any intermediate caches which possess difficulties in securing data cached. Therefore, the ability for self-contained protection is paramount. A ciphertext-policy attribute base encryption (CP-ABE) scheme had been identified as a preferable solution. To achieve an efficient performance of CP-ABE scheme, we exploited access tree representation of access structure which defines access policy and modified it into a unique CP-ABE scheme based on the reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD), and proposed an efficient non-monotonic ROBDD CP-ABE scheme for IoT CCN. The size of the key is not affected by the number of users. The ROBDD legitimate path is used to determine the size of the ciphertext instead of the number of the nodes. This scheme has a high decryption stage and offers resistance to collision attack. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is based on the efficiency of the ROBDD. In accordance with performance analysis, ROBDD CP-ABE scheme achieves a high efficiency as compared to the existing CP-ABE schemes.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2019,citation

This paper considers the problem of multiple forwarding strategies against different topologies. We design seven topologies with different connectivity in order to compare the performance of the different forwarding strategies under diverse network topologies and results shows that the influence of connectivity on multiple forwarding strategies is rather different. The strategy NCC maintained higher drop rate than multicast until connectivity is up to 0.3 and the delay of diverse forwarding strategy was different from each other when it came to connectivity. Besides, we innovatively develop a hybrid multi-strategy selection scheme in NDN which sustains routers in the same network adopting different forwarding strategies.

By opportunistically caching content within the network, CCN appears to be well-suited for a large-scale content distribution and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications that dominate today’s Internet. To provide content authentication, CCN dictates that each content object must be digitally signed by its respective producer. All entities (consumers and routers) must, in principle, verify the content signature before processing it. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification, key retrieval, and potential certificate chain traversal; and (2) lack of trust context, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify the content signature. This renders signature verification impractical in routers, opening the door for the so-called content poisoning attacks. We study the root causes of the content poisoning attacks and reach the conclusion that meaningful mitigation of content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management architecture. We propose two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic, that allow routers to detect fake (aka “poisoned”) content objects. The usages of each approach depend on the location and role of routers in the network, as well as their computational capabilities.",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2019,citation

Therefore, novel proposals for the future Internet architecture are researched, as Information Centric Networks (ICN). ICN tries to shape the Internet architecture to the current Internet challenges by moving from the host-to-host model to a content-centric substitute. The survey on the related work shows how the routing techniques proposed to solve this subject take quite contrasting directions, from a deterministic link-state to a broadcast system. The literature review provides signs suggesting that Name Data Networking, a research project under ICN, might be able to adopt a swarm technique for the routing and forwarding planes due to the similarities between both concepts. Therefore, these techniques are thoroughly studied to present a design proposal implementing them, which applies the features from an antbased system and complies with the NDN architecture. The system that evaluates the design is a simulator, implemented by means of several iterations of design implementation. The gathering of data comes from different experiments over two distinct topologies. The results certify the correct behavior of the system, operating as it is expected, and providing with interesting results. Moreover, the comparison between a flooding system with the ant-based design establishes a more fruitful outcome for the later in terms of content retrieved and path length. The contribution done by this Thesis is to provide an alternative with promising results to the currently employed routing techniques in the NDN field. hopefully, the solution presented may support further work in this line of research.",,2019,citation

In the first category, our discussion centers around virtualization and reprogrammability at the sensing layer. In the second category, we investigate the readiness of Fog computing and information-centric networking to develop scalable personalized IoT infrastructures. These approaches were chosen for their combined ability to match dynamic user requirements with available system resources, while guaranteeing overall efficient utilization.

CCN has attracted attention in the research community as a means to cope with the increasing rate of Internet traffic. The host-to-host architecture is demonstrated to be inefficient in content distribution with a lot of bandwidth waste, and it is intricate to set up the network service because of the TCP/IPs location-dependence. CCN is a future Internet architecture which is directed to disentangle the above problems by location-independent content naming and world-wide content caching in a content router. An efficient caching is essential to reduce the delay and to enhance the performance of the network. In addition, a good cache replacement scheme is also necessary to decide which content should reside in the cache and which one should be evicted. The traditional caching replacement strategies schemes such as FIFO, LRU and MRU etc. are not updated as adaption of CCN from host-to-host Internet architecture. Before making replacement, a replacement strategy must performs the calculation of popularity of a content, local popularity of a content (intra-domain network), expected probability respective of demand for a content and instantaneous hit ratio. The traditional and existing popularity based cache replacement strategies do not consider mentioned key points. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel popularity based content eviction scheme for CCN with evaluation of local popularity of a content using the betweenness-centrality concept.

Ainsi, cette these a pour objectif d’etudier et de lever les principaux verrous technologiques empechant l’adoption du protocole NDN (Name Data Networking) par les operateur en garantissant la securite, les performances, l’interoperabilite, la bonne gestion et le deploiement automatise d’un reseau NDN. Dans un premier temps, nous evaluons les performances actuelles d’un reseau NDN a l’aide d’un outil de notre conception, ndnperf, et constatons le cout eleve pour un serveur utilisant ce protocole. Puis nous proposons un ensemble de solutions pour ameliorer l’efficacite d’un serveur NDN pouvant etre jusqu’a 6,4 fois plus efficient que les parametres de base. Ensuite nous nous interessons a la securite de NDN a travers l’evaluation de l’attaque par empoisonnement de contenus, connue pour etre critique mais jamais caracterisee. Cette etude se base sur deux scenarios, en utilisant un serveur et un client pour effectuer la pollution, ou en exploitant une faille dans le traitement des paquets au niveau du routeur. Nous montrons ainsi la dangerosite de l’attaque et proposons une correction de la faille la permettant. Dans un troisieme temps, nous cherchons a adapter le protocole HTTP pour qu’il puisse etre transporte sur un reseau NDN a des fins d’interoperabilite. Pour ce faire, nous avons developpe deux passerelles qui effectuent les conversions necessaires pour qu’un contenu web puisse rentrer ou sortir d’un reseau NDN.

Some of the current solutions are based on the traditional encryption technology, but these solutions introduce significant overhead in the client side and have a high requirement to the memory and computing power of end user. In this paper, we use an efficient proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme in ICN framework to help reduce the overhead on the user-side while guaranteeing flexible data sharing between subscribers and even their cooperator. Our proposal has the additional benefits of a non-interactivity and collusion resistance.

CRoS-NDN supports content mobility and provides fast content recovery from copies that do not belong to the consumer-producer path because it splits identity from location without incurring FIB size explosion or supposing prefix aggregation. It provides features similar to Content Distribution Networks (CDN) in NDN, and improves the routing efficiency. We compare our proposal with similar routing protocols and derive analytical expressions for lower-bound efficiency and upper-bound latency. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate results in data delivery efficiency and delay.

This has emerged from the proliferation of intelligent Internet of Things devices and corresponding volumes of data being generated by these devices. This data explosion is not just an increase in the sheer volume of the data. Data flows are dramatically different, with machines creating and consuming the data like never before. In addition, connectivity to the network is often heterogeneous and opportunistic. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the universally-accepted networking protocol that has served us very well, transforming networks into the age of information. However, IP was designed with the sole purpose of connecting two machines over a fixed wired network. The requirements for the network when IP was designed were vastly different from the requirements we now have. Demand for heterogeneous content is rising sharply and more efficient content distribution is required to manage the corresponding traffic, and return requested content with acceptable Quality of Service (QoS). QoS provisioning and fulfilment is dependent on content recognition, which is not supported natively in IP host-centric networks. In IP,overlay mechanisms are used to capture content information to be used for QoS fulfilment,but this approach is inefficient given current network requirements. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) provides content-based delivery, but QoS concerns are not sufficiently addressed. The vehicular application domain is used in this work as an exemplar of one with complex networking requirements. Modern vehicles include significant technology that could be exploited to improve safety and road efficiency, but making use of these technologies requires time-sensitive information delivery between vehicles. The capabilities of the network are of critical importance to provide the required quality of service of data delivery. This thesis presents a QoS-aware Information-Centric Network for vehicular applications. In particular, the work extends the Named-Data Network (NDN), a variant of ICN, focusing on data delivery deadline awareness. The new algorithms classify the priority of requests, with associated QoS requirements by encoding QoS information into the interest request packets and corresponding data reply packets, and extending the routing algorithm to use multihop forwarding to efficiently request and receive the requested content without prebuilding routes. The work also explores extending network traffic control mechanisms at the data link layer, to assess the potential impact on network congestion management. Evaluations have been carried out using extensive simulation, in particular using a combination of the ndnSIM and SUMO simulators. Deadline aware success rate and packet success rate are both measured under different network densities, vehicle speeds, proportions of vehicles in the environment acting as content producers, and experiment durations. The QoS-aware ICN algorithms are assessed against four…",,2019,citation

In this paper, we propose novel forwarding, caching and routing approaches for NDN based on SDN (FCR-NS). In fact, we introduce a new NDN architecture, based on the SDN paradigm and on a routing protocol totally managed by SDN controller. In our solution, we use the new cache replacement policy, which calculates the popularity of local data in the switches, and the bloom filter structure, in order to make the forwarding strategy very fast. Our architecture is completely free from the current Internet architecture and uses only NDN messages. Thereby, it offers a complete separation between the control and data planes as it is based on the SDN network.

This has precipitated the need for an information-centric Internet architecture. Research in information-centric networks (ICNs) have resulted in novel architectures, e.g., CCN/NDN, DONA, and PSIRP/PURSUIT; all agree on named data based addressing and pervasive caching as integral design components. With network-wide content caching, enforcement of content access control policies become non-trivial. Each caching node in the network needs to enforce access control policies with the help of the content provider. This becomes inefficient and prone to unbounded latencies especially during provider outages. In this paper, we propose an efficient access control framework for ICN, which allows legitimate users to access and use the cached content directly, and does not require verification/authentication by an online provider authentication server or the content serving router. This framework would help reduce the impact of system down-time from server outages and reduce delivery latency by leveraging caching while guaranteeing access only to legitimate users. Experimental/simulation results demonstrate the suitability of this scheme for all users, but particularly for mobile users, especially in terms of the security and latency overheads.",IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2019,citation

However, some of the approaches support only content consumer, while content producer mobility faces many challenges, such as unnecessary Interest packet losses, high handoff latency, scalability issues, and high signaling overhead. Therefore, many approaches, protocols, and schemes were proposed to address the problem. The schemes such as indirection-based approach, locator-based approach, rendezvous-based, forwarding-based, and control/data plane-based, and mapping-based approach were investigated using either analytical or simulation investigation. However, in many cases of the formulation of an analytical investigation for information-centric networking mobility support management, the determination and incorporation of producers’ movement behavior are neglected, whereas the movement pattern of mobile content producer plays a vital role in mobility performance analysis of the wireless mobile network. This paper proposed a producer mobility management model for information-centric networking with a random waypoint and random walk mobility model incorporated, to measure the movement pattern effect and proved the uniformity of the proposed model to support any kind of mobility support approaches or schemes. The performance analysis result of our proposed model revealed that movement pattern does affect the mobile producer handoff performance.

With the expected connection among several tens of billions of addressable mobile devices and the exchange of a huge amount of content, the Internet and mobile communication are entering a new era that inevitably faces several challenges, especially from a content dissemination perspective. It has been exposed to many limitations such as high control overhead, frequent location updates, and network congestion. To resolve such limitations, this paper proposes an efficient hierarchical routing and content retrieval mechanism, which is called Hierarchical Routing (H-Routing) for the wireless network based on Content-Centric Networking (CCN). The H-Routing is composed of a novel content discovery approach and a common service platform for generic communications and the integration of heterogeneous devices. The proposed mechanism uses CCN and Chord-like lookup in a hierarchical M2M system in the wireless mobile environment. The H-Routing mechanism reduces unnecessary flooding of content request messages, control overhead, and the waste of resources. We also implemented the proposed mechanism in the simulation environment and analyze the performance in terms of throughput, Interest packet overhead, and Interest error ratio.

We conceptualize a namespace management system for hierarchical names and introduce a prototype for NDN, which leverages existing DNSSEC equipped DNS infrastructure. Based on this, we are able to implement both technical and non-technical aspects of namespace management.

However, the existing researches generally decide whether cache the data or replace it rely on local content popularity on each single node. It will cause different nodes caching the same data and result in unnecessary cache redundancy. In this paper, we investigate the global optimal problem of cache placement for IoT. We first prove that finding the optimal data cache location from the whole network is an NP-hard problem, and propose a centralized algorithm to obtain the approximate global optimal solution based on the Lagrangian Heuristic Algorithm. Then, inspired by the Lagrangian relaxation, we transform the iteration procedure of finding the optimal cache location into local decisions of cache location selection and cache replacement, and we propose a distributed cache placement algorithm. Besides, the cache replacement algorithm can also be used to adjust the best cache location when the user requirement changes. Finally, we implement the distributed cache placement strategy in NDN. The experimental results show that the distributed caching strategy approximates the global optimal solution very well, and can save the network traffic by about 12.6% on average comparing with other caching strategies.",,2019,citation

The test framework of the nMANET approach allows reproducibility of experiments and validation of expected results based on analysis of experimental data. The area of application for nMANETs is the distribution of humanitarian information in emergency scenarios. Named-Data Networking (NDN) and ad-hoc mobile communication allow exchange of emergency information in situations where central services such as cellular towers and electric systems are disrupted. The implemented prototype enables researchers to reproduce experiments on content distribution that consider constraints on mobile resources, such as the remaining power of mobile devices and available network bandwidth. The nMANET framework validates a set of experiments by measuring network traffic and energy consumption from both real mobile devices and those in a simulated environment. Additionally, this thesis presents results from experiments in which the nMANET forwarding strategies and traditional wireless services, such as hotpost, are analysed and compared. This experimental data represents the evidence that supports and validates the methodology presented in this thesis. The design and implementation of an nMANET prototype, the Java NDN Forwarder Daemon (JNFD) is presented as a testing framework, which follows the principles of continuous integration, continuous testing and continuous deployment. This testing framework is used to validate JNFD and IP-based technologies, such as HTTP in a MANET using the OLSR routing protocol, as well as traditional wireless infrastructure mode wireless. The set of experiments executed, in a small network of Android smart-phones connected in ad-hoc mode and in a virtual ad-hoc network simulator show the advantages of reproducibility using nMANET features. JNFD is open source, all experiments are scripted, they are repeatable and scalable. Additionally, JNFD utilises real GPS traces to simulate mobility of nodes during experiments.

We have conducted a mathematical study of the system performance based on an asymmetric tree model in order to reduce content delivery delay. Forwarding strategy is one of the most important layers in NDN architecture and we present a new forwarding strategy named “Reduce Delay” in this work. We have included a Boolean variable IB (IFF boundary) to the default Interest packet. The value is False by default and is set to True once an Interest packet crosses the boundary and the nodes immediate outside (adjacent) the boundary stores a value against the Interest. Once the Interest packet hits the content sources, Data packet is replied back to the requester of the content if the source of the Data is inside the boundary. However, if the source is outside the boundary Data packet travels up to the adjacent nodes only from where an Offer packet is sent to the requester. This strategy saves the discovery time a lot more than the existing scheme as it stores or brings the Data closer to the requester. We have performed mathematical model based analysis and case studies to show the performance of our scheme in compared to the default and existing schemes.","2019 International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Engineering (ECCE)",2019,citation

VANETs enable vehicular communications and support the deployment of more intelligent, secure, efficient, and pleasant transportation systems. NDN focus on named content and does not use IP addresses. NDN relies on innetwork and decentralized caching to provide content redundancy within networks, which is useful for optimizing network resource utilization and improve response time and content availability. In this way, NDN improves VANET application performance when compared to other communication techniques such as IP, which focus on hosts instead of content. This Ph.D. thesis proposes efficient solutions to address the negative effects of communication conditions induced by high vehicle mobility and wireless communications on VNDN application performance. Among the contributions, this thesis first proposes a new VNDN architecture and a geographic routing protocol to route VNDN messages between content sources and requesters. The proposed routing protocol also addresses the effects of well-known VANET problems such as broadcast storms, message redundancy and transmission resynchronization. Then, this thesis investigates the effects of content receiver/requester mobility in VNDN, and identifies the problem of Reverse Path Partitioning (RPP). To address RPP this thesis introduces Auxiliary Forwarding Set (AFS). AFS determines the RPP probability and when required chooses and extra set of eligible vehicles as candidates to forward message towards their destinations, as opposite to standard NDN where only the nodes that forwarded an Interest message forward the corresponding Data message. This thesis also investigates the problems caused by content source mobility and network partitions in VNDN. To address the content source mobility problem, this thesis applies the concept of Floating Content (FC). To address the network partition problem this thesis proposes two different solutions. For the cases where infrastructure support is available, content retrieval can be delegated to existing road-side units (RSUs) while for the cases of no infrastructure support the concept of store-carry-forward (SCF) is applied. As the last contribution, this thesis integrates all the solutions described above in a framework that supports VNDN communications with high performance in both highway and urban scenarios with variable vehicle densities. The evaluation results show that the solutions proposed in this thesis are efficient and scalable providing high VNDN application performance even in complex and highly mobile traffic scenarios.",,2018,citation

To stimulate cooperation between agents, we adopt a reputation and trust building scheme that is able to explicitly account for both objective current content availability and subjective willingness to cooperate. The scheme is further complemented with a so-called one-time goodwill mechanism introduced to avoid penalizing agents failures to provide temporarily unavailable content. In a simulated ICN environment under a modified Random Waypoint user mobility model, we investigate the resiliency of the reputation and trust building scheme to subversion, that is, strategic (selfish or malicious) agents acquiring higher trust values than honest ones, for varying user mobility scenarios. The scheme proves resilient in low-mobility scenarios, while increased user mobility is shown to have a negative effect. The one-time goodwill mechanism partly remedies this for high-mobility scenarios.

The content is out of its owner's control once it is published. Thus, enforcing access control policies on distributed content copies is crucial in ICN. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a feasible approach to enforce such control mechanisms in this environment. However, applying ABE in ICN faces two challenges: from management perspective, it is complicated to manage attributes in distributed manners; from privacy protection perspective, unlike in traditional networks, the enforced content access policies are public to all the ICN users. Thus, it is desirable that unauthorized content viewers are not able to retrieve the access policy.

The biggest concern of ISPs is related to their customers’ contents delivery speed. In this paper, we consider ICN caching locations in ISP by using the concept of locator/ID separation protocol (LISP) for interoperation between a traditional IP address and name-based ICN. To be more specific, we propose a new procedure to determine caching locations in the ICN by using the cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) for finding the best caching locations of information chunks.

These results have led to the development of micro-detector-based attack detection solutions leveraging hypothesis testing theory. The approach allows the design of an optimal (AUMP) test capable of providing a desired Probability of False Alarms (PFA) by maximizing the detection power. We have integrated these micro-detectors into a security monitoring plan to detect abnormal changes and correlate them through a Bayesian network, which can identify events impacting security in an NDN node. This proposal has been validated by simulation and experimentation on IFA and CPA attacks.",,2018,citation

On-path caching is a light-weight implementation of in-networking caching. Existing studies on on-path caching strategy are mainly confined to the local information and neglect the interaction between multi-node cache decisions, which incurs cache redundancy and lead to performance degradation. To this end, we analyze the relationship between multi-node decisions and propose a lightweight on-path cooperative caching strategy, called GAC. In GAC, caching decisions are divided into two phases. In the first round, the upstream node makes caching decision based on the downstream caching information. In the second round, according to the feedback from upstream nodes, each node is given an opportunity to optimize the caching decision it made before. We evaluate the performance of our scheme through extensive simulations regarding a wide range of performance metrics. The experimental results indicate GAC can achieve significant performance improvement compared with representative approaches in terms of server load reduction ratio, average hop reduction ratio and average cache hit ratio. Meanwhile, GAC can significantly reduce the number of cache evictions.",2018 IEEE 37th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC),2018,citation

In name-based routing, there is a tradeoff between the cost of name announcement and name lookup. Some ICN architectures introduce an efficient way of name lookup but pay high price in name announcement, others cut off most information exchange in name announcement yet introduce heavy burden in name lookup. In order to solve this problem and balance the cost of name announcement and lookup, we propose Name-based routing with On-Path Name Lookup (OPNL). OPNL looks up name prefixes on the path to name's guaranteed destination. It accomplishes distributed name lookup with lighter burden while maintaining little information exchange in name announcement. Results of simulation experiments show that OPNL makes a tradeoff between the cost of name announcement and lookup to have better scalability, eliminates storage overhead and communication overhead compared with prior works and attains even better performance.",2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2018,citation

ICN extensively uses universal in-network caching. However, developing an efficient caching scheme remains an open question. To overcome the useless caching and duplication caching of previous caching schemes, we propose an adaptive caching scheme—caching on demand (COD). By following the change in potential demand from the consumer and the temporal patterns of content popularity, COD allows content to be cached only by some necessary nodes instead of all nodes on the path from content provider to content consumer. At the same time, in accordance with trading off bandwidth for cache (bandwidth-for-cache), content can be pushed to the adjacent node with more cache capacity. We present a theoretical model to evaluate cache usage for COD. Finally, we evaluate COD through extensive experiments and a wide range of performance metrics. The experimental results under diverse setting demonstrate that COD can yield a steady improvement of network performance and caching efficiency compared with CEE, EgoBetw and Probcache. Notably, COD improves performance with negligible overhead.",Telecommun. Syst.,2018,citation

However, state-of-the-art caching mechanisms in literature are mostly bounded by application scenarios. With the rapid development of heterogeneous networks, the lack of uniform caching management has become an issue. Therefore, a novel caching mechanism, Semi-Edge caching (SE), is proposed in this paper. SE caching mechanism is based on in-network caching technique and it could be generically applied into various types of network fog. Furthermore, two content allocation strategies, SE-U (unicast) and SE-B (broadcast), are proposed within SE mechanism. The performance of SE-U and SE-B are evaluated in three typical topologies with various scenario contexts.

In this paper, we present a lightweight approach to mitigate content poisoning by clearing bogus Data packets in cache store and help network to adjust forwarding paths to retrieve legitimate Data packets. The proposed scheme can block the evil producer and protect the legitimate producer at the same time.

In this paper, we formulate the content placement problem and propose a distributed probabilistic caching strategy to enhance cache efficiency. Each node makes cache decision individually and caches passing content with certain probability, which is proportional to content popularity and content placement benefit. As a component of our scheme, we also propose an accurate method to predict the variations of content popularity. Besides, a global-popularity-based caching scheme is proposed to be used as a benchmark for performance evaluation. We conduct extensive simulations based on ndnSIM and evaluate our scheme on tree, intra-AS, and inter-AS topologies. Results indicate it outperforms the state-of-art schemes in terms of cache hit ratio, access latency, cache operation cost, and link bandwidth savings. It can achieve dramatic performance improvement, even in the case of a small cache size. In particular, the reduction of caching operation can reach up to two orders of magnitude. We also examine the impacts of various replacement policies on cache performance and perform overhead analysis.

However, due to the overall magnitude and harsh characteristics of underwater environments, standard wireless network techniques will fail because current technology and energy restrictions limit underwater devices due to delayed acoustic communications. To help manage these limitations we utilize Information-Centric Networking (ICN). More importantly, we look at ICN’s paradigm shift from traditional TCP/IP architecture to improve data handling and enhance network efficiency. By utilizing some of ICN’s techniques, such as data naming hierarchy, we can reevaluate each component of the network’s protocol stack given current underwater limitations to study the vast solutions and perspectives Information-Centric architectures can provide to UANs. First, we propose a routing strategy used to manage and route large data files in a network prone to high mobility. Therefore, due to UANs limited transmitting capability, we passively store sensed data and adaptively find the best path. Furthermore, we introduce adapted Named Data Networking (NDN) components to improve upon routing robustness and adaptiveness. Beyond naming data, we use tracers to assist in tracking stored data locations without using other excess means such as flooding. By collaborating tracer consistency Robert Martin, University of Connecticut, 2018 with routing path awareness our protocol can adaptively manage faulty or high mobility nodes. Through this incorporation of varied NDN techniques, we are able to see notable improvements in routing efficiency. Second, we analyze the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on upper layer protocols. Since UANs are typically resource restrained, malicious users can advantageously create fake traffic to burden the already constrained network. While ICN techniques only provide basic DoS restriction we must expand our detection and restriction technique to meet the unique demands of UANs. To provide enhanced security against DoS we construct an algorithm to detect and restrict against these types of attacks while adapting to meet acoustic characteristics. To better extend this work we incorporate three node behavior techniques using probabilistic, adaptive, and predictive approaches for detecting malicious traits. Thirdly, to depict and test protocols in UANs, simulators are commonly used due to their accessibility and controlled testing aspects. For this section, we review Aqua-Sim, a discrete event-driven open-source underwater simulator. To enhance the core aspect of this simulator we first rewrite the current architecture and transition Aqua-Sim to the newest core simulator, NS-3. Following this, we clean up redundant features spread out between the various underwater layers. Additionally, we fully integrate the diverse NS-3 API within our simulator. By revamping previous code layout we are able to improve architecture modularity and child class expandability. New features are also introduced including localization and synchronization support, busy terminal problem support, multi-channel support, transmission range uncertainty modules, external noise generators, channel trace-driven support, security module, and an adapted NDN module. Additionally, we provide extended documentation to assist in user development. Simulation testing shows improved memory management and continuous validity in comparison to other underwater simulators and past iterations of Aqua-Sim.

At the same time, there is a trend in deploying In-Network Computing Resources (INCRs) closer to end users either in the form of network equipment, with capabilities of performing general-purpose computations, and/or in the form of commercial off-the-self “data centres in a box”, i.e., cloudlets, placed at different locations of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). That is, INCRs extend cloud computing at the edge and middle-tier locations of the network, providing significantly smaller response times than those achieved by the current “client-to-cloud” network model. In this thesis, we argue about the necessity of exploiting INCRs for application provisioning with the purpose of improving LLAs’ Quality of Service (QoS) by essentially deploying applications closer to end users. To this end, this thesis investigates the deployment of LLAs over INCRs under fixed, mobile, and disrupted user connectivity environments. In order to fully reap the benefits of INCRs, we develop for each connectivity scenario algorithmic frameworks that are centred around the concept of a market, where LLAs lease existing INCRs. The proposed frameworks take into account the particular characteristics of INCRs, such as their limited capacity in hosting application instances, and LLAs, by addressing the number of instances each application should deploy at each computing resource over time. Furthermore, since typically the smooth operation of network applications is supported by Network Functions, such as load balancers, firewalls etc., we consider the deployment of complementary Virtual Network Functions for backing LLAs’ provisioning over INCRs. Overall, the key goal of this thesis is the investigation of using an enhanced Internet through INCRs as the communication platform for LLAs.",,2018,citation

Moreover, existing works just focus on centralized cache configuration, which causes low efficiency and high latency. To address aforementioned challenges, we propose an on-demand fog caching service for ICN, named FogCache, which is realized by perceiving synthetical content popularity, traffic and time cost, and node importance. Regional fog nodes are adapted to configure caching service at the edge of ICN, in which the additional complexity is low because just minimal byte information is added at the end of the data packets.

Such systems are driving innovative applications and services that improve the quality of life of citizens both socially and economically. Furthermore, autonomic communication, because of its decentralised approach to communication, is also being explored by the research community as an alternative to centralised control infrastructures for efficient management of large networks. This thesis studies one of the successful contributions in the autonomic communication research, the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN). CPN is a highly scalable adaptive routing protocol that allows for decentralised control in communication. Consequently, CPN has achieved significant successes, and because of the direction of research, we expect it to continue to find relevance. To investigate this hypothesis, we research new applications and contexts for CPN. This thesis first studies Information-Centric Networking (ICN), a future Internet architecture proposal. ICN adopts a data-centric approach such that contents are directly addressable at the network level and in-network caching is easily supported. An optimal caching strategy for an information-centric network is first analysed, and approximate solutions are developed and evaluated. Furthermore, a CPN inspired forwarding strategy for directing requests in such a way that exploits the in-network caching capability of ICN is proposed. The proposed strategy is evaluated via discrete event simulations and shown to be more effective in its search for local cache hits compared to the conventional methods.

In NDN Consumers issue Interests for Contents. Producers generate a content in response to each received interest and such content is routed back to the requesting consumer. When compared to IP, NDN brings advantages such as better throughput and lower latency, because routers are able to cache popular contents and satisfy interests for such contents locally. However, before being considered a viable approach, NDN should offer security services that are ideally better, but at least equivalent to current mechanisms in IP.In this regard, mechanisms to prevent DDoS are of paramount importance. In this work we propose FROG: a simple yet effective Interest Flooding Attack (IFA) detection and mitigation method. FROG runs on routers that are directly connected to NDN consumers and monitors packet hop counts.

One crucial problem in ICN is to design routing and forwarding strategy so that traffic can be transmitted efficiently even with the dynamics of network link. In this paper, we consider content centric network (CCN), which is one of the promising candidate architecture design for ICN. Particularly, we consider the scalable CCN with name mapping system, which improves scalability by using router Identifier as name prefix to forward interests. We address the issue of improving link failure resiliency for CCN by designing a dynamic interest transmission approach. We propose the link failure resilient interest transmission algorithm (LFRIT) to enhance link failure resiliency by considering both network traffic and link status information. Additionally, we propose the advanced design of LFRIT (A-LFRIT), which calculates and updates the forwarding table centrally for link updates to further improve network robustness. Numerous simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach under realistic network topologies with respect to packet loss, latency, and network link utilization. Simulation results demonstrate that the packet loss probability and data retrieval delay of A-LFRIT can reduce to 50% of the basic CCN and multi-repository single path approaches.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2018,citation

To this end, content centric networking (CCN) as one of the most effective architectures has been proposed with significant features of in-network caching to open new possibilities for energy efficiency in content dissemination. However in energy-efficient CCN, less popular contents are cached near the origin server, and therefore in delay sensitive applications with less popularity, it leads to dropping delayed chunks, increasing energy waste, and degrading the quality of service (QoS). In the present paper, the energy consumption in CCN while being aware of QoS consideration in terms of imposed delay is minimized. The minimization is performed through integer linear programming by considering most of the energy consuming components. However, since this problem is NP-hard, a quantized Hopfield neural network with an augmented Lagrange multiplier method (MEDCCN-QHN) is proposed to derive the solution. The numerical results show that the MEDCCN-QHN achieves to better delay profile compared to the optimal energy-efficient algorithm, and near-optimal energy consumption. Moreover, the method is fast due to its parallel execution capability.",Journal of Network and Systems Management,2018,citation

For example, streamed video is viewed and shared more than ever on mobile devices, bandwidth requirements rise to support standards with superior qualities like 4K and HDR, and worldwide service offerings come with diverse network environments to handle. 
 
Driven by these challenges, this dissertation presents research with the central goal to measurably improve users’ Quality of Experience in current and future video applications on the Internet. We present findings in integral parts of video streaming applications, comprising adaptive live mobile broadcasting and video on demand use cases within three integrative research areas. 
 
In our first contribution, we initially present results of a measurement study on live mobile video broadcasting services that show the video upload quality to be particularly impaired when mobile connections are used. For the automatic composition of live video, the quality of such mobile broadcasts are a prerequisite for achieving a high user satisfaction by switching between the best available content from multiple sources. However, the current approach to upload all available live user-generated video streams for mobile video composition leads to a high overhead on mobile devices. Our work presents a new method based on device context measurements that allows to drastically improve efficiency in such automatic video composition systems by identifying the relevant quality indicators on the device based on derived sensor and network measurements. We achieve an improved Quality of Experience with our proposed context-based stream selection method as verified in a field test and a crowd-sourced user study. 
 
Next, in the context of the distribution of video on demand content using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), we show that strong potential lies in investigating the cross-layer configuration space of video streaming systems, given the wide range of interdependent system aspects, environments, and service requirements as opposed to state-of-the-art research that focuses on single system aspects such as adaptation algorithms. By generating a broad set of experiments, i. e., covering a wide spectrum of cross-layer DASH video streaming system configuration parameters, we identify such performance aspects related to, e. g., the TCP congestion control, adaptation algorithms, and DASH players within heterogeneous network environments. We show that a subset of concrete configurations can improve DASH user experience in video on demand applications, and further motivate transitions of such DASH mechanisms based on learned sweet spot configurations. 
 
Last, we envision that in the long term, more fundamental changes to the underlying network infrastructure of the Internet need to be considered for addressing the demands of developing video streaming systems by investigation of adaptive video distribution in Named Data Networks (NDNs). First, we show that the naive application of established concepts in DASH adaptation algorithms, that use buffer or segment throughput measurements as input, lead to unfavorable results given substantial differences in the network behavior of NDN. Our proposed concept for adaptation algorithms in NDNs is based on an improved network throughput measurement method and is shown to reduce stalling and increase streaming bitrates as compared to approaches used in current DASH adaptation algorithms. 
 
Overall, this dissertation provides the following contributions: i) first, a detailed emulation-based analysis and comparison of today’s DASH system implementations and algorithms, ii) novel concepts to enable efficient live mobile video composition, iii) and last, significant improvements in the performance for adaptive video streaming systems with the emerging NDN paradigm.",,2018,citation

Even though there have been simulation studies related to denial of service and cache attacks, studies of attacks on real networks are still lacking in the research. In this thesis, the effects of cache attacks in real information-centric networking systems were investigated. Cache attacks were implemented in real networks with different cache sizes and with Least Recently Used, Random and First In First Out algorithms to fill the caches in each node. The attacker hits the cache with unpopular content, making the user request that the results be fetched from web servers. The cache hit, time taken to get the result, and number of hops to serve the request were calculated with real network traffic.

But this feature opens a gate for the attacker to access the cache and determine recent cache access pattern. An attacker can probe request and determine if the received content is cached or not by observing time difference between the request and data received. Previous solutions try to apply delay whenever the data is accessed from the cache. These approaches mitigate attack but compromise NDN performance. To overcome this issue, we have proposed a counter scheme in which the gateway router detects attack pattern and applies countermeasure. Our approach applies delay on data accessed from the cache, only when the attack is detected. We have compared our approach with the approach in which random delay is applied every time on cache hit. Our approach is better than random delay approach in terms of average delay.",2018 IEEE/ACIS 17th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS),2018,citation

With the emerging IoT applications, in which a content data may have multiple producers, the content name resolution needs to incorporate the producer selection based on the user’s criteria or proactively into the system. The currently existing name resolution approaches in ICN have two major categories: the name based routing approach that combines the name resolution and routing of content request as one process and the standalone approach that separates from the routing of the content request. Both categories of approaches do not work well for the new producer selection feature. The paper proposes a hybrid name resolution approach, in which each content has a Home Node located in ICN routers. The Home Node maintains all the necessary information for producer selection while acts as the virtual content producer to the rest of the network. A classification model is introduced to determine how a Home Node is specified for a newly published content. The paper compares the new approach with the existing ones in the performances of control message overhead and latency. The proposed approach outperforms in different settings of simulations.","2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)",2018,citation

We model cache placement with the help of stochastic geometry and optimize the allocation of storage capacity among files in order to minimize the cache miss probability. We consider both per cache capacity constraints as well as an average capacity constraint over all caches. The case of per cache capacity constraints can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming, whereas the case of the average constraint leads to a convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that the average constraint leads to significantly smaller cache miss probability. Finally, we suggest a simple LRU-based policy for geographically distributed caching and show that its performance is close to the optimal.",,2018,citation

In ICN, cache memory is implemented at each router, and content items are routed in the network by using the content name as the locator determining the destination. The caching strategy that determines the content to be cached at each router strongly affects the cache hit ratio and flow hop length, and it is important to efficiently utilize limited cache resources by avoiding duplicated caching of the same content among routers located closely. However, no caching strategy aiming at dispersing content over networks has been investigated. In this paper, we propose spatially dispersed caching (SDC), which is a caching strategy dispersing content by assigning a binary ID to each router and limiting the cache targets at each router to content with names whose hash value coincides with the router ID. Through computer simulations using backbone networks of actual ISPs in the USA, we show that SDC reduced the average hop length by about 5% to 20% compared with the existing caching strategies.",2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2018,citation

In these architectures, routing nodes have caching functionality that can influence the network traffic and communication quality since the data items can be sent from nodes far closer to the requesting users. Therefore, realizing effective caching networks becomes important to grasp the cache characteristics of each node and to manage system resources, taking into account networking metrics (e.g., higher hit ratio) as well as user’s metrics (e.g. shorter delay). This thesis studies the methodologies for improving the performance of cache management in ICNs. As individual sub-problems, this thesis investigates the LRU-2 and 2-LRU algorithms, geographical locality in distribution of users’ requests and efficient caching in ICNs. As the first contribution of this thesis, a mathematical model to approximate the behaviour of the LRU2 algorithm is proposed. Then, 2-LRU and LRU-2 cache replacement algorithms are analyzed. The 2LRU caching strategy has been shown to outperform LRU. The main idea behind 2-LRU and LRU-2 is considering both frequency (i.e. metric used in LFU) and recency (i.e. metric used in LRU) together for cache replacement process. The simulation as well as numeric results show that the proposed LRU-2 model precisely approximates the miss rate for LRU-2 algorithm. Next, the influence of geographical locality in users’ requests on the performance of network of caches is investigated. Geographically localized and global request patterns have both been observed to possess Zipf (i.e. a power-law distribution in which few data items have high request frequencies while most of data items have low request frequencies) properties, although the local distributions are poorly correlated with the global distribution. This suggests that several independent Zipf distributions combine to form an emergent Zipf distribution in real client request scenarios. An algorithm is proposed that can generate realistic synthetic traffic to regional caches that possesses Zipf properties as well as produces a global Zipf distribution. The simulation results show that the caching performance could have different behaviour based on what distribution the users’ requests follow. Finally, the efficiency of cache replacement and replication algorithms in ICNs are studied since ICN literature still lacks an empirical and analytical deep understanding of benefits brought by in-network caching. An analytical model is proposed that optimally distributes a total cache budget among the nodes of ICN networks for LRU cache replacement and LCE cache replication algorithms. The results will show how much user-centric and system-centric benefits could be gained through the in-network caching compared to the benefits obtained through caching facilities provided only at the edge of the network.",,2018,citation

The forwarding priorities of the matching interfaces are updated according to the network status by controllers. The Interest packet is forwarded through the matching interface with the highest forwarding priority. The SD-STAR mechanism also works under link or node failures.

The content is out of its owner's control once it is published. Thus, enforcing access control policies on distributed content copies is crucial in ICN. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a feasible approach to enforce such control mechanisms in this environment. However, applying ABE in ICN faces two challenges: from management perspective, it is complicated to manage attributes in distributed manners; from privacy protection perspective, unlike in traditional networks, the enforced content access policies are public to all the ICN users. Thus, it is desirable that unauthorized content viewers are not able to retrieve the access policy.

The proposed system supports scalability, as the intersection property of a quorum system, inevitably minimizes the read/write operations overhead on distributed name resolution servers. Results show that the proposed technique increases the availability of the system along with low lookup overhead, latency, and load on distributed servers.",J. Univers. Comput. Sci.,2018,citation

Despite its wide usage, a thorough analysis on how scoped-flooding affects a network’s performance, e.g., caching and content discovery efficiency, is missing. To develop a better understanding, we first model the behavior of scoped-flooding by the help of a theoretical model on network growth and utility. Next, we investigate the effects of scoped-flooding on various topologies in information-centric networks (ICNs). Using the proposed ring model, we show that flooding can be constrained within a small neighborhood to achieve most of the gains which come from areas with relatively low growth rate, i.e., the network edge. We also study two flooding strategies and compare their behaviors. Given that caching schemes favor more popular items in competition for cache space, popular items are expected to be stored in diverse parts of the network compared to the less popular items. We propose to exploit the resulting divergence in availability along with the routers’ topological properties to fine tune the flooding radius. Our results shed light on designing both efficient content discovery mechanism and effective caching algorithms for future ICN.",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2018,citation

Its simplicity and universality have fueled the unprecedented and lasting global success of the current Internet. Nonetheless, some limitations of IP have been emerging in recent years. Furthermore, starting in mid-1990s, the advent of mobility, wirelessness, and the Web substantially shifted Internet usage and communication paradigms. This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet architecture and prompted interest in alternative designs. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters of efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures. As a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized “security and privacy by design” in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching and retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this end, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects were funded by the NSF in 2010: nebula, named-data networking, MobilityFirst, and expressive Internet architecture. This paper provides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy features (and issues) in these NSF-funded future Internet architectures. Prior surveys on future Internet architectures provide a limited, or even no, comparison on security and privacy features.

To cope with the challenges brought by the explosive growth of mobile traffic, mobile network operators tend to deploy and operate their own content distribution system within their existing network infrastructure. In this paper, we present a novel content distribution architecture called ISP-Controlled In-network Content Distribution (ICICD) to improve the content delivery performance in mobile network, which benefits from content request aggregation, hybrid cache decision mechanism, distributed load balancing, and seamless mobility support. Content request aggregation is used to decrease duplicate transmission. Hybrid cache decision mechanism enables the ICICD to cache content more efficiently. Distributed load balancing is able to ensure the overall performance and reliability of the content distribution architecture. Seamless mobility support function enables service continuity when mobile users move from one eNodeB to another. In this paper, we first give a detailed description about the key components of the ICICD architecture and then discuss a number of challenges in deploying the proposed ICICD architecture.

However, VCCN architecture faces many challenges including Consumer/Provider mobility, Flooding, Interest/Data packet forwarding, Forwarding selection and Congestion control. Consumer vehicle broadcasts (i.e., requests) the interest packet. Relay nodes vehicles receiving this interest packet and performs search (Content Storage, Pending Interest Table and Forward Interest Base) operations on it and then rebroadcasts the interest message in case of no content match. These search (Content Storage, Pending Interest Table, and Forward Interest Base) operations cause delay and duplication's of interest packets. In our paper, we propose a routing protocol scheme named Intersection Based Forwarder Selection (IBFS) to mitigate the interest broadcast storm and disconnected link within the network. In IBFS, each vehicle shares its trajectory information with its neighboring vehicles. All vehicles store/save trajectory information in its Neighbor Table (NT), which helps to select the best interest relay/forwarder vehicle on the basis of matching trajectory information with the consumer vehicle. We have also considered the other metrics i.e. velocity and hop count. IBFS protocol overcomes the end-to-end delay (low latency), ISD (Interest Satisfaction Delay), communication overheads and minimum number of interest forwarded with the reliable interest and data packet transmission.",2017 International Conference on Communication Technologies (ComTech),2017,citation

The social nature of today's networks' users (the term 'social' is used as a general technical term for network users with specific mutual relationships, and can address a large domain of users, including but not limited to social media users) has in turn a major influence on the networks' shapes and characteristics. On the other hand, with the emergence of advanced hardware and software technologies which enable significant processing power and storage space in mobile devices, and with their ever increasing widespread use, today's Internet is moving from an infrastructure-based network towards a wireless ad-hoc network. Besides, caching data within the network is going to be inevitable to improve latency and reduce bandwidth consumption, and storage is being considered as one of the network primitives.This research, thus, investigates the impact of the above aspects of today's networks on the performance. It first discusses and evaluates the effect of users' social behavior on the maximum achievable data rate in the wireless ad-hoc networks, and proves that social connection among nodes may actually help in scaling wireless networks. It also reveals that due to their different social status, various users have different effects on the performance, and therefore, traditional transport capacity concept for wireless networks is not appropriate for these types of networks. Second part of this work investigates the improvements in the fundamental limits of the performance metrics in networks of caches, and evaluates the effect of different caching policies and content searching algorithms on the obtained improvements. Then a framework is presented to quantify the overhead traffic of locating contents, and is later used to define some optimal policies with respect to the contents that should be cached for an operator-driven content distribution system. This framework can generally be used in many other distributed systems contexts where a control plane has to stay aware of the state of the forwarding plane.",,2017,citation

We also combined it with ProbCache placement scheme and compared it to conventional LRU scheme. We used evaluation metrics such as packet delay, hop count, cache hit rate and consumed energy.

It does not require NDN routers to change their routing tables (Forwarding Information Base) after a producer moves. Instead, the Interest packet can be sent from a consumer to the moved producer using the tunnel. The piggybacked Data packet which is sent back to the consumer will trigger the consumer to send the following Interest packets through the optimized path to the producer. Moreover, a naming scheme is proposed so that the NDN caching function can be fully utilized. An analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposal.

The subset of a content router must be selected in a manner such that maximum cache performance can be achieved. Motivated by this, we propose a Centrality-measures based algorithm (CMBA) for selection of an appropriate content router for caching of the contents. The Centrality-measures are based on the question: ”Who are the most important or central content router in the network for the caching of contents?”.

The main driving force behind vehicular networking is to increase safety, with several other applications exploiting this ecosystem for traffic efficiency and infotainment provision. The most prominent existing candidates for vehicular networking are based on dedicated short range communications (DSRC) and cellular (4G) communications. In addition, the maturity of cloud computing has accommodated the invasion of vehicular space with cloud-based services. Nevertheless, current architectures can not meet the latency requirements of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications in highly congested and mobile environments. The future trend of autonomous driving pushes current networking architectures further to their limits with hard real-time requirements. Vehicular networks in 5G have to address five major challenges that affect current architectures: congestion, mobility management, backhaul networking, air interface and security. As networking transforms from simple connectivity provision, to service and content provision, fog computing approaches with caching and pre-fetching improve significantly the performance of the networks. The cloudification of network resources through software defined networking (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV) principles, is another promising enabler for efficient vehicular networking in 5G.

The objectives are, among others, to enable efficient use of renewable energy resources, to ensure security of electricity supply and to support future energy market structures. This requires data exchange between various legacy and future applications in the smart grid. To facilitate this, a flexible communication platform is required. A central question of this work is what such a communication platform should look like. Concepts for resilient communication, integration of legacy and future smart grid applications, and secure communication over untrusted infrastructures are designed, evaluated and optimized using simulations, analysis and prototypes. In addition, the communication dynamics of a trading platform for the future retail energy market are analyzed, and smart meters and their communication components (smart meter gateways) are investigated as further important building blocks for the smart grid.",,2017,citation

The new architecture of information-centric networking (ICN) facilitates users to locate data targets by giving their data names without any information about host addresses. In-network caching is one of the prominent features in ICN, which allows network routers to cache data contents. In this paper, we emphasize the management of in-network cache storage, and this includes the mechanisms of cache replacement and cache replication. A new cost function is then proposed to evaluate each cache content and the least valuable content is evicted when cache is full. To increase cache utilization, a cooperative caching policy among neighboring routers is proposed. The proper network locations to cache data contents are also discussed in the paper. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed caching policy than some traditional caching polices.",,2017,citation

In SCN, the service is in the center of the architectural design. Current efforts of SCN focus on design enhancements and the derivation of new components providing new functionality. In this article, we present session support for services in SCN. Our design makes use of existing hierarchical naming schemes to specify sessions using unique session identifiers. Sessions are established through a two-way handshake, which allows both the service consumer and provider to exchange their generated unique session identifiers. We have implemented and evaluated our SCN service session support mechanism, which provides promising results.",2017 IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking) and Workshops,2017,citation

But it is still a great challenge to better utilize in-network caching of ICNs with low costs. In this paper, we propose a popularity-based neighborhood collaborative caching algorithm for ICNs. In the algorithm, in-network nodes track the popularity of contents, and a novel process is used for quick comparison of popularity in the algorithm. En-route and one-hop neighborhood nodes make caching decision collaboratively. Real-world topologies and different client placed scenes are used in the simulation experiments, and our algorithm performs better in terms of latency, cache hit ratio and path stretch compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms and ideal situations. The overhead and tradeoff of the algorithm on estimation of popularity and node interaction are also explored in details, and the proposed algorithm provides a practical choice for ICN caching decision strategy with its good performance and acceptable overhead.",2017 IEEE 36th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC),2017,citation

However, this new mechanism also brings serious privacy risks due to cache snooping attacks. One effective solution to this problem is random-cache, where the cache in a router randomly mimics a cache hit or a cache miss for each content request/probe. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using multiple random-caches to protect cache privacy in a multi-path ICN. We propose models for characterizing the privacy of multi-path ICNs with random-caches, and analyze two different attack scenarios: 1) prefix-based attacks and 2) suffix-based attacks. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous caches are considered. Our analysis shows that in a multi-path ICN an adversary can potentially gain more privacy information by adopting prefix-based attacks. Furthermore, heterogeneous caches provide much better privacy protection than homogeneous ones under both attacks. The effect of different parameters on the privacy of multi-path random-caches is further investigated, and the comparison with its single-path counterpart is carried out based on numerical evaluations. The analysis and results in this paper provide insights in designing and evaluating multi-path ICNs when we take privacy into consideration.",Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2017,citation

Από τη σκοπιά των χρηστών του, αποτελεί ένα παγκόσμιο μέσο για την ανταλλαγή αντικειμένων Πληροφορίας ανάμεσα σε εκατομμύρια σταθερούς καικινητούς χρήστες. Ωστόσο, η κληροδοτημένη από τα προηγούμενα χρόνια αρχιτεκτονικήτου Διαδικτύου, θέτει σοβαρούς περιορισμούς ή καθιστά ανεπαρκή τη διάθεση και την ανάκτηση της επιθυμητής Πληροφορίας. Πλέον αυτού, τόσο οι επεκτάσεις που εφαρμόστηκαν(εν είδει «μπαλώματος») στην υπάρχουσα αρχιτεκτονική με στόχο την υποστήριξη της κινητικότητας των χρηστών, όσο και η εγγενώς προσφερόμενη υποστήριξη της κινητικότηταςστην περίπτωση των αρχιτεκτονικών Πληροφοριοκεντρικής δικτύωσης (Information-Centric Networking (ICN)), δεν επαρκούν για να αντιμετωπίσουν τις σύγχρονες ανάγκες και απαιτήσεις σε όρους ποιότητας-της-υπηρεσίας (Quality-of-Service (QoS)) και επιθυμητού επιπέδου ποιότητας-της-εμπειρίας (Quality-of-Experience (QoE)) των χρηστών. Τα προβλήματα επιδεινώνονται από το καινοφανές και συνεχώς αυξανόμενο πλήθος των διαφορετικών αντικειμένων της Πληροφορίας και των κινητών συσκευών στο Διαδίκτυο, το οποίο συνεπάγεται υψηλά επίπεδα όγκου κίνησης δεδομένων, τόσο για τα αιτήματα επίλυσης ονομάτωνπεριεχομένου, όσο και για τη μετάδοση των ίδιων των αντικειμένων της Πληροφορίας. Η κύρια συνεισφορά της παρούσας διατριβής έγκειται στο σχεδιασμό μοντέλων αποδοτικής προληπτικής ενταμίευσης (efficient proactive caching) για την ενίσχυση της απρόσκοπτης κινητικότητας των χρηστών. Τα εν λόγω μοντέλα είναι εκτελέσιμα σε επίπεδοεφαρμογής οποιασδήποτε υποκείμενης αρχιτεκτονικής δικτύωσης. Πλέον αυτού, δύνανται να εκτελούνται και σε επίπεδο δικτύου στην περίπτωση των αρχιτεκτονικών Πληροφοριοκεντρικής δικτύωσης. Το βασικό μοντέλο που προτείνουμε, είναι το αποκεντρωμένο μοντέλο αποδοτικής προληπτικής ενταμίευσης βάσει της κινητικότητας (Effiecient Mobility-basedCaching (EMC)). Πιο συγκεκριμένα, το EMC έχει σχεδιαστεί για να προβαίνει σε αυτόνομες αποφάσεις για τη προληπτική λήψη και ενταμίευση των δεδομένων τοπικά εντός μικρώνκυψελών ασύρματης μετάδοσης (small cells), κάνοντας χρήση α) της πληροφορίας πρόβλεψης με βάση τη συνολική κινητικότητα (aggregated mobility) των χρηστών και β) ενός σχήματος δυναμικής τιμολόγησης με βάση τη συμφόρηση της μνήμης (dynamic cache congestion pricing scheme) του τοπικού ενταμιευτή. Το EMC έχει ως στόχο του τη βελτίωση της εξυπηρέτησης της ζήτησης για περιεχόμενο εξειδικευμένου ενδιαφέροντος (Niche contentdemand). Σε αντίθεση με άλλες λύσεις προληπτικής ενταμίευσης, οι οποίες επικεντρώνονται αποκλειστικά στα δημοφιλή αντικείμενα της Πληροφορίας, η ζήτηση για εξειδικευμένοπεριεχόμενο αναφέρεται σε λιγότερο δημοφιλές περιεχόμενο ή περιεχόμενο εξατομικευμένουενδιαφέροντος, το οποίο –ιδίως στη περίπτωση περιεχομένου τύπου βίντεο– αντιπροσωπεύει ένα σημαντικό τμήμα επί του συνόλου των αιτημάτων στο Διαδίκτυο, της τάξεως του 20-40% και με αυξητική τάση. Τέλος, πλέον του EMC προτείνουμε μια σειρά από επεκτάσεις στο βασικό μοντέλο αποφάσεων, οι οποίες συνδυάζουν τη πρόβλεψη της κινητικότητας των χρηστών με τη δημοφιλία (popularity) του αιτούμενου περιεχομένου, με καινοτόμο στοιχείο τη δυναμική εξισορρόπηση της επιρροής μεταξύ της πρόβλεψης της κίνησης των χρηστών και της δημοφιλίας των αντικειμένων. Βάσει ενδελεχών προσομοιώσεων για την αξιολόγηση της επίδοσης των μοντέλωνπου προτείνουμε, οι οποίες εξερευνούν διαφορετικά επίπεδα ζήτησης, συλλογές αντικειμένωντύπου βίντεο και διαφορετικά σενάρια κινητικότητας των χρηστών (π.χ., περίπατος ανθρώπων ή αυτοκίνηση), δείχνουμε ότι τα κέρδη από την πρόβλεψη της κινητικότητας μπορεί να είναι υψηλά. Παράλληλα, διαπιστώνουμε ότι τα κέρδη από τη κινητικότητα μπορεί να υπερβαίνουνεκείνα από την ενταμίευση με βάση μόνο τη δημοφιλία του περιεχομένου, υποδηλώνοντας έτσι ότι οι αποφάσεις του EMC είναι ικανές να προσαρμόζονται καλά στη τοπικότητα της δημοφιλίας στο χρόνο (temporal locality) λόγω της τοπικότητας και της μικρής χρονικής κλίμακας των μετρήσεων για τη πρόβλεψη της κινητικότητας των χρηστών. Επιπλέον, η απόδοση της λύσης μας μπορεί να βελτιωθεί περαιτέρω με την αντικατάσταση ήδη ενταμιευμένων δεδομένων με δεδομένα από μετέπειτα αιτήματα, υπό το κόστος μιας επιπρόσθετης υπολογιστικής επιβάρυνσης σε ό,τι αφορά τις αποφάσεις ενταμίευσης του μοντέλου.

However, the proposed solutions for the ICN architecture are associated with many complexities including pervasive caching in the Internet and incompatibility with legacy IP networks, so the deployment of ICN in real networks is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a backward-compatible ICN architecture to address the caching issue in particular. The key idea is implementing edge caching in ICN, using a coalition of end clients and edge servers. Our solution can be deployed in IP networks with HTTP requests. We performed a trace-driven simulation for analyzing peer-assisted information-centric networking (PICN) benefits using IRCache and Berkeley trace files. The results show that on average, PICN decreases the latency for 78% and increases the content retrieval speed for 69% compared with a direct download from the original Web servers. When comparing PICN with a solution based on central proxy servers, we show that the hit ratio obtained using a small cache size in each PICN client is almost 14% higher than the hit ratio obtained with a central proxy server using an unlimited cache storage.",IEEE Access,2017,citation

Though the permission for encoding/recoding content packets at producers and intermediate routers provides performance benefits, it also introduces additional security issues and disables existing security practices. In this paper, we fill the gap by analyzing new security challenges brought accordingly and proposing an Autonomous Systems (AS-s) based security mechanism for NC applications in CCN. It can not only guarantee the optimal performance of NC, but also offer the assurance for Integrity, Origin Authentication and Correctness of content packets, together with proving trustworthiness among border routers.

In this paper, we propose a multilayer multi-component hierarchical attribute-value naming scheme for wireless devices. It combines self-certifying names to achieve a standardized naming scheme, which is scalable, efficient, routable, and is secure by design. We use variable-length encoding method to represent hierarchical location names with prefix-labeling.

Content and client security, provenance, and identity privacy are intrinsic by design in the ICN paradigm as opposed to the current host centric paradigm where they have been instrumented as an after-thought. However, given its nascency, the ICN paradigm has several open security and privacy concerns. In this article, we survey the existing literature in security and privacy in ICN and present open questions. More specifically, we explore three broad areas: security threats, privacy risks, and access control enforcement mechanisms. We present the underlying principle of the existing works, discuss the drawbacks of the proposed approaches, and explore potential future research directions. In security, we review attack scenarios, such as denial of service, cache pollution, and content poisoning. In privacy, we discuss user privacy and anonymity, name and signature privacy, and content privacy. ICN’s feature of ubiquitous caching introduces a major challenge for access control enforcement that requires special attention. We review existing access control mechanisms including encryption-based, attributebased, session-based, and proxy re-encryption-based access control schemes.

These networked sensing systems are at the intersection of sensing, communication, control, and computing [16]. Such systems will have applications in numerous fields such as vehicular systems and transportation, medical and health care systems, smart homes and buildings, etc. The proliferation of such sensing systems will trigger an exponential increase in the computational devices that exchange data over existing network infrastructure. Transporting data at scale in such systems is a challenge [21] mainly due to the underlying network infrastructure which is still resource constrained and bandwidth-limited. Efforts have been made to improve the network infrastructure [5] [2] [15]. The focus of this thesis is to put forward information-centric strategies that optimize the data transport over existing network infrastructure. This thesis proposes four different information-centric strategies: (1) Strategy to minimize network congestion in a generic sensing system by estimating data with adaptive updates, (2) An adaptive information exchange strategy based on rate of change of state for static and mobile networks, (3) Spatio-temporal strategy that maintains spatial resolution by reducing redundant transmissions, (4) Proximity-dependent data transfer strategy to ensure most updated information in high-density regions. Each of these strategies is experimentally verified to optimize the data transport in their respective setting.",,2017,citation

At the same time, the majority of IoT applications are Information Centric by design: they target specific actions that are not related to any network node but can be provided by multiple resources within the system. In this perspective, the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, formulated to answer to Future Internet requirements, can natively and seamlessly support IoT technologies as a service bus. Moving to IoT-enabled environmental monitoring systems, the publish-subscribe data exchange model is the pivotal functionality that ICN architectures have to support. In fact, an environmental monitoring system can be easily set up by letting one or more collecting stations to subscribe to the events or sensed values, generated (i.e., published) by IoT nodes scattered in the scenario of interest. Unfortunately, the support for publish-subscribe functionalities is not uniform across the main ICN architectures designed so far. To shed some light on this issue, the present contribution analyzes to what extent ICN architectures are able to support publish-subscribe and highlights the missing building blocks to purse this objective.",2017 14th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS),2017,citation

Recently, content centric network (CCN) is proposed as an alternative of the future network architecture. In CCN, data itself, which is authenticated and secured, is a name and can be directly requested at the network level instead of using IP and DNS. Moreover, routers in CCN have caching abilities. Then end users can obtain the data from routers instead of remote server if the content has been stored in the routers, thus the overall network performance could be improved by reducing the transmission hops. Orthogonally, video plays a more and more important role nowadays and dominates the network traffic. Response time of each video request greatly affects the quality of user experience (QoE), users may even abandon the requested video service if they have to wait for long time before the video playback. Hence how to provide fast-start video delivery in CCN is critical. In this paper, we target to provide users fast-start video delivery in CCN. Specifically, we design a new caching policy for popularity-aware video caching in topology-aware CCN. And we propose to encode the video using scalable video coding (SVC) for fast-start video delivery and cache each video layer separately following the designed caching policies. Given an assigned weight by users, the tradeoff between the waiting time and received video quality is studied. Simulations are conducted to verify the performances and the results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes significantly in typical scenarios.",Mob.

In this paper, a Request Expectation Index (RXI) based cache replacement algorithm for streaming content delivery is proposed. In this algorithm, RXI is introduced to serve as a fine-grained and unified estimation criteria of possible future request probability for cached chunks. RXI is customized for streaming content delivery by adopting both file-level and chunk-level request probability and considering the dynamically varied request status at each route as well. Compared to prior work, the proposed algorithm evicts the chunk with the minimum expectation of future request to maintain a high cache utilization. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate that the RXI-based algorithm can remarkably enhance the streaming content delivery performance and can be deployed in complex network scenarios. The proposed results validate that, by taking fine-grained request probability and request status into consideration, the customized in-network caching algorithm can improve the ICN streaming content delivery performance by high cache utilization, fast content delivery, and lower network traffic.",Future Internet,2017,citation

Given the over-abundance of data, consumers will seldom need all data on a topic, but rather will increasingly favor an appropriate sampling for summarization purposes. The paper explores such sampling as a novel service enabled by information-centric networking paradigms that name data objects, not hosts. By naming data objects, it becomes possible to selectively retrieve them, but the properties of the resulting sampling depend on the naming scheme. This paper describes an automated object naming service, called Espresso, that facilitates content sampling over information- centric networks. We show how Espresso, combined with a trivial retrieval policy, translates the sampling problem into a naming problem, and customizes the naming to different applications' sampling needs. Experimental results show that the computational overhead of automated naming is affordable. The service is first evaluated in simulation, demonstrating a higher sampled-data utility to the consumer, while balancing retrieved data importance and diversity. Social network applications are then introduced, where naming is produced by Espresso. Results demonstrate the advantages of Espresso, compared to baselines, in terms of retrieving meaningful media data summaries.","2017 14th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)",2017,citation

A current focus on Information-Centric Networks (ICN) promises a novel approach to intrinsically handling large content dissemination, caching and retrieval. While ubiquitous in-network caching in ICNs can expedite video delivery, a pressing challenge lies in provisioning scalable video streaming over adaptive requests for different bit rates. In this paper, we propose novel video caching schemes in ICN, to address variable bit rates and content sizes for best cache utilization. Our objective is to maximize overall throughput to improve the Quality of Service (QoS). In order to achieve this goal, we model the dynamic characteristics of rate adaptation, deriving caps on average delay, and propose DaCPlace which optimizes cache placement decisions. Building on DaCPlace, we further present a heuristic scheme, StreamCache, for low-overhead adaptive video caching. We conduct comprehensive simulations on NS-3 (specifically under the ndnSIM module).

In essence, ProCacheMob adopts the predicted future Interests, that will be sent to the mobile Producers, and caches their data contents ahead of handover. Thus, avoids Interest retransmission that increases the Consumer's delay and decreases the network efficiency during Producer's mobility.

As mobile ad hoc networks frequently merge and split in such mobile fog network scenarios, the node addresses must be changed too. This implies that a session may be broken if one of the peers is assigned a new IP address. To overcome this problem, this article proposes a novel structured late-binding address that makes use of node contexts to determine the logical destination group carried in the packet header. The idea is to hide internal mobile ad hoc network details (e.g. addresses) from external sources. The mobile ad hoc network advertises only its own ID and the list of internal contexts. When an external sender transmits a packet to a remote mobile ad hoc network, it must choose first the combination of contexts (i.e. qualifications) that an internal node must present to get the packet. This gives rise to a new data delivery paradigm called polycast. Namely, the physical identities of the destination(s) are determined only when the packet reaches the target mobile ad hoc network. Consequently, the number of destinations can vary from zero (no match) to unicast and multicast depending on the set of contexts. Say, the destinations and routing mode (e.g. unicast, multicast, or broadcast) are determined by the contexts. Simulation models are used to evaluate the scheme and to determine sensitivity to network variables.",Int. J. Distributed Sens. Networks,2017,citation

The increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) services causes tremendous growth of the amount of produced data. These data must be effectively stored and retrieved by the IoT service providers. The solution is to access the data through application programming interfaces. The paper focuses on the problem of designing an effective data storage service for IoT, which will be available through the universal application programming interface. We propose and analyze eight variants of the distributed data storage service that differ in the database structure, that is, the hierarchical structure based on Data-Oriented Network Architecture or the flat structure based on distributed hash table, the type of stored records, and the memory management algorithm that decides about using cache or base memory. The proposed solutions have been evaluated in the comprehensive simulation studies. The obtained results confirmed the effectiveness of the preferred solution with Dynamic Routing Records stored in the cache memory. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Int. J. Netw.

And a consumer usually does not know the name of the IoT data before initializing the request, instead the consumer can specify some major semantics information to be matched by the returned data, e.g. location, time. The paper proposes mechanisms to provide the simultaneous data discovery and retrieval support in ICN architectures. The routing table can be aggregated based on the major semantics information of data. The network resource and consumer's cost can be reduced by giving flexibility to the consumer in tolerating certain degree of semantics deviation between the requested and returned data. We give the analysis on the average number of hops that the interest message traversed in the network with an IoT use case. The performance evaluation shows the significant cost reduction with the increased caching probability in en-route routers as well as the increased semantics information matching probabilities.","2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)",2017,citation

The ICN uses contents name as the ID for recognizing the communication partner instead of the traditional IP network using IP address (terminal location). Nowadays, the NDN which is the one of the network technology realizing the ICN policy, has been proposed. In NDN, routers consisting the backbone network collect the contents recent requested by users. By using NDN, users can obtain the desired contents from those routers caching the corresponding one. Hence, the network traffic induced by the user requests can be reduced significantly. However, the effects of the in-network caching on NDN will be largely influenced by the cache management algorithm. Currently, most researchers consider the LRU for the typical for the NDN. In the NDN, it is well known that the use of LRU induces the unfairness problem among the users. So, in this paper, we propose to cooperative cache management for increasing performance of cache hit ratio on NDN.",2017 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA),2017,citation

In general, security and privacy are considered as essential requirements in ICN. However, existing ICN designs lack built-in privacy protection for content providers (CPs), e.g., any router in an Internet Service Provider in ICN can cache any content, which may result in information leakage. In this paper, we propose Mandatory Content Access Control (MCAC), a distributed information flow control mechanism to enable a content provider to control which network nodes can cache its contents. In MCAC, a CP defines different security labels for different contents, and content routers check these labels to decide if a content object should be cached. To ensure correct enforcement of MCAC, we also propose a design of a trusted architecture by extending existing mainstream router architectures. We evaluate the performance of MCAC in the NS-3 simulator. The simulation results show that enforcing MCAC in routers does not introduce significant overhead in content forwarding.",IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,2017,citation

In this research work, AMI communication topology and data traffic are characterized. Corresponding simulation environment is then built.

A key challenge is the design of a scalable global name resolution service (GNRS) that rapidly and reliably resolves name identities to network addresses under high mobility. In this work, we present GMap, an innetwork GNRS that provides fast lookups through a hierarchical organization that exploits spatial locality queries while retaining the simplicity and scalability of a random replicated DHT approach. To provide a lightweight solution, GMap avoids perentity state maintenance by deploying K replicas uniformly for each identifier-to-locator mapping. In the presence of skewed lookup popularity, server workloads are balanced by caches along the routing paths of lookup queries. This is in contrast to overlay name resolution services (such as the recently proposed scheme called “Auspice”) in which placement needs to be optimized for each entry. Specific design issues are addressed for the proposed GMap service, including cache cost, server churn behaviors, and expected server capacity. Compared to DMap, a prior in-network GNRS, evaluation results show that GMap reduces the 95th percentile query latency from 100ms to around 20ms, with the maximum server workload deviation reduced more than fiftyfold.",,2016,citation

We deployed both implementations on a state-of-the-art hardware platform and analyzed their performance under different configurations. Our analysis shows that with both implementations it is possible to achieve a throughput of approximately 10 Mpps, saturating 10 Gbit/s links with packet as small as 100 bytes.

However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center.

In this paper, we present a systematic framework of video streaming in the context of information-centric networking, in order to facilitate the large-scale deployment of the dynamic adaptive streaming technique. Specifically, we design the network as a two-layer coordinating structure, namely, the control layer and the transmission layer. The control layer employs the statistical data recorders to record the variations of the video popularity, link states, and user demands. On the other side, the network forwards user requests and caches data packets in the transmission layer, based on the statistical data which is obtained in the control layer. In addition, the network executes the real-time monitoring of link conditions in the transmission layer, and adjusts the video bit-rate accordingly. Under the above feedback circumstance, we first develop a distributed algorithm of joint dynamic forwarding and caching to theoretically maximize the total user demand rates within the network stability region. Then, we modify the distributed algorithm with a practical caching strategy to make the system applicable to real scenarios. Simulation results show the superior performance of the modified distributed algorithm in terms of low user delay and high QoE performance.",IEEE Access,2016,citation

In this paper, upon exploring the unique hop-by-hop Interest forwarding feature, based on the CUBIC, we develop a novel congestion control mechanism for NDN. Our congestion control mechanism, namely EC-CUBIC, borrows the core idea of CUBIC to control the sending rate of interest packets on consumers. Specially, in routers, we queue the data packets in every face and according to the queue length to send a congestion signal to consumers, upon which consumers take action timely for the congestion. In addition, we implement this mechanism in ndnSIM, an NS3-based simulator, and conduct a number of experiments with various settings to evaluate the link utilization and packets-drop rate of the proposed algorithm. Comparing with the naive congestion control algorithm in NDN, our experimental results demonstrate that EC-CUBIC perform bette in terms of high link utilization and low packets-drop rate.",2016 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC),2016,citation

Hence, an information model is essential in representing information appropriately to supports meaningful information spreading. As a distinction from the current network practice, the NDN shall concentrate on the content itself, rather than the location of the information itself. One important and common feature of NDN is leveraging through its built-in network caches (temporal store) to improve the communication and efficiency of content dissemination. Thus, caching is well thought-out as one of the most crucial features (especially in PIT) of the NDN. Its efficiency is due to it required feature of producing a flexible strategy in deciding what content to store and replace when the PIT overflows. Thus, PIT management in NDN continues being one of the primary concerns of high-speed forwarding. To address this issue, replacement policies, as one of the key factors for determining the effectiveness of a PIT in line with many researcher's haven to propose numerous replacement policies, i.e. LRU, Random and Persistent, which have been projected to attain the improved Interest drop rate, reduce the delay and Interest retransmission as when the PIT is full. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have not been studies that dealt with the performance and evaluation between the mentioned policies under different network topologies. Therefore, in this paper we study the performance of Interest drop rate, delay and Interest retransmission under different network topologies, i.e. Tree, Abilene and Germany when the PIT is full. The significance yearned for this study would be to provide a solid starting point in research directions of new PIT replacement policies for contemporary workload or selectively turning off of fewer used cache ways.",,2016,citation

The key insight of ICN is that the usage of the Internet has dramatically changed from connecting nodes to accessing information. By the inspiration of ICN thinking, we argue that it is not the ossification of the IP architecture which matters, but the ossification of the business model between ISPs. In this paper, we propose a Supply Chain Management (SCM) based business model to regulate the business relationships between ISPs. The payment flow along Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is changed from the conventional bottom up mode to a chain like mode, very similar to the payment flow of SCM.

When a client wants to obtain a piece of content represented by an SID, it sends an Interest (or GET) packet containing the SID to the network. The network then routes the GET packet domain-by-domain toward the content provider. In every domain A, the RM will look up its SID table in order to determine the next hop domain B toward the provider, and appends the inter-domain path identifier between domains A and B. Since the number of SID entries are huge and an RM needs to process plenty of GET packets per second, it is interesting to investigate the capability of RMs so as to evaluate the scalability of the CoLoR architecture. In this paper, we present a baseline implementation of RMs based on DPDK by using the optimistic concurrent cuckoo hashing. Our evaluation shows that an RM can process up to 18.3 million GET packets per second, if it is equipped with two 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces and a 4-core i7 CPU while maintaining a forwarding table of half a billion SID entries.

All routers in ICN will maintain caching ability, and, for each request, contents are cached at routers along the delivery path. This kind of on-path caching can reduce overall retrieval time. However, the same contents may end up to be cached all over the network causing wastes of caching space and decrease content diversity. Coordinated caching policy decides which contents to be stored at which routers cooperatively for better utilizing cache space. Nevertheless, with limited storage, most of coordinated caching policies use all the caching capacity to store popular contents. It may raise a fairness issue in which unpopular contents can not access caching space and thus lower overall performance. In this paper we propose a hybrid coordinated caching algorithm. By splitting cache space into two parts running different mechanisms respectively, it provides accessibility for both popular and unpopular contents. The evaluation results show that fairness is uplifted while maintaining high hit ratio and minimized latency.",,2016,citation

Although NDN is designed to defense the majority Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in the current Internet, it anticipates some new varietal DDoS attacks. A representative DDoS form is called Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA), which can be launched easily by overflowing the PIT and can do immeasurable damage to the NDN. The existing IFA detection and countermeasure methods are mainly based on the PIT abnormal state statistics. However, these methods may cause misjudgment and damage the legitimate users, especially in the case of low-rate DDoS attacks or network congestion. In this paper, we propose an IFA detection scheme based on cumulative entropy by monitoring the content request abnormal distribution and then provide the malicious prefix identification method by relative entropy theory. An Interest traceback countermeasure is also used to restrain the attacker after detection. Therefore, the proposed scheme can reduce the IFA misjudgment and protect the legitimate user, and at the same time, can avoid overreaction to normal traffic fluctuation. Simulation results reveal that our methods can effectively mitigate the IFA in NDN.",2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2016,citation

In this work, we focus on the cache allocation and replacement strategy in CCN, aiming at improving the energy efficiency and resource utilization within the scope of an ISP. We first explain the Interests aggregation in Pending Interest Table (PIT) is very weak and the in-network energy consumption largely relies on the average bit-level Data download hop count. Then we present a heuristic scheme called Distributed Energy-Efficient (DEE) caching that dynamically replicates Data among the delivery path based on: a) the popularity-hop product; b) the impacts of bias requesting, information inconsistency and Interest timeliness. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DEE. The proposed scheme exhibits constantly superior performance not only in energy efficiency, but also in cache hits and content download delay, which enhances user experience and cache network stability.",J.

However, creating a smooth migration path from the current IP network to the ICN is a challenging task that must be investigated. Network function virtualization (NFV) is one of the key technologies to achieve this migration because of its flexibility in supporting new network services as software. Nevertheless, when we consider the deployment of ICN services over NFV, two performance issues are found: processing delay of name look-up and computational overhead of the virtual machine. In this paper we propose NFV infrastructure-assisted name-based forwarding by integrating the name look-up into the Open vSwitch. The contributions are twofold: 1) First, we provide a novel look-up scheme that can forward ICN packets without costly longest prefix match searching. 2) Second, we integrate this forwarding scheme into the virtualization infrastructure to mitigate computational overhead.",2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2016,citation

In this paper, we focus on video dissemination in information-centric cognitive radio networks (IC-CRNs) and investigate the use of harvested bands for proactively caching video contents at the locations close to the interested users to improve the performance of video distribution. With consideration of the dynamic and unobservable nature of some parameters, we formulate the allocation of harvested bands as a Markov decision process with hidden and dynamic parameters and transform it into a partially observable Markov decision process and a multi-armed bandit formulation. Based on them, we develop a new spectrum management mechanism, which maximizes the benefit of proactive video caching as well as the efficiency of spectrum utilization in the IC-CRNs. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed scheme for video streaming.",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2016,citation

Thus, the Content-Centric Networking (CCN) has become the research focus of next-generation Internet architecture. However, the requirements of supporting content provider mobility are not considered. To solve this problem, we propose proactive caching of vital nodes to support content provider mobility. Through collecting the content distribution and quantity in the network and calculating the vital nodes in the network based on existing methods, we analyze the content distribution in the vital nodes and finally find the nodes with content sparsely distributed. Then the content provider sends the popular contents to these vital nodes, thus increasing the number of popular content and reducing the handoff frequency of content provider.",2016 5th International Conference on Computer Science and Network Technology (ICCSNT),2016,citation

Usage patterns on the Internet have changed a lot since the network was first designed and deployed in the 1960ies. From being a point-to-point communications and resource sharing platform, the Internet has evolved into the planet’s premier content distribution platform. This change in the way the network is being used means that the underlying transport mechanisms, in the form of TCP, UDP, and IP, are no longer as well suited to catering for the network’s netizens as they were when they were first designed. Where the protocols concern themselves with transporting opaque data streams from one named endpoint in the network to another, their users are more concerned with what data is delivered to their systems and less with where it came from. Users no longer care whether they are connected to a server in Ireland or Columbia, as long as it delivers the content they request from it. As a result, a research sphere has sprung up around a replacement paradigm called Information-Centric Networking (ICN). ICNs make content, and the names that it is addressable by, the primary routing mechanism in the network, rather than IP addresses as is the case today. This makes them uniquely suitable to servicing the needs of modern users, in that both network and users can now focus on what content is delivered rather than where to retrieve it from. ICNs typically provide features such as name-based routing, which alleviates the need for name resolution overlays such as the Domain Name System, in-network caching, which decreases the network traffic by utilizing nearby copies of requested content, and intrinsic content consumer mobility, which allows user nodes to roam freely throughout the network without having to be assigned domain-specific addresses, as is the case with IP.",,2016,citation

Strategic content replication techniques reduce response time and the amount of network resources (e.g. bandwidth and server load). Thus, more than one path can be followed to reach the same content. however, each router does not have all information of cached data in the network, which makes it difficult for nodes to know the shortest path to forward interests. CCN as a networking architecture needs to define concise methods to control traffic when multipath is used to access to the same object. In this paper we will make an attempt to model a simplified subset of the general phenomena of multipath traffic control that we suppose can be described using some of the tools provided by notions imported from Game Theory.",2016 International Conference on Advanced Communication Systems and Information Security (ACOSIS),2016,citation

We consider the problem of optimizing the delivery of video content to mobile clients while meeting the constraints imposed by the available network resources. Observing the bandwidth available in the network's two main components, core network, transferring the video from the servers to edge nodes close to the client, and the edge network, which is in charge of transferring the content to the user via wireless links, we aim to find an optimal solution by exploiting the predictability of future user requests of sequential video segments, as well as the knowledge of available infrastructural resources at the core and edge wireless networks in a given future time window. Instead of regarding the bottleneck of the end-to-end connection as our throughput, we distribute the traffic load over time and use intermediate nodes between the server and the client for buffering video content to achieve higher throughput, and ultimately significantly improve the Quality of Experience for the end user in comparison with current solutions.",2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),2015,citation

Traditional applications using pub/sub systems require large-scale deployment and high event throughput. Thus, pub/sub has always put the emphasis on scalability and performance, to the detriment of filtering expressiveness and quality of service. The matching language is usually limited to topic-based or content-based event filtering and does not allow complex stream-based subscriptions to be expressed. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis without any ordering or reliability guarantees. Recently, modern pub/sub applications such as online games, social networks, and sensor networks, have specifications which extend beyond the basic semantics provided by standard systems. Installing additional services and event processing systems at the endpoints can overcome these limitations. However, this thesis argue that such solutions are inefficient and put an avoidable strain on the pub/sub layer itself. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is to develop integrated solutions to extend pub/sub language expressiveness and quality of service, as well as demonstrate that this approach results in better performance from a holistic perspective. The different pub/sub extensions described are ranked data dissemination, fair subscription filtering, and total order. Each section first describes the applica-",,2016,citation

In CON, however, we encounter a scalability problem regarding content acquisition, particularly in large-scale networks composed of multiple domains, because the total amount of content is much larger than the number of network nodes. CON requires a more scalable routing scheme than the traditional IP routing. We have proposed a breadcrumbs-based architecture to establish highly scalable content routing for the content-oriented paradigm. In this paper, we consider another novel approach for controlling guidance (routing) information. We propose a breadcrumbs-scoping (BC-scoping) framework that manages the distribution scope of guidance information according to some criteria. First, we propose BC-scoping on domain, which limits the distribution scope of guidance information within domains according to a hierarchical network structure. It promotes intradomain content acquisition and prevents the occurrence of cross-domain BC trails, because intradomain content acquisition is preferred, both technically and economically. Second, we consider the use of multiple criteria simultaneously with this framework when the criteria are independent of each other. Specifically, we propose BC-scoping on domain and popularity as a practical example of BC-scoping on multiple-criteria. For both of the proposed methods, we show the effectiveness through extensive computer simulation.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2016,citation

In the case of the CCN structure, we argue that: 1) for video multiplexing scenario, general cache strategies that ignore the intrinsic linear time characteristic of video requests are unable to make better use of the cache resources, and 2) it is inadequate to simply extend the existing research conclusions of file-oriented popularity to chunk-by-chunk popularity, which are widely used in CCN. Unlike previous works in this field, the proposed policy in this study, named two-level popularity-oriented time-to-hold cache replacement policy (TLP-TTH), is designed on the basis of the following principles. Firstly, the proposed cache replacement strategy is customized for video delivery by carefully considering the essential auto-correlated request feature of video chunks within a video file. Furthermore, the popularity in video delivery is subdivided into two levels, namely chunk-level access probability and file-level popularity, in order to efficiently utilize cache resources. We evaluated the proposed policy in both a hierarchical topology and a real network based hybrid topology, and took viewers departure into consideration as well. The results validate that for video delivery over CCN, TLP-TTH policy improves the network performance from several aspects. In particular, we observed that the proposed policy not only increases the cache hit ratio at the edge of the network but the cache utilization at the intermediate routers is also improved markedly. Further, with respect to the video popularity variation scenario, the cache hit ratio of TLP-TTH policy responds sensitively to maintain efficient cache utilization. key words: content-centric networking, in-network caching, TLP-TTH, popularity",IEICE Trans.

The default caching strategy of CCN is to store at each content-router along the downloading path. While this helps in increasing content availability and quality-of-experience (QoE) by reducing delay and reducing server load, the approach is not resource-efficient as it introduces high cache redundancy. Hence, there is a need to devise efficient caching mechanisms that allows maximum availability of content while consuming minimum possible resources. In this paper, we propose Multi-Attribute Caching Strategy (MAC) for CCN Networks that is based on using multiple parameters instead of a single attribute. These parameters include hop count or distance, node degree, content popularity and available storage space at the nodes. The scheme promises to overcome inefficient cache utilization by intelligently selecting caching locations along the content delivery paths. Simulation results indicate that MAC reduces the cache load at each node while increasing network cache hit rate.",2016 13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC),2016,citation

They bring up many research challenges, such as addressing content by name, securing content, and wide-spread caching of content. Caching has caught a lot of attention in the research community, but a lot of the work suffers from a poor understanding of the different metrics with which caching performance can be measured. In this paper we not only present a comprehensive overview of different caching metrics that have been proposed for information-centric networks, but also propose the coupling factor as a new metric to capture the relation- ship between content popularity and network topology. As we show, many commonly used metrics have several failure modes which are largely ignored in literature. We identify these problems and propose remedies and new metrics to address these failures. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between information-centric caches and ""traditional"" cache networks and we demonstrate the need for a systematic understanding of the metrics for information- centric caching. We also discuss how experimental work should be done when evaluating networks of caches.",ArXiv,2016,citation

We develop a MinMax problem to compute the optimal solution to retrieve all the chunks from multiple sources in the shortest time. We prove that the problem is NP complete and thus design a fully polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve this problem. However, the previous works on multipath congestion control cannot be directly employed in MSRT. Therefore, we then propose the Half eXplicit Congestion Protocol (HXCP) to control the request/transmission pace in MSRT. To demonstrate the performance of MSRT, we construct comprehensive experiments. The results show that 1) our scheme reduces the content transmission time to at most 80%; 2) our multipath congestion control scheme HXCP effectively avoids congestion, improves the throughput and guarantees the fairness in the multi-source/multipath scenario.",2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS),2016,citation

Furthermore, optimum linked-content placement can improve users QoS more and more. When a content is requested by a user, moving related contents i.e. linked-content closer to the user can improve the user’s QoS because the user is likely to request these contents as well. However, multiple-content placement optimization is proven to be NP-complete, and even finding a suboptimal solution often has high calculation complexity.

This allows for efficient simultaneous mobility and supports seamless handoff for interactive communication. The main goals of this paper are: a to propose a mobility scheme suitable for all mobile nodes in CCN, both the publishers and subscribers; b to describe the hierarchical mobility management procedure during intra-domain and inter-domain handoff; c to establish an analytical model and formulate the location update signalling cost, handoff delay; d to calculate k",UbiComp 2016,2016,citation

To this end, ICN relies on in-network caching where routers cache content they have seen with the hope of satisfying future requests for the same content and relieving the original data servers. While in-network caching proved beneficial for a more efficient retrieval of content, it has also caused the emergence of several privacy risks. Timing attacks are one such privacy breach where attackers use timing analysis of data retrievals to analyze users' interests in particular content. In this paper, we propose centrality-based caching to mitigate such attacks and use the anonymity set privacy metric to show that our strategy does provide privacy guarantees. Moreover, our simulations show that we can still achieve high hit rates and low delays while alleviating the network's vulnerability to timing attacks.",MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference,2016,citation

At the same time, it supports to independently switch the retrieval modes between vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) according to the popularity of contents.

In the forwarding plane, CCN employs a stateful forwarding scheme, which maintains per-packet state information in Pending Interest Table (PIT). By employing stateful forwarding, CCN enables native support for content requests aggregation and multicast. However, the stateful forwarding scheme requires large-sized PITs with extremely high access speed to store per-packet state information, leading to scalability issue. To overcome the issue, this paper proposes a Hybrid forwarding scheme based on content POPularity (HyPOP) for CCN. HyPOP classifies the contents into popular and unpopular contents, and uses the stateful and Bloom Filter based stateless forwarding schemes to forward the popular and unpopular contents, respectively. The mathematical analysis results demonstrate that if PITs only store state information for popular contents, the small-sized PITs are sufficient for achieving satisfactory forwarding performance. Furthermore, the extensive simulation results also verify that HyPOP can reduce the size of PIT significantly and achieve promising forwarding performance.",2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),2016,citation

We consider tree-structured networks with variable hierarchies under the widely used En-route caching assumption. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm performs well compared to the optimal solution, and only a limited fraction of nodes becomes hybrid regardless of the network size.

A network based fast handover procedure is also integrated to guarantee a mobile user’s better handover experience in the proposed scheme.

In the ICN architecture, the content is the major element and the data name is used for routing the content, instead of the address location as in the Internet nowadays. Furthermore, it is desirable to cache as much data as possible near the user, aiming to improve performance and reduce data transfer. However, data confidentiality can be compromised once it is complex to the content publisher control the access to sensitive data. Although many architectures allow the use of encryption, the key management and the user revocation can be challenging. One possible solution is to insert a proxy to intermediate the access to sensitive data, using a technique named proxy re-encryption (PRE), despite the fact that it inputs an additional overhead to the access.

Our proposed threshold reflects the effect of local disk size and favors the long-term content popularity. Simulation-based studies show that, there exists an optimal point in the performance space of cache utilization ratio. What's more, given relative small size cache disk resource, the optimal threshold setting can outperform the default CCN caching policy greatly in either user experienced request delay and cache utilization ratio.",2016 2nd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),2016,citation

However, moving the address space from IP addresses to content names brings the scalability issues to a whole new level, due to two reasons. First, name aggregation is not as trivial a task as the IP address aggregation in BGP routing. Second, the number of addressable contents in the Internet is several orders of magnitude higher than the number of IP addresses. With the current size of the Internet, name based, anycast routing is very challenging specially when routing efficiency is of prime importance. We propose a name-based routing scheme $\alpha$ Route for ICN that offers efficient bandwidth usage, guaranteed content lookup and scalable routing table size. $\alpha$ Route consists of two components: an alphanumeric Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and an overlay to underlay (Internet topology) mapping algorithm.

ICN focuses on retrieval and dissemination of information between pairwise communications of hosts. Information are organized in the form of Information Objects (IO), known as Named Data Objects (NDO). These NDO are location independent. Objects in ICN are stored in the system overlay; popularly known as Name Resolution System (NRS). NDOs are requested by the Subscribers in the network to get the needed information from the Publishers, through NRS. Thus, the NRS is responsible in forwarding the interest packets based on the names of NDOs. This application of ICN depends on the scalability of the NRS. To design NRS, the most significant issue is scalability due to the ever-increasing number of NDOs. This paper aims to present the issues, by proposing balanced binary tree data structure to organize and store the NDOs. The methodology proposed in this work is thus; for every new insertion in the tree, a Balance Factor (BF) is computed to balance the height of left and right sub-tree.

Comparing these values with the corresponding throughput and latency with no cache capability (throughput inversely proportional to the network size, and latency of order √n and the inverse of the transmission range in grid and random networks, respectively), we can actually quantify the asymptotic advantage of caching.

An NDN router caches the data in its content store, greatly reducing network traffic. NDN adopts the hierarchical naming schema, which allows the name aggregation and enables high scalability. However, in a richly connected topology, the nearest data replica are often not on the path dictated by NDN's tree-like data fetching model. This might result in a lower data delivery efficiency compared with the flat self-certifying naming schema in other Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architectures. To address the low efficiency problem, we propose a CDN-like enhancement to the NDN design, called Fetching the Nearest Replica (FNR). In FNR, when a consumer sends an interest for a popular data, the data is fetched from the nearest replica in the network, regardless of whether it is on the best path from the producer to the consumer. We present the design details and theoretical overhead analysis for FNR. Our evaluation results using ndnSIM simulator show that on average FNR reduces the total (inter-domain, intra-domain) traffic by 25.6% (53.0%, 18.2%) on average, compared to the default NDN approach. In addition, the average latency is reduced by 37% and the average cost is reduced by 51.4%.

In ICN, the content items are stored temporarily in network nodes such as routers. When the memory of routers becomes full and there is no room for a new 
arriving content, the stored contents are evicted to cope with the limited cache size of the routers. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an effective caching strategy for keeping popular contents for a longer period of time. This study proposes a new caching strategy, named Flexible Popularity-based Caching (FlexPop) for storing popular contents. 
The FlexPop comprises two mechanisms, i.e., Content Placement Mechanism (CPM), which is responsible for content caching, and Content Eviction Mechanism 
(CEM) that deals with content eviction when the router cache is full and there is no space for the new incoming content. Both mechanisms are validated using Fuzzy Set Theory, following the Design Research Methodology (DRM) to manifest that the research is rigorous and repeatable under comparable conditions. The performance of FlexPop is evaluated through simulations and the results are compared with those of the Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE), ProbCache, and Most Popular Content (MPC) strategies. The results show that the FlexPop strategy outperforms LCE, ProbCache, 
and MPC with respect to cache hit rate, redundancy, content retrieval delay, memory utilization, and stretch ratio, which are regarded as extremely important metrics (in various studies) for the evaluation of ICN caching. The outcomes exhibited in this study are noteworthy in terms of making FlexPop acceptable to users as they can verify 
the performance of ICN before selecting the right caching strategy. Thus FlexPop has potential in the use of ICN for the future Internet such as in deployment of the IoT technology.",,2016,citation

Named data networking (NDN) is a new emerging architecture for future network, which may be a substitute of the current TCP/IP-based network, for the content-oriented data request mode becoming the future trend of development. The security of NDN has attracted much attention, as an implementation of next-generation Internet architecture. Although NDN is immune to most current attack, it cannot resist the distributed denial of service like attack – Interest flooding attack (IFA) – effectively. IFA takes advantages of the forwarding mechanism of NDN, flooding a large number of malicious Interest packets at quite a high rate, and exploits the network resources, which may cause the paralysis of the network. Taking into account the severity of the destruction, we propose an algorithm to counter such new type of attack. We analyze three properties of IFA, and use them to judge and filter Interest packets. Vector space model and Markov model are used in our method to realize a cooperative detection. Meanwhile, we present the retransmission forwarding mechanism to ensure legitimate user request. The ndnSIM module of ns3 is used for the corresponding simulation, and results of the simulation will be given to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.

ICNs are based on three main concepts: content forwarding, in-network caching, and multicasting. To realize these three key concepts, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as an important potential candidate, due to its ability to implement all network intelligence in a reprogrammable device known as the controller. However, the integration of these two networking paradigms presents many challenges. This paper studies these challenges and highlights key areas where more effort is needed from the research community. Particularly, the paper focuses on the architectural modifications necessary to incorporate SDN in ICN architectures, including the necessary modifications to the popular OpenFlow protocol. In addition, the paper studies several implementation challenges arising from the integration of SDN and ICN such as the need for a scalable and distributed SDN control that is highly responsive in meeting dynamic user requests, and the need for a semantic naming scheme for content that provides the users with a large degree of expressiveness in specifying their requests.

Such network designs show the requirements of energy efficiency, availability, high performance, and data-aware intelligence. To meet these requirements, we adopt the information-centric networking (ICN) approach, where data are retrieved through names and in-network caching is utilized. However, as the typical existing ICN architectures, content centric network (CCN) cannot efficiently utilize the caches for data sharing because of the on-path caching strategy, and network of information (NetInf) demonstrates the resolution latency for data retrievals. To design an efficient and effective ICN architecture for big data sharing, we combine the strong points of CCN and NetInf, where information islands (IOIs) and management plane are utilized for direct data retrieval and global data discovery, respectively. We provide a reference architecture and propose an aggregatable name-based routing (ANBR), which can naturally enable consumers to retrieve the closest copy of information. In this network, each piece of data can be cached at one IOI at most once, which greatly improves the efficiency of cache usages. The consumers first try to retrieve the data in the local IOI, and then try to globally retrieve it from the closest IOI, holding the copy of the data if necessary. We investigate the impact from the key factor, IOI size, to the energy consumption of ANBR. It shows that energy consumption first decreases and then increases as the IOI size increases, and the optimized IOI size can be found for deployment. Furthermore, we study the relation between the optimized IOI size and the average retrieval times for the data. The result shows that the optimized IOI size increases as the average retrieval times increase.",IEEE Access,2015,citation

This traffic volume reduction on the transit link can decrease inter-ISP transit cost. However, the memory space for caching in CCN routers is small relative to content volume. In addition, any initial access to the content requested by a user must use the transit link, even when a nearby CCN router outside the route has the cached content. In this paper, we propose a method of cooperative cache sharing among CCN routers in multiple ISPs. It aims to attain a further reduction in the inter-ISP transit cost by improving the cache hit ratio. In the proposed method, the CCN routers share the memory space for caching of non-overlapping cache content. We evaluate the proposed method by simulation experiments using the IP-level network topology of actual ISP, and show that the inter-ISP transit traffic can be reduced by up to 28% compared with normal caching behavior of CCN. key words: Content-Centric Networking, in-network caching, cache sharing, inter-ISP transit cost",IEICE Trans.

All of these redundant copies of requested contents are returned to the user, which leads to unnecessary waste of network resources. In this paper, we propose a new forwarding strategy named counteracting redundant data CRD to reduce the transmission of redundant Data. The CRD strategy introduces a new packet called Data Acknowledgement DACK to stop forwarding redundant data. When a router receives a DACK, it will delete the matched Pending Interest Table PIT entry with the same name prefix and same incoming interface as the DACK. Thus, subsequent Data will be discarded when the corresponding PIT entry in the router no longer exists. According to the transmission model with tree structure, forwarding number that indicates the number of DACK being forwarded is a very important factor affecting the transmission overhead of CRD strategy. In our simulation, the results show the CRD strategy can improve transmission efficiency, reduce transmission overhead while ensuring a certain reliability, and also decrease the storage of content store at the same time.

Based on the observation of current Internet usage, CCN presents a content-centric model which focuses on data distribution and retrieval. To enhance the efficiency of content distribution, In-network caching is adopted, which enables routers to temporarily store the passing by data. Thus the scheme of cache management will affect the network performance significantly. In this paper, a cache replacement policy named Popularity Proportional Cache Size Allocation (PPCSA) policy has been proposed, which designed for video content delivery on CCN. Unlike other previous works in this area, which have focused on the popularity of individual content chunks, in this study, we not only consider the title-level popularity of a video which is composed of a set of video segments, but also take the chunk-level probability of video segments within a video title into consideration. We evaluated our policy through simulations, by using a simple 4-level tree topology and a real network based hybrid topology. The results validate that on both scenarios, the proposed approach can increase the average cache hit ratio and shorten the average content delivery distance between requesters and object contents. In addition, we analyzed the energy efficiency of PPCSA policy, and we found that compared to other three cache replacement policies, Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and First in First out (FIFO), PPCSA reduced the transmission energy consumption, and improved the energy efficiency in idle time.",2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC),2015,citation

The DNS is established on top of Internet Protocol (IP) to provide an addressing of Internet resources. However, the IP based current Internet communication model is considered as inappropriate for supporting an explosive increase of Internet devices and contents in the Future Internet. To address the communication model issue, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed that allows a consumer only cares about what he wants but not where the content is. Although NDN designs an ideal communication model for the content-intensive Future Internet, it assumes a clean-slate deployment, which would take a long time for deployment. The coexistence of the NDN paradigm and the current Internet is thus expected. In this vein, we propose a new scheme that utilizes current DNS protocols for content naming and addressing in a NDN environment. The proposed scheme helps to accelerate the NDN evolution while providing a means of utilizing the DNS for scalable and secure NDN.",Wirel. Pers. Commun.,2015,citation

ICN treats content as the first-class entity, with nodes exchanging information based on the names of the content instead of the IP addresses of the end points requesting or providing the content. This shift from a “location-based” network to a “content-centric” network allows more efficient data dissemination, especially when the content may be available at multiple points, or the provider or consumer is mobile. 
Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) is another important content-centric communication model where publishers and subscribers only focus on the data rather than the location of each other. However, most of the ICN proposals do not have direct support for pub/sub. This inevitably results in pub/sub being implemented via polling which leads to higher network load, higher publisher load and longer latency. 
This dissertation tackles the shortcomings of existing solutions and provides a full-fledge solution for efficient pub/sub communication in ICN. By enhancing Named Data Networking (NDN) in the network layer, Content Oriented Network for Publish/Subscribe Systems (COPSS) is able to support best-effort push-based multicast that is required by pub/sub. A transport-layer protocol (Control Protocol for Scalable and Adaptive Information Dissemination (SAID)) is proposed to satisfy the need for reliability and congestion control during pub/sub. The protocol attempts to solve a long-standing issue of multicast congestion control by separating congestion control from reliability. In the application layer, an object resolution system (Object Resolution Framework in Information-Centric Environment (ORICE)) similar to a search engine is proposed to help users get identities of the data that they might need. 
The efficiency of the architecture is evaluated via applications that emulate Twitter, gaming, VoD and file transfer. Results show that the architecture can outperform existing pullbased ICN solutions in terms of response latency, network load and publisher load. 
Additionally, this dissertation extends the concept of content-concentricity to a common and important network management issue – service chaining. The design proves that this concept can be incorporated into many network designs and has the potential to make these systems more efficient and dynamic.",,2015,citation

Our main objective is to provide a mathematical model for the combination of random cache decision and least recently used (LRU) replacement policy in the content store of CCN, called LRU-PC (LRU with probabilistic caching). This analytical model contributes to the improvement on proper caching selection probability per content router, in order to achieve a good performance considering different parameters, such as the popularity of the files, cache size and others. Based on these results, the paper further contributes by extending the LRU-PC with a secondary list holding a wider view of the names of content packets that transverse a CCN node. In this case, a segment is stored in the cache with a given probability when its name is stored in this secondary list, dubbing this mechanism LRU-PCSL (LRU with probabilistic caching and a secondary list). As LRU-PC, LRU-PCSL has a constant time complexity, is scan-resistant, presents low memory requirements and is possible to implement in hardware. Evaluation results show that LRU-PCSL increases overall cache performance compared with LRU and LRU-PC.",Comput. J.,2015,citation

Because of NDN's fundamental requirement that each content object must be signed by its producer, fragmentation has been considered incompatible with NDN since it precludes authentication of individual content fragments by routers. The alternative is to perform hop-by-hop reassembly, which incurs prohibitive delays. In this paper, we show that secure and efficient content fragmentation is both possible and even advantageous in NDN and similar content-centric network architectures that involve signed content.

In this context, a routing scheme is scalable if the amount of memory needed to implement it grows significantly slower than the network size. Unfortunately, theoretical scalability characterizations only exist for shortest path routing, but for general policy routing that current and future networks increasingly rely on, very little understanding is available. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap. We define a general framework for policy routing, and we study the theoretical scaling properties of three fundamental policy models within this framework. Our most important contributions are the finding that, contrary to shortest path routing, there exist policies that inherently scale well, and a separation between the class of policies that admit compact routing tables and those that do not. Finally, we ask to what extent memory size can be decreased by allowing paths to contain a certain bounded number of policy violations and, surprisingly, we conclude that most unscalable policies remain unscalable under the relaxed model as well.",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2015,citation

Efficient Aggregated Deliveries with Strong Guarantees in Event-based Distributed Systems. Major Professor: Patrick Eugster. A popular approach to designing large scale distributed systems is to follow an eventbased approach. In an event-based approach, a set of software components interact by producing and consuming events. The event-based model allows for the decoupling of software components, allowing distributed systems to scale to a large number of components. Event correlation allows for higher order reasoning of events by constructing complex events from single, consumable events. In many cases, event correlation applications rely on centralized setups or broker overlay networks. In the case of centralized setups, the guarantees for complex event delivery are stronger, however, centralized setups create performance bottlenecks and single points of failure. With broker overlays, the performance and fault tolerance are improved but at the cost of weaker guarantees. The goal of this dissertation is to develop an efficient middleware for event correlation while still providing strong guarantees. First, we show what is necessary for strong guarantees in asynchronous distributed event-based systems that perform event correlation. Secondly, we provide the main deliverable of this dissertation: a generic middleware system, FAIDECS, which utilizes event types to efficiently correlate individually multicast events while providing strong guarantees for asynchronous event-based distributed systems. We then provide semantic alternatives to those provided in FAIDECS, showing what strong guarantees are able to be provided given certain operators.",,2015,citation

In current solutions, it is generally the client that must first select a datacenter to forward the request to before an internal load-balancer of the selected datacenter can select the optimal instance. An optimal selection requires knowledge of both network and server characteristics, making clients less suitable to make this decision. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) research solved a similar selection problem for static data retrieval by integrating content delivery as a native network feature. We address the selection problem for services by extending the ICN-principles for services. In this paper we present Queue and Latency, a network-driven service selection algorithm which maps user demand to service instances, taking into account both network and server metrics.

We have designed our original hop-by-hop Interest shaping mechanism (HoBHIS) that nicely exploits the flow balance enforced in CCN between Interest and Chunk packets. It monitors active conversations sharing the transmission buffer of a CCN node face in order to dynamically adjust their Interest sending rate and enforce the Chunk queue length to converge to a defined objective. This mechanism is implemented in each CCN node. Then, we extended HoBHIS in order to address several important concerns that might occur in CCN. We proposed a Tolerance mechanism that controls the Clients sending rate as well as prevents the loss of Interest packets.

As a result, several cooperative schemes have been developed towards reducing the downlink transmission power. One possible approach is the use of relays that forward information from the base station BS to the mobile stations MSs. However, up to now, the proposed relaying schemes are focusing solely on channel characteristics. In this work, a novel, content-aware relaying scheme is introduced, where the MSs can act as active relays based on their requested content and channel quality. Content awareness is achieved with a cross-layer algorithm, which considers an information-centric networking layer. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated considering a multiple input multiple output MIMO cellular configuration with one tier of cells around the central cell, where the downlink transmission power in terms of mean values has been compared to the typical non-content-aware case. For this reason, a hybrid system-link level simulator has been developed that executes independent Monte Carlo MC simulations in parallel. Moreover, the orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA physical layer protocol has been employed as well, in order to comply with fourth generation standards. The derived results indicate that, compared to the non-content-aware case, the proposed relay transmission algorithm can provide up to 7/17% transmission power gain in medium or highly loaded networks i.e., 10% and 40% blocking probabilities, respectively in a symmetric 2×2 MIMO configuration i.e., equal number of transmit and receive antennas. Moreover, compared to the case where no relay transmission is supported, then the aforementioned gain can reach up to 20%. Finally, the proposed algorithm can provide up to 25% reduction on the overall transmission delay from the relay node to the destination compared to the non-content-aware case.

First, it avoids re-embedding the topology by using an online greedy embedding scheme and a void handling greedy forwarding scheme.

Consequently, negative impacts, such as increased inter-ISP traffic in particular, have become critical issues that need to be kept low, due to that most popular P2P protocols are not designed to be aware of network topology. On the other hand, substantial access burden at source peers’ side can be increased due to their limited uploading bandwidth capacities, compared to the massive data demand. The top-level technical objectives of this work are thus to 1) achieve optimised usage of network resources through reducing P2P content traffic, and at the same time, 2) to provide enhanced network support to P2P applications. 
Specifically, we address the above issues in mainly two ways: 
First, in order to reduce the P2P traffic load especially over the costly inter-ISP links, we propose an advanced hybrid scheme for peer selections across multi-domains, by promoting cooperation and non-cooperation among adjacent ISPs. An analytical modelling framework is developed for analysing inter-domain peer selection schemes concerning ISP business policies. Our analytical modelling framework can be used as a guide for analysing and evaluating future network-aware P2P peer selection paradigms in general multi-domain scenarios. 
Second, with the concern of improving service quality for P2P users in terms of content access delay and transmission delay, we propose an intelligent in-network caching scheme enabled by Information-Centric Networking (ICN). A simple analytical modelling framework is developed to quantitatively evaluate the efficiency of the proposed in-network caching policy. 
We further design an ICN-driven protocol for the efficient P2P content delivery with in-network caching support. Bloom Filter (BF) techniques are adopted to save cache space and also to reduce communication overhead. A P2P-like content delivery simulator with In-network caching functionalities is built, with which extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the analytical results and to further prove the efficiency of the proposed caching scheme.",,2015,citation

One of the common scenarios of using data wireless data network is while travelling in a train. Providing in-train wireless Internet access to multimedia applications (e.g., youtube) requires 3G/4G networks. While 3G/4G networks provide fast data access when users are static, it has significant latency when being used on the train. This is because 3G/4G networks use Mobile-IP that requires mobile nodes to register to foreign agents when handover occurs. This will introduced latency for the handover process. When registration is done, Mobile-IP suffers from triangular routing, which further decreases its performance. In this paper we argue that railway networking can be more effective through named data networking (NDN). Rather than using IP addresses, NDN provides a name-based paradigm that can achieve seamless handover. We analyze how NDN can support efficient handover and conduct simulation to test its performance. Results show the efficiency of NDN.",Int. J. Mach. Learn. Cybern.,2015,citation

User communications are no longer tied up to host interconnection. Information Centric Networking (ICN) models are proposed to cope with these changes. The new paradigm redesigns the Internet architecture to bring out content to the first level. Over the last decade, many key projects have proposed a large solution spectrum to rebuilt networking primitives focused on the content. One important and direct challenge of this shift is the large amount of routing states due to identifying contents rather than hosts. In this paper, we focus especially on DONA, one of the first ICN architecture, and analyse the required memory space to store routing states. Our study shows that today's technologies are not able to satisfy the content routing needs. Thus, we propose an enhancement of DONA called BADONA to deal with this problem. It uses the Bloom filter to drastically reduce the usage of the memory space.

IP names the attachment points (where) to facilitate ubiquitous interconnectivity as the current way to deliver data. The fundamental mismatch between data delivery and naming attachment points leads to a lot of challenges, e.g., mapping from data name to IP address, handling dynamics of underlying topology, scaling up the data distribution, and securing communication, etc. Information-centric networking (ICN) is proposed to shift the focus of communication paradigm from where to what, by making the named data the first-class citizen in the network, The basic consensus of ICN is to name the data independent from its container (space dimension) and session (time dimension), which breaks the limitation of point-to-point IP semantic. It scales up data distribution by utilizing available resources, and facilitates communication to fit diverse connectivity and heterogeneous networks. However, there are only a few consensuses on the detailed design of ICN, and quite a few different ICN architectures are proposed. This paper reveals the rationales of ICN from the perspective of the Internet evolution, surveys different design choices, and discusses on two debatable topics in ICN, i.e., self-certifying versus hierarchical names, and edge versus pervasive caching.

We study the throughput capacity and delay in an information-centric network when the data cached in each node has a limited lifetime. The results show that with some fixed request and cache expiration rates, the order of the data access time does not change with network growth, and the maximum throughput order is inversely proportional to the square root and logarithm of the network size n in cases of grid and random networks, respectively. Comparing these values with the corresponding throughput and latency with no cache capability (throughput inversely proportional to the network size, and latency of order √ n and √ n logn in grid and random networks, respectively), we can actually quantify the asymptotic advantage of caching. Moreover, we compare these scaling laws for different content discovery mechanisms and illustrate that not much gain is lost when a simple path search is used.",,2015,citation

In ICN, content -rather than hosts, like in IP-based design- plays the central role in the communications. This change from host-centric to content-centric has several significant advantages such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency, scalability, etc. One of the main design requirements for the ICN architectures -since the beginning of their design- has been strong security. 
Named Data Networking (NDN) (also referred to as Content-Centric Networking (CCN) or Data-Centric Networking (DCN)) is one of these architectures that are the focus of an ongoing research effort that aims to become the way Internet will operate in the future. Existing research into security of NDN is at an early stage and many designs are still incomplete. To make NDN a fully working system at Internet scale, there are still many missing pieces to be filled in. In this dissertation, we study the four most important security issues in NDN in order to defense against new forms of -potentially unknown- attacks, ensure privacy, achieve high availability, and block malicious network traffics belonging to attackers or at least limit their effectiveness, i.e., anomaly detection, DoS/DDoS attacks, congestion control, and cache pollution attacks. In order to protect NDN infrastructure, we need flexible, adaptable and robust defense systems which can make intelligent -and real-time- decisions to enable network entities to behave in an adaptive and intelligent manner. In this context, the characteristics of Computational Intelligence (CI) methods such as adaption, fault tolerance, high computational speed and error resilient against noisy information, make them suitable to be applied to the problem of NDN security, which can highlight promising new research directions. Hence, we suggest new hybrid CI-based methods to make NDN a more reliable and viable architecture for the future Internet.",,2015,citation

With these figures on its side, arguing against the Internet's scalability would seem rather unwise. However, the Internet's organic growth is far from finished and, as billions of new devices are expected to be joined in the not so distant future, scalability, or lack thereof, is commonly believed to be the Internet's biggest problem. 
While consensus on the exact form of the solution is yet to be found, the need for a semantic decoupling of a node's location and identity, often called a location/identity separation, is generally accepted as a promising way forward. Typically, this requires the introduction of new network elements that provide the binding of the two names-paces and caches that avoid hampering router packet forwarding speeds. But due to this increased complexity the solution's scalability is itself questioned. 
This dissertation evaluates the suitability of using the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), one of the most successful proposals to follow the location/identity separation guideline, as a solution to the Internet's scalability problem. However, because the deployment of any new architecture depends not only on solving the incumbent's technical problems but also on the added value that it brings, our approach follows two lines. In the first part of the thesis, we develop the analytical tools to evaluate LISP's control plane scalability while in the second we show that the required control/data plane separation provides important benefits that could drive LISP's adoption. 
As a first step to evaluating LISP's scalability, we propose a methodology for an analytical analysis of cache performance that relies on the working-set theory to estimate traffic locality of reference. One of our main contribution is that we identify the conditions network traffic must comply with for the theory to be applicable and then use the result to develop a model that predicts average cache miss rates. Furthermore, we study the model's suitability for long term cache provisioning and assess the cache's vulnerability in front of malicious users through an extension that accounts for cache polluting traffic. As a last step, we investigate the main sources of locality and their impact on the asymptotic scalability of the LISP cache. An important finding here is that destination popularity distribution can accurately describe cache performance, independent of the much harder to model short term correlations. Under a small set of assumptions, this result finally enables us to characterize asymptotic scalability with respect to the amount of prefixes (Internet growth) and users (growth of the LISP site). We validate the models and discuss the accuracy of our assumptions using several one-day-long packet traces collected at the egress points of a campus and an academic network. 
To show the added benefits that could drive LISP's adoption, in the second part of the thesis we investigate the possibilities of performing inter-domain multicast and improving intra-domain routing. Although the idea of using overlaid services to improve underlay performance is not new, this dissertation argues that LISP offers the right tools to reliably and easily implement such services due to its reliance on network instead of application layer support. In particular, we present and extensively evaluate Lcast, a network-layer single-source multicast framework designed to merge the robustness and efficiency of IP multicast with the configurability and low deployment cost of application-layer overlays. Additionally, we describe and evaluate LISP-MPS, an architecture capable of exploiting LISP to minimize intra-domain routing tables and ensure, among other, support for multi protocol switching and virtual networks.",,2015,citation

The latest version of the CCN protocol (CCN 1.0) adopts the end-to-end fragmentation method that fragments CCN messages only at the content publisher. This allows intermediate routers to simply forward fragmentation packets, and hence this can solve the problem of the processing delay at routers in the existing fragmentation methods for the CCN.

There has been a lot of emphasis on providing good web page performance for mobile devices. Client-side caching can play a significant role in providing good web page performance, but unfortunately, traditional browser caches lack in various aspects leading to sub-optimal performance. More specifically, web applications do not have control on caching, e.g., which resources to cache, how to cache, etc., leading to ineffective cache utilization. Recently, HTML5 has introduced number of persistent storage APIs, that can provide required control for web applications. We evaluate these HTML5 storage options on various devices, and find that they can also meet the performance criteria of caching; in fact, some of the HTML5 storage APIs, e.g., localStorage, can provide even better performance than browser cache. Based on these insights, we make a case for application-managed hierarchical client-side cache, called HCache, that leverages these storage options as backends. We propose a novel API that allows web application developers to intelligently control the caching behavior and the usage of these storage options transparently. Our experiments with a prototype show that HCache can improve web page performance by up to 60%.",2015 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME),2015,citation

To interconnect such segments, NAT, firewall or similar devices are indispensable in the current Internet. Placing such devices on the Internet unnecessarily complicated the Internet. It is extremely difficult and even impossible to strictly preserve the original end-to-end principle of the Internet. We think that it is still possible to preserve the key feature of the end-to-end principle of the Internet even in the current Internet, by just relaxing this strict principle. To this end, we propose a new Internet architecture, which is called a Virtual IP Layer (VIP) that virtually realizes IP connectivity between hosts that belong to different IP address realms. The virtual IP layer is placed just over the IP layer, and performs the IP address translation in a consistent manner, by applying the label-switching technique to forwarding of IP packets. To verify the feasibility of this architecture, we have applied it to communication between hosts, which belong to different private IPv4 realms, via the global IPv4 address realm (i.e. the Internet), and developed its prototype.","2015 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage (NAS)",2015,citation

In this paper, we propose D-Griffin, a geometric routing scheme on flat names for dynamic topologies. D-Griffin provides two advantages. First, it avoids re-embedding the topology by using an online greedy embedding scheme and a void handling greedy forwarding scheme. Second, it decreases the number of re-registrations by using a name mapping scheme with a tradeoff between topology independence and load balancing.

An ID/Locator split approach in the network layer can efficiently support server/client mobility. Multipath transfer in the transport layer enables fast or fault tolerant content transfer. Existing well-tuned congestion control in the transport layer achieves fairness not only among ICN flows but also among ICN flows and other flows.

Recently Content Centric Network (CCN) is proposed as an alternative of the future network architecture. In CCN, data itself, which is authenticated and secured, is a name and can be directly requested at the network level instead of using IP and Domain Name System (DNS). Another difference between CCN and traditional networks is that the routers in CCN have the caching abilities. Then the end users can obtain the data from routers instead of from the remote server if the content has been stored in the router. Hence the overall network performance can be improved by reducing the required transmission hops and the advantage of the CCN caching has been shown in literature. In this paper, we design a new caching policy for the popularity-aware video caching in CCN to handle the `redundancy' problem in the existing schemes, where the same content may be stored multiple times along the road from server to users, thus leading to a significant performance degradation. Simulations are conducted and we could observe that the proposed scheme performs better comparing with the existing caching policies.","2015 11th International Conference on Heterogeneous Networking for Quality, Reliability, Security and Robustness (QSHINE)",2015,citation

The main contributions of this thesis are twofold. From measurement perspective, we show that the conventional metric hit rate is not sufficient in evaluating a caching strategy on non-trivial topologies, therefore we introduce footprint reduction and coupling factor, which contain richer information. We show cooperation policy is the key in balancing various tradeoffs in caching strategy design, and further investigate the performance impact from content per se via different chunking schemes. From design perspective, we first show different caching heuristics and smart routing schemes can significantly improve the caching performance and facilitate content delivery. We then incorporate well-defined fairness metric into design and derive the unique optimal caching solution on the Pareto boundary with bargaining game framework. In addition, our study on the functional relationship between cooperation overhead and neighborhood size indicates collaboration should be constrained in a small neighborhood due to its cost growing exponentially on general network topologies.",,2015,citation

Such a paradigm allows routers enhanced with content-awareness to play a direct role in the routing and resolution of content requests from users, without any knowledge of the specific locations of hosted content. However, to facilitate good network traffic engineering and satisfactory user QoS, content routers need to exchange advanced network knowledge to assist them with their resolution decisions. In order to maintain the location-independency tenet of ICNs, such knowledge (known as context information) needs to be independent of the locations of servers. To this end, we propose CAINE - Context-Aware Information-centric Network Ecosystem - which enables context-based operations to be intrinsically supported by the underlying ICN routing and resolution functions. Our approach has been designed to maintain the location-independence philosophy of ICNs by associating context information directly to content rather than to the physical entities such as servers and network elements in the content ecosystem, while ensuring scalability.

The inability to exchange data unambiguously between information systems and human resources is an issue that hinders technology implementation, semantic interoperability, service deployment, network management, technology migration, among many others. In this thesis, we will approach the semantic issues in two critical subfields of networking, namely, network configuration management and network addressing architectures. The fact that makes the study in these areas rather appealing is that in both scenarios semantic issues have been around from the very early days of networking. However, as networks continue to grow in size and complexity current practices are becoming neither scalable nor practical. 
One of the most complex and essential tasks in network management is the configuration of network devices. The lack of comprehensive and standard means for modifying and controlling the configuration of network elements has led to the continuous and extended use of proprietary Command Line Interfaces (CLIs). Unfortunately, CLIs are generally both, device and vendor-specific. In the context of heterogeneous network infrastructures---i.e., networks typically composed of multiple devices from different vendors---the use of several CLIs raises serious Operation, Administration and Management (OAM) issues. Accordingly, network administrators are forced to gain specialized expertise and to continuously keep knowledge and skills up to date as new features, system upgrades or technologies appear. Overall, the utilization of proprietary mechanisms allows neither sharing knowledge consistently between vendors' domains nor reusing configurations to achieve full automation of network configuration tasks---which are typically required in autonomic management. Due to this heterogeneity, CLIs typically provide a help feature which is in turn an useful source of knowledge to enable semantic interpretation of a vendor's configuration space. The large amount of information a network administrator must learn and manage makes Information Extraction (IE) and other forms of natural language analysis of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field key enablers for the network device configuration space. This thesis presents the design and implementation specification of the first Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) System from the CLI of network devices for the automation and abstraction of device configurations. Moreover, the so-called semantic overload of IP addresses---wherein addresses are both identifiers and locators of a node at the same time---is one of the main constraints over mobility of network hosts, multi-homing and scalability of the routing system. In light of this, numerous approaches have emerged in an effort to decouple the semantics of the network addressing scheme. In this thesis, we approach this issue from two perspectives, namely, a non-disruptive (i.e., evolutionary) solution to the current Internet and a clean-slate approach for Future Internet. In the first scenario, we analyze the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) as it is currently one of the strongest solutions to the semantic overload issue. However, its adoption is hindered by existing problems in the proposed mapping systems. Herein, we propose the LISP Redundancy Protocol (LRP) aimed to complement the LISP framework and strengthen feasibility of deployment, while at the same time, minimize mapping table size, latency time and maximize reachability in the network. In the second scenario, we explore TARIFA a Next Generation Internet architecture and introduce a novel service-centric addressing scheme which aims to overcome the issues related to routing and semantic overload of IP addresses.",,2015,citation

In this paper, we first formulate the content placement problem and find two key factors, i.e., the content popularity and the content placement benefit. Then we propose a heuristic probability-based caching strategy, called MBP (Max-Benefit Probability-based Caching). In MBP, each cache node caches the passing content with certain probability, which is proportional to the content popularity and the content placement benefit. We evaluate MBP via extensive simulations by comparing it with state-of-art caching strategies under tree and graph topologies. The experimental results indicate that MBP can achieve great improvement compared with other caching strategies, in terms of average cache hit ratio, average access hop ratio, caching operation and link stress.

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the storage available at wireless access points to bring content closer to mobile devices, hence improving the downloading performance. Specifically, we propose to have a separate popularity based cache and a prefetch buffer at the network edge to capture both long-term and short-term content access patterns. Further, we point out that it is insufficient to rely on a device's past history to predict when and where to prefetch, especially in urban settings; instead, we propose to derive a prediction model based on the aggregated network-level statistics. We discuss the proposed mobile content caching/prefetching method in the context of the MobilityFirst future Internet architecture. In MobilityFirst, when mobile clients move between network attachment points (e.g., Wi-Fi access points), their network association records are logged by the network, which then naturally facilitates the network-level mobility prediction. Through detailed simulations with real taxi mobility traces, we show that such a strategy is more effective than earlier schemes in satisfying content requests at the edge (higher cache hit ratios), leading to shorter content download latencies. Specifically, the fraction of requests satisfied at the edge increases by a factor of 2.9 compared to a caching only approach, and by 45% compared to individual user-based prediction and prefetching.","2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)",2015,citation

ICNs are based on three main concepts: content forwarding, in-network caching, and multicasting. To realize these three key concepts, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as an important potential candidate, due to its ability to implement all network intelligence in a reprogrammable device known as the controller. However, the integration of these two networking paradigms presents many challenges. This paper studies these challenges and highlights key areas where more effort is needed from the research community. Particularly, the paper focuses on the architectural modifications necessary to incorporate SDN in ICN architectures, including the necessary modifications to the popular OpenFlow protocol. In addition, the paper studies several implementation challenges arising from the integration of SDN and ICN such as the need for a scalable and distributed SDN control that is highly responsive in meeting dynamic user requests, and the need for a semantic naming scheme for content that provides the users with a large degree of expressiveness in specifying their requests.

As there is a rapid explosion of web-based content, it becomes challenging to provide quality of experience to the end-user. To efficiently handle the utmost growth of the Internet content, in business perspective, there is a clear increase in Content Delivery Networking (CDN). On the other hand, in research perspective it is the Information Centric Networking (ICN) which emerged as an alternative to the current host-to-host communication paradigm and has the potentials of distribution and retrieval of contents more efficiently. This article is an initiative to find some rooms where the ICN and the CDN can meet together. In ICN, a potential strategy by the publisher ignores CDN providers and has direct connections with ISPs. However we believe that, at the stage of incremental deployment of ICN, there is no scope of ignoring CDN. Besides, it is true that it will take time to deploy ICN in Internet scale. So, for achieving big economy of scale publisher will choose CDN as a means for its content distribution. In this paper we present two possible content distribution models for ICN.

The architecture introduces an ICN publish/subscribe communication approach to the wavelength layer; whereby, content is aggregated according to its popularity rank into wavelength-size groups that can be published and ""subscribed to"" by multiple nodes. Consequently, routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithms benefit from anycast to identify multiple sources of aggregate content and allow optimization of the source selection of light-paths. A power-aware algorithm, Maximum Degree of connectivity (MaxDeg), has been developed with the objective of exploiting this flexibility to address the trade-off between power consumption and network performance. The algorithm is also applicable to IP architectures, albeit with less flexibility. Evaluation results indicate the superiority of the proposed ICN architecture, even when utilizing conventional routing methods, compared to its IP counterpart. The results further highlight the performance improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm, compared to conventional RWA methods such as Shortest-path First Fit (SFF).",ArXiv,2015,citation

Named Data Networking (NDN) is considered as a candidate of next-generation Internet architectures. In NDN, an addressable content name, rather than an IP address, is used to publish, request, deliver and manage the content. In addition, NDN employs router caches to replicate and store passing packets, so that previously requested contents can be delivered very quickly. Although router caching can improve network throughput significantly, it also introduces a few serious privacy problems. In this paper, we focus on studying snooping attack, in which a snooper can learn about other users' preferences and breach their privacy by measuring the time difference between responses. To address this problem, we utilize the signatures of abnormal events to detect abnormal user behaviors, and build a credit score for each user according to his behaviors. When the credit score of a user drops below a predefined threshold, this user is considered as a snooper. Then, we deliberately add a response delay to the snooper so that he can be isolated from normal users. The performance analysis shows that our scheme can efficiently protect router caching privacy against snooping attack, with keeping high network performance.",2015 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC),2015,citation

It is not proper to analyze a cache node isolated from cache neighbors, especially for the named data network in which all network nodes can cache the content. In this paper, we try to look insight into such an issue and propose a way of cache collaboration not only for the on-path but also for the off-path routers. The autonomous cache is not efficient and cache routers are required to guarantee the time of the cached content for the stability as well as the reliability. Therefore, we firstly introduce an interest counter, on one hand, to rank different contents within a period, in this way, we can use the advantage of the least frequently used LFU as well as avoid its cache pollution problem, on the other hand, to reduce the rate of content replacement and to maintain a relative stability in forwarding plane, thus, the cached content can be easily managed by the control plane. Secondly, we utilize the interest-prune and the steady content advertisement mechanism in the control plane based on the interest counter in order to eliminate the duplicated cached content along en-route routers and cache neighbors, as a result, more cache capacity for different contents can be saved and efficient cache collaboration can be obtained. We evaluate the performance of our scheme in line, tree and grid topology scenarios. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well compared with the perfect-LFU, the LFU, the random, and least recently used replacement policies.

End users expect to access video content, regardless of their device, connection type and location. On the other hand, content providers set strict security requirements regarding the protection of their content, making up an overall difficult and challenging context for Over-the-Top service providers. A miscellany of proprietary approaches tries to address these issues, providing, however, only partial solutions, and composing a domain, highly fragmented by non-interoperable products. In this paper, we propose an architecture that utilises Information-Centric Networking ICN in order to provide scalable and efficient video distribution, and Attribute-Based Encryption ABE to securely distribute this content in the ICN environment. ABE is incorporated into Digital Rights Management DRM schemes. We present the video license acquisition process, with a focus on orchestrating multiple authorities; subsequently, the video distribution over ICN is demonstrated, and finally, we investigate user revocation techniques in the ABE and ICN context and adopt the most appropriate one.

However users should be able to maintain full control over their own content. For this purpose, we propose WARP, an architecture based upon Information-Centric Networking (ICN) designs, which expands the scope of the ICN architecture beyond media distribution, to provide data control in social networks. The benefit of our solution lies in the lightweight nature of the protocol and in its layered design. With WARP, data distribution and access policies are enforced on the user side. Data can still be replicated in an ICN fashion but we introduce control channels, named thread updates, which ensures that the access to the data is always updated to the latest control policy. WARP decentralizes the social network but still offers APIs so that social network providers can build products and business models on top of WARP. Social applications run directly on the user's device and store their data on the user's butler that takes care of encryption and distribution. Moreover, users can still rely on third parties to have high-availability without renouncing their privacy.",2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS),2013,citation

In this work, we instead design a distributed cost-aware scheme that explicitly considers the cost heterogeneity among different links. We contrast our scheme with both traditional cost-blind schemes and optimal results. We further propose an architectural design to let multiple schemes be interoperable, and finally assess whether overlooking implementation details could hamper the practical relevance of our design.

Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an instance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet architecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network, NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution and for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry applications that dominate today's Internet.
 One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to distributing fake (aka ""poisoned"") content. However, in practice, this poses two challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to signature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust context, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which content. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content signatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning attacks.
 This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning attacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation of content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management architecture, elements of which we construct, while carefully justifying specific design choices. This work represents the initial effort towards comprehensive trust management for NDN.",CCRV,2014,citation

The main issue is scalability. Traditional IP routing can be used with name prefixes, but it is believed that the number of prefixes will grow too large. A related problem is the use of per-packet in-network state (to cut loops and return data to consumers). We develop a routing scheme that solves these problems. The service model of our informationcentric network supports information pull and push using tag sets as information descriptors. Within this service model, we propose a routing scheme that supports forwarding along multiple loop-free paths, aggregates addresses for scalability, does not require per-packet network state, and leads to near-optimal paths on average. We evaluate the scalability of our routing scheme, both in terms of memory and computational complexity, on the full Internet AS-level topology and on the internal networks of representative ASes using realistic distributions of content and users extrapolated from traces of popular applications. For example, a population of 500 million users requires a routing information base of 3.8GB with an almost flat growth and, in this case, a routing update (one content descriptor) can be processed in less than 5ms on commodity hardware. We conclude that information-centric networking is feasible, even with (or perhaps thanks to) addresses consisting of expressive content descriptors.

During the content delivery from sources to destinations, the data contents are cached to intermediate nodes in order to achieve efficient and reliable distribution of the data content among the network infrastructure (in-network caching). In this research project we focus on the efficiency of ICN for delivering Big Data with Persistent Identifiers. We proposed a Mapping Architecture for resolving PIDs to ICN names and we evaluate the efficiency of in-network caching when delivering Big Data objects.

A key supporting technology behind these services is a scalable, intelligent and effective anycast service. Present anycast solutions are either based on route-by-name or lookup-by-name, which cannot fulfill the requirements of today's services. In this paper, we first propose an anycast network architecture that combines the merits of both the route-by-name and lookup-by-name schemes, which achieves good balance between routing scalability and forwarding efficiency, allows flexible server selection, quickly adapts to network changes and maintains flow affinity. Based on this architecture, practical anycast-based server selection algorithms are presented with joint considerations of both network condition and server load condition. The proposed algorithms are evaluated through the discrete event network simulations using OMNET++ and the INET framework. Experiment results show that efficient server selection can be achieved.

ISPs, content providers and other third parties have widely deployed content delivery networks (CDNs) to support digital content distribution. Though CDN is an ad-hoc solution to the content dissemination problem, there are still big challenges, such as complicated control plane. By contrast, as a wholly new designed network architecture, named data networking (NDN) incorporates content delivery function in its network layer, its stateful routing and forwarding plane can effectively detect and adapt to the dynamic and ever-changing Internet. In this paper, we try to explore the similarities and differences between CDN and NDN. Hence, we evaluate the distribution efficiency, network security and protocol overhead between CDN and NDN. Especially in the implementation phase, we conduct their testbeds separately with the same topology to derive their performance of content delivery. Finally, summarizing our main results, we gather that: 1) NDN has its own advantage on lots of aspects, including security, scalability and quality of service (QoS); 2) NDN make full use of surrounding resources and is more adaptive to the dynamic and ever-changing Internet; 3) though CDN is a commercial and mature architecture, in some scenarios, NDN can perform better than CDN under the same topology and caching storage. In a word, NDN is practical to play an even greater role in the evolution of the Internet based on the massive distribution and retrieval in the future.","2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",2014,citation

Most of existing ITS techniques are not applicable in developing regions because of chaotic traffic conditions in developing countries. Hence, it is desirable to develop ITS techniques for developing regions, enabling coordinated and informed use of transportation infrastructure. This report describes an approach which aims at providing such techniques by crowdsourcing over smartphones. Our approach aims at providing realtime information about road traffic congestion and public transportation systems. Such information can enable coordinated use of existing transportation infrastructure and thus, might help in alleviating the issue of road traffic congestion. Our approach collects information about users’ location and travel activity through the use of smartphone sensors, and a quick, easy to use interactive application. Such information, crowdsourced over a large number of smartphones, can give us realtime information about road traffic congestion and transit vehicles of public transportation systems. This realtime information can help users of private vehicles to plan their travel as per road traffic congestion, and make it easy for commuters to use public transportation systems. Communication framework of our approach is content centric as the smartphone users, publishing or seeking information, worry only about the content, and not about the origin or potential users of information.

Routing protocols adopting destination-based routing tables introduce large overhead to maintain the routing tables in wireless networks. Many routing protocols cause flooding in updating and finding routes when topology changes. In information centric network (ICN), prior content routing approaches assume that the entire ICN use the same naming space for named data objects (NDO) and that routing tables list routes to NDOs or name prefixes, which incurs more overhead than routing to address ranges.In this thesis we present novel approaches to build a new hierarchy for routing in computer communication networks which collaborates information dissemination in networks with publish-subscribe mechanisms, network storage, scalable routing and social networks. We propose a few hierarchical, scale-free routing schemes which scale well with network size. In contrast to prior approaches to disseminate information through wireless networks over routing tables, our approaches exploit the social plane exiting in the wireless network to improve the efficiency to deliver information and eliminates the use of destination-based routing tables. In addition, different from prior works in adopting social networks into wireless networks that focus on physical aspects of connectivity over time, our approaches emphasize on the underlying social information among the wireless networks to analyze nodes potential delivery capability and efficiently utilize network storage resources. We also design novel use of Dominating Sets for improving the problems of broadcasting, information query and storage, topology management, and routing in MANETs and ICNs. Our new approaches allow distance-vector routing to scale by integrating it with adaptive publish-subscribe mechanisms.

For example, conventional ICN techniques do not work well in the intermittent VANET connectivity. Moreover, current ICN proposal strictly follows a receiver-driven transport design. However, many applications in multi-hop adhoc networks are push-based and require fast communications. ICN's pull-based transport in such cases is underperforming and costly. Finally, the inefficiency introduced by ICN default anycast may backfire without careful design.

In ICN architecture, the data are cached or stored at intermediate routers to satisfy future demands locally without repeatedly getting it from the original source. For ICN architecture to work efficiently, caching policies must be defined such that most of the requests are satisfied locally. In this paper, we propose Universal Caching, a novel caching algorithm which takes into account multiple parameters like distance from the content source, frequency of fetching the content, number of outgoing links at the intermediate router. We further propose a discrete time Markov model and entropy-based analysis to determine the cache size for a given cache hit requirement at a router in ICN networks. We have also established that Universal Caching policy is in fact an optimal caching policy and have calculated the bounds for the same as well. To validate the proposed caching policy and the analytical model, we have conducted extensive MATLAB-based simulations. Our simulation results show that the Universal Caching outperforms other caching policies like Least Recently Used, First In, First Out in terms of cache hits, access delay, etc.",2014 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS),2014,citation

While renewable energy-aware data centers have been proposed, these solutions have certain limitations. The primary limitation is due to the design of data centers which focus on large-size facilities located in selected locations. This paper addresses this problem, by utilizing in-network caching with each router having storage and being powered by renewable energy sources (wind and solar). Besides placing contents closer to end users, utilizing in-network caching could potentially increase probability of capturing renewable energy in diverse geographical locations. Our proposed solution is dual- layered: on the first layer a distributed gradient-based routing protocol is used to discover the paths along routers that are powered by the highest renewable energy, and on the second layer, a caching mechanism will pull the contents from the data centre and place them on routers of the paths that are discovered by our routing protocol. Through our experiments on a testbed utilizing real meteorological data, our proposed solution has demonstrated increased quantity of renewable energy consumption, while reducing the workload on the data centers.",,2014,citation

To solve this problem, we propose various query forwarding approaches under deterministic and probabilistic expertise models.

However, because nodes receiving requested contents through CCN cannot recognize real senders of the received contents, the receivers need to verify each received contents before using them. But such a verification procedure can cause long service/operation delay. Hence, in this paper, we review the problem of contents verification, propose an improved verification procedure and evaluate its performance. ※ 본 연구는 2013년도 정부의 재원으로 한국연구재단의 지원을 받아 수행된 연구 결과임 (No. NRF-2013R1A1A2008389). ° First Author and Corresponding Author : Suwon University, Department of Information Security, daeyoub69@suwon.ac.kr, 정회원 * 수원대학교 정보보호학과, jaesungpark@suwon.ac.kr, 종신회원 논문번호:KICS2014-04-117, Received April 7, 2014; Revised April 17, 2014; Accepted April 17, 2014 I. 서 론 현재 인터넷이 직면하고 있는 다양한 문제점들을 해결하고, 인터넷을 통한 멀티미디어 콘텐츠 서비스의 급속한 증가에 효과적으로 대응하기 위하여 다양한 미래 인터넷 기술 연구가 진행되고 있다 . 특히, 콘 텐츠 제공자에게 집중되는 네트워크 트래픽 (Network Traffic)으로 인해 발생되는 네트워크 병목 현상을 해 결하고, 대용량 멀티미디어 콘텐츠를 효과적으로 배포 하기 위하여 많은 미래 인터넷 기술들은 콘텐츠 전송 시, 다른 사용자들에 의해 이전에 요청되어져서 이미 배포된 콘텐츠들(Content Replica)을 네트워킹에 적극 적으로 활용하는 방안을 고려하고 있다.

This growth has resulted in an increasing demand for information identification as well as information-based communication functions that can meet this evolution. Consequently, information-centric networking envisions a shift in the future Internet communication paradigm from relying on the notion of an end node toward making information itself the primary object. This is realized by adopting information as the primary identifier of a user's demand. With this new concept in networking, new (information- focused) solutions can be developed to conventional problems found in IP networks, such as resilient content delivery. In this article we introduce a novel resiliency solution that goes beyond the scope of path recovery to tackle source failure scenarios in order to achieve the more general form of information resilience. We show that by utilizing the knowledge of information, offered by a publish/subscribe information-centric networking model, multiple publishers of a single information item can be natively identified, thereby allowing for recovery of the delivery process using alternative publishers should a publisher fail.",IEEE Network,2014,citation

ICN focuses on content handling and distribution rather than host-to-host communications. Satellite systems have always played a key role in content distribution, and therefore, they are expected to be fundamental components of the ICN. However, it is not obvious whether solutions that are being developed for terrestrial ICNs are effective in satellite scenarios as well. More specifically, the focus of this paper is on in-network content caching, which is an important feature characterising all ICN proposals but, as we will show, should be redesigned to address the specific characteristics of satellite networks. Indeed, in this paper, a novel caching scheme named SatCache is proposed, which exploits the broadcast nature of the satellite communication medium and creates a profile of the preferences of network users in order to estimate their potential interest in a given content. The proposed approach is based on a simple model of the user behaviour. By aggregating the content requests generated by a large number of users, a collective behaviour can be observed, which fits the output of large measurement campaigns discussed in the literature. Simulation results given in the paper show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Trans. Emerg. Telecommun. Technol.,2014,citation

The search order can be dynamically adjusted as the forwarding table changes. Second, we propose a new near-perfect hash table data structure that combines many small sparse perfect hash tables into a larger dense one while keeping the worst-case access time of O(1) and supporting fast update.

Several solutions for this threat have been introduced, but they do not solve the problem in a satisfying way because of some drawbacks in either their detection performance, scalability support or restricted scenario of usage. Our goal is to design a reliable, low resources-consuming detection method against Interest flooding attack in CCN. A detection scheme must be attended since a lot of resources consumed by unnecessarily continuous countermeasure can be saved by a dependable detector. Like no other detectors in proposed solutions, our detector is based on statistical hypotheses testing theory. The achieved result is a low resources-consuming detector that can be deployed globally on each CCN router. The false alarm probability of our detector can be controlled at will.

Recently, ICN is also studied for mobile ad-hoc networks environments for efficient content distribution.

In this paper, we raise questions about this research direction by analyzing the performance of reliability and energy efficiency of both broadcast and unicast delivery schemes, and show that unicast delivery outperforms broadcast delivery, unless packet flooding overhead for finding a new end-to-end path is quite large. Based on this observation, we present a novel energy efficient content distribution scheme that minimizes flooding overhead by taking advantage of ICN features.

By means of the status information about the nodes and the TTL values of the queries,it can improve the search performance both in the aspect of data’s search scope and network efficiency.

In-network caching is an important issue in ICN, since the routers have a limited caching capacity. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cache redundancy, and increase the cache hit ratio and the user delay. Most approaches design algorithms for single routers, and there are still redundant caches in an AS. In this paper, we propose the content-hierarchical Intra-Domain Cooperative Caching (IDCC) scheme to solve the problem, based on the observation that the time of access contents within the local AS is much shorter than that of access contents outside. We use probabilistic caching based on inlet traffic speed, and avoid unnecessary replicas by intra-domain cooperation based on content advertisements. We use hierarchical caching based on content popularity to improve the performance. Our scheme is different from other intra-domain cooperation schemes which remove redundant replicas after contents have been cached. We evaluate our scheme with simulations. The results show that IDCC can improve the hit ratio by 1.7 times and 1.1 times compared to two common existing schemes, respectively.",CFI '14,2014,citation

The modeling of CCN as an important research point is the foundation of the architecture. The past work of cache network modeling always assumes the virtual round trip time (VRTT) is zero for simplicity. However, this assumption isn't practical and results in model error especially in CCN. CCN's router can aggregate the content requests during the VRTT to avoid content delivery repeatedly. Thus, to modeling CCN data transfer, as well as understanding how it should be managed, the VRTT shouldn't be ignored. In this paper, we model the data transfer in CCN, and propose a multi-cache with aggregation approximation (MCAA) algorithm to get the content miss rate and VRTT at each router.

In particular, to efficiently search nearby resources among many and various ones in the platform, we propose Resource Breadcrumbs(RBC) as a key technology to provide in-network guidance capability autonomously for users' requests. This enables to supply users a smaller unit of resources: computing resource, memory resource, content, application etc. in comparison to traditional IaaS service. In the proposal, supplier-nodes distribute, around them, guidance information directed to themselves with dedicated control message, and additionally, the information may be logged along the trail of ACK message from central database server or supplier to user.

information and services. The more powerful these devices get, the more likely it is that they will generate and share content locally, leading to the presence of distributed information sources and the diminishing role of centralized servers. 
 
As of current practice, we rely on infrastructure acting as an intermediary, providing access to the data. However, infrastructure-based connectivity might not always be available or the best alternative. Moreover, it is often the case where the data and the processes acting upon them are of local scopus. Answers to a query about a nearby object, an information source, a process, an experience, an ability, etc. could be answered locally without reliance on infrastructure-based platforms. The data might have temporal validity limited to or bounded to a geographical 
area and/or the social context where the user is immersed in. 
 
In this envisioned scenario users could interact locally without the need for a central authority, hence, the claim of an infrastructure-less, provider-less platform. The data is owned by the users and consulted locally as opposed to the current approach of making them available globally 
and stay on forever. From a technical viewpoint, this network resembles a Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network where consumers and producers might be spatially and temporally decoupled exchanging information with each other in an adhoc fashion. 
 
To this end, we propose some novel data gathering and dissemination strategies for use in urban-wide environments which do not rely on strict infrastructure mediation.

Therefore,based on related contents attracting,a related contents attracting algorithm is proposed. With the effect of attracting similar contents cached in other near nodes,for the purpose of apparently stable featured contents of nodes cached,the algorithm attracts major characteristic contents,rejects secondary feature contents,and enlarges the difference of different characteristic content. It also gathers the related contents on the same nodes via the mutual attraction with same contents feature,which facilitates the cache contents feature abstraction. Meanwhile,the strategy of lifetime increasement between contents with main feature is designed to deduce the routing advertisement and improve the routing scalability. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the update frequency of cache content,and improve the routing reliability. 【Key words】 Content Delivery Network(CDN);cache algorithm;contents attracting;cache factor;cache redundancy; routing",,2014,citation

Therefore, ICN may naturally overcome many of the cumbersome fixes and limitations of today's solutions. In this work, we exploit the flexibility in semantic representation offered by ICN to present a flexible and scalable ICN-based QoS model. Our model defines QoS requirements as information items that can be linked to the content at various aggregation levels, independent of the communication approach.

To bridging content and IP, lots of augmented technologies, such as DHT, tracker, DNS, search engines, and so on, are required. This paper attempts to shifts routing from host-centric to content-centric to meet the current dominating applications and also improve the performance of content retrieval and dissemination for mobile Ad Hoc Networks. We utilize the identifier guided routing concept to reduce router overheads and enhance the efficiency of routers. Moreover, the semantic of an ID is no longer restricted to a host and its location; rich meanings such as person, thing, host, content etc. are able to give instead. The proposed routing, denoted as Rich Semantic Content-oriented Routing (RSCR), builds routes by rendezvousing of proactive content table dissemination and on-demand route discovery. The RSCR is a light-loaded and scalable routing protocol by utilizing local, aggregated and control-loaded broadcasting for content table dissemination. Simulation results reveal that the distribution costs are significantly reduced and the routing performance in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, route length, route successful connecting ratio, route discovery delay, and costs are improved.",The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014),2014,citation

Multicast holds out great promise to significantly reduce network load between the sender and a group of receivers by delivering a single data stream to many recipients. Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode and its variant PIM Source-Specific Multicast (PIM SSM) are the most widely used IP multicast protocols. Protocols offer low latency data delivery capabilities with relatively high reliability and are characterized by large signaling overhead. This article presents a new multicast protocol, called Lightweight PIM (LPIM), tackling the main problem hindering widespread usage of IP multicast protocols, which is a large volume of signaling traffic. Given the existing usability of the PIM family protocols, a decision was made to base the new LPIM protocol on PIM SSM. The improvements used in LPIM lead to a considerable reduction of state data and signaling messages required by LPIM as compared with PIM SSM. Similar to its predecessor, LPIM is capable of handling large groups, although with significantly lower overhead. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Int. J. Commun. Syst.,2014,citation

In this paper we show that there is a tradeoff between two common caching metrics, byte hit rate and footprint reduction, and show that a cooperation policy can adjust this tradeoff. We model the cooperation policy with only two parameters - search radius r and number of copies in the network K. These two parameters represent the range of cooperation and tolerance of duplicates. We show how cooperation policy impacts content distribution, and further illustrate the relation between content popularity and topological properties.

Instead of knowing the IP address of the communicating party, ICN focuses on the data, i.e. content, transmitted in network. Therefore, how to locate and access the desired content is a crucial issue in ICN. Some existing solutions aim at resolving the content name through a name resolution service, which is similar to the DNS services of Internet. Other solutions are based on route-by-name scheme, which treats content names similar to existing routing protocols using IP addresses. Since the content can be cached in various data storage, it is difficult to enforce content access control policies on various content hosting servers. As a result, using Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a flexible approach to enforce the content access policies regardless the security mechanisms provided by different content hosting servers. However, using ABE has a drawback that the enforced content access policies are known to all the ICN users. It is desirable that only legitimated content viewers are able to reveal the content access policies. To this end, a privacy-preserving content access control scheme is presented in this research for ICN. The presented scheme is compatible with existing flat name based ICN architectures.",,2014,citation

Thus, mitigating faults at various layers is essential in ensuring efficient and fair network resource utilization. In this thesis we take a step in this direction and study several ways to deal with faults by means of penalties and revocation mechanisms in networks that are lacking a centralized coordination point, either because of their scale or design. Compromised nodes can pose a serious threat to infrastructure, end-hosts and services. Such malicious elements can undermine the availability and fairness of networked systems. To deal with such nodes, we design and analyze protocols enabling their removal from the network in a fast and a secure way. We design these protocols for two different environments. In the former setting, we assume that there are multiple, but independent trusted points in the network which coordinate other nodes in the network. In the latter, we assume that all nodes play equal roles in the network and thus need to cooperate to carry out common functionality. We analyze these solutions and discuss possible deployment scenarios. Next we turn our attention to wireless edge networks. In this context, some nodes, without being malicious, can still behave in an unfair manner. To deal with the situation, we propose several self-penalty mechanisms. We implement the proposed protocols employing a commodity hardware and conduct experiments in real-world environments. The analysis of data collected in several measurement rounds revealed improvements in terms of higher fairness and throughput. We corroborate the results with simulations and an analytic model. And finally, we discuss how to measure fairness in dynamic settings, where nodes can have heterogeneous resource demands.",,2014,citation

In this paper we qualitatively compared the different schemes regarding hop counts and node transaction load and discuss possible measures for quantitatively comparing different schemes of ICN.

This paper focuses on how to detect and mitigate the Interest flooding attack (IFA) in NDN, which can excessively consume the resource of each involved router by flooding too many malicious Interest packets with fake names. In this paper, to counter IFA, an architecture called Cooperative-Filter is proposed. It detects IFA using fuzzy logic, and mitigates it based on the cooperation between routers at the granularity of per-prefix-per-interface, by taking advantages of the state statistics of each router. Moreover, the performance of Cooperative-Filter is evaluated, based on both effect of it on reducing memory resource consumption of each involved router and the effect on increasing Interest satisfaction rate for legitimate users when suffering IFA as well as on decreasing the Interest-retrieving delay. Simulation results demonstrate that Cooperative-Filter can detect IFA and effectively mitigate its damage effect on NDN.

In typical designs, however, application of each thing is restricted to a dedicated use case in a single network of connected devices, resulting in a closed loop of information flow. We argue that, given the envisioned diversity, capabilities, and sheer number of smart things, this obstructs the possibility of creating diverse and exciting applications that benefit of the generated information in public, global usage scenarios. In this paper, we thus aim to initiate the discussion of creating a true Internet of Things, i.e., interconnected IoT networks, based on provision and requests of generated information in a public infrastructure. We highlight the challenges in designing this infrastructure for feasible integration in the current Internet and IoT designs, comprehensive provision and retrieval of information, and versatile derivation of higher information contexts from single information sources. Assessing advantages and shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose a suitable approach and discuss both a centralized and distributed implementation of the proposed infrastructure.","2013 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communications and Networking (SECON)",2013,citation

The system creates a pointer space to build on top of standard DHTs. Mappings within the pointer space are (Endpoint Identifiers (EID), pointers) where the pointer is the address of the root node (the physical node that stores the mappings) of the corresponding (EID, Routing Locators (RLOCs)) mappings. In addition to enabling architectural qualities such as scalability and reliability, the proposed LISP-PCHORD can copy with flat EIDs such as self-certifying EIDs. The performance of the mapping system plays a key role in LISP; however, DHT-based approaches for LISP seldom consider the mismatch problem that heavily damages the system performance in terms of lookup latency. In order to mitigate the mismatch problem and achieve optimal performance, we propose an optimization design method that seeks an optimal matching relationship between P-nodes (nodes within the pointer space) and the physical nodes on the basis of the given lookup traffic matrix. In order to find the optimal matching relationship, we provide two solutions: a linear programming method and a genetic algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and compare it with that of LISP-DHT.",China Communications,2013,citation

NDN retains the same hourglass shape as the IP architecture, but changes the narrow waist from delivery of IP packets to destinations to the retrieval of named and signed data chunks. This conceptually simple change allows NDN networks to use almost all the Internet's well-tested engineering properties to solve not only communication problems, but also digital distribution and control problems. The functionality of the narrow waist in NDN is fundamentally different from that in IP: it uses consumer-driven data delivery with a stateful data forwarding plane, implements built-in data security, and provides support for the extensive use of in-network storage. Preliminary experience shows that NDN bridges the gap between applications and network transport, simultaneously simplifying the application development process and addressing some of the Internet's most pressing problems in security, scalability, and sustainability. At the same time, the realization of the NDN architecture faces a number of brand new challenges. For example, all data packets must be signed by the original producers and verified by their consumers, bringing up the need for providing secure, resilient, and scalable support for public key distributions. Furthermore, since NDN eliminates the translation from application names to IP addresses and routes consumer data requests using application data names directly, maintaining the scalability of the global routing system becomes another challenge. This dissertation addresses the above challenges in moving NDN from an architecture blueprint to the operational reality. We designed and implemented a prototype of NDNS, a completely distributed database system that largely mimics the structure of the DNS system in today's Internet but operates within the NDN architecture. We show how NDNS can be used for cryptographic key distribution and routing scalability management. We believe that NDNS can also serve a number of other purposes during the development and deployment of the NDN architecture in coming years.",,2013,citation

A 0-1 ILP (integer linear programming) is used to formulate whether to cache the coming content or not and eviction objects simultaneously. Also, a near-optimal heuristic algorithm is proposed to find profit-efficient cache decision, which can be quickly deployed.

The current network architecture lacks support for lateral sharing of this critical content. Content is currently accessed from known servers and may require reach-back over bandwidth-constrained links. In this work we present SCALE, a Scalable Content-centric Architecture ensuring Locality and Efficiency. SCALE focuses on sharing data as it is created and is optimized for ad hoc collections of mobile nodes, rather than defined clients and servers. Any node can create and share content and nodes can discover content without knowing ahead of time where to look for it. SCALE provides mechanisms by which content is replicated throughout the network by organically caching content as it transits through the network or prepopulating content caches for existing content. SCALE provides a distributed index based on multi-node resolution, in which nodes dynamically take on responsibility for subsets of the content index based solely on being in a particular geographic location. We provide an evaluation of SCALE's mechanisms for providing local content discovery and sharing based on a SCALE prototype running on Android devices. These results show that SCALE can improve the probability that content is available locally and decrease the number of hops needed to access content.

In-network caching is one of the key functionality to be provided by ICN nodes. To avoid network nodes caching fake contents, it is necessary to verify the validity of data items. A content is deemed to be valid if it verifies three properties: i) integrity: it has not be modified; ii) provenance: it comes from the intended source; iii) relevance: it is indeed the content requested from the user (by using the name of that content). In this paper, we discuss the interplay among three pivotal ICN aspects: caching, validity and naming. Specifically, we will investigate different naming and digital signature schemes, evaluating their speed, overhead and their impact on caching performance.

As the technology keeps evolving, user expectations for more challenging cases that can benefit from advanced information and communication technologies are increasing, e.g., the scenario of Integrated Operations (IO) for ships in the maritime domain. However, to realize integrated operations for ships is a complex task that involves addressing problems such as interoperability among heterogeneous operation applications and connectivity within harsh maritime communication environments. The common approach was to tackle these challenges separately by service integration and communication integration, respectively: each utilizes optimized and independent implementations. Separate solutions work fine within their own contexts, whereas conflicts and inconsistencies can be identified by integrating them together for specific maritime scenarios. Therefore, connection between separate solutions needs to be studied. In this dissertation, we first take a look at complex systems to obtain useful methodologies applied to integrated operations for ships. Then we study IO of ships from different perspectives and divide the complex task into sub-tasks. We explore separate approaches to these sub-tasks, examine the connection in between, resolve inconsistencies if there are any, and continue the exploration process till a compatible and integrated solution can be accomplished. In general, this journey represents our argument for an integration-oriented complex system development approach. In concrete, it shows the way on how to achieve IO of ships by both providing connectivity in harsh communication environments and allowing interoperability among heterogeneous operation applications, and most importantly by ensuring the synergy in between.

It also incorporates some basic security features that mitigate classes of attacks that are commonly seen today. However, NDN's resilience to DoS attacks has not been analyzed to-date. This paper represents a first step towards assessment and possible mitigation of DoS in NDN. After identifying and analyzing several new types of attacks, it investigates their variations, effects and counter-measures. This paper also sheds some light on the debate about relative virtues of self-certifying, as opposed to human-readable, names in the context of content-centric networking.",2013 22nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),2012,citation

Therefore, the problem of information overload and big data becomes inherent. In this paper we intend to propose a methodology aiming at a lower processing overhead towards an energy efficient method for networking of information in larger systems. We consider a content-centric networking paradigm that is aimed at enhancing the dissemination of information and eliminating many problems of host based communication. The proposed method is based on a network coding approach which leverages the spectral characteristics of network topology. We argue that topology of interacting nodes within a cluster can influence the performance of network coding from a computational complexity perspective and therefore the overall energy consumption in a system. We propose an algorithm that takes an opportunistic strategy to utilize the social structure and spectral characteristics of the network topology based on our design of a multicast coding network that reduces the number of encoding nodes.",2013 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon),2013,citation

Abstract Named Data Network (NDN) is gaining increasingly concerns, as an important direction of the future Internet architecture research centered on content. Content caching has played a key role in NDN. Existing cache replacement policies like Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Least Recently Used (LRU) have failed to make full use of the popularity of contents, which leads to a low cache efficiency in the dynamic network. In order to make the best use of content popularity in the cache strategy, this paper has proposed a cache replacement policy based on content popularity (CCP), and designed the data structure format and replacement algorithm. For fully studying and analyzing the performance of different cache policies in NDN in terms of network throughput, server load and cache hit ratio, we have done a lot of simulations to show how they will improve the network. The simulation results show that our proposed CCP can significantly decrease the server load with a higher cache hit ratio and increase the network capacity at the same time compared with LRU and LFU. And the average throughput is reduced significantly by nearly 47% in comparison to that of the case without in-networking caching. Moreover, it also shows the performance under different sizes of content store. The effectiveness of the CCP strategy is proved during the simulation.

As an outcome, millions of users are constantly exchanging an enormous amount of information. Such a massive distribution of information and fast increase of traffic loads have posed a considerable challenge to the functionality of the current Internet. Furthermore, apart from increased communication demands and higher loads of exchanged data, the users’ interests have significantly changed. Users primarily focus on finding or sharing specific information, regardless of the particular end host providing it. Thus, the current network architecture appears to be suboptimal, and perhaps even inflexible to follow the changes in communication patterns. In order to support the emerging user requirements, different overlay data delivery structures have been proposed and implemented. Despite the perceived simplicity of such overlay approaches there are many issues, e.g., efficient resource allocation, which are considered to be suboptimal and not desirable as an architectural solution for information exchange over the Internet. Thus, it is believed that apart from overlay techniques additional powerful mechanisms are still necessary for exploiting the network resources effectively. This thesis identifies information-centric communication as a new concept for efficient exploitation of network resources, solving the current Internet problems, and satisfying the emerging user demands. We carefully study the potential of information-centric communication based on the numerous scenarios found in the literature and adopt the most promising solutions as the framework for building our work upon. In this thesis we focus on developing the mechanism for native support of information-centric communication at all networking layers. Having flexibility as one of the most important requirements, we aim at building a set of information-centric helper functions, each being responsible for a small portion of network functionality. A joint operation of such helper functions leads to significant improvement of network performance without increasing the complexity of network operation. We design, implement and carefully evaluate a variety of helper functions entirely relying on information-centric concepts, carrying out the experiments through both extensive simulations and real testbed environments. We particularly focus on helper functions for the control and management plane. We design and build the modules responsible for topology discovery and creation, topology maintenance and mobility management, extending our helper",,2013,citation

On the other hand, the VISION Cloud must provide adequate means of an API for allowing the efficient navigation, search, and access for the right data item in this storage.

It is shown that for the general class of cost measures where the cost of retrieving data is increasing with the distance between client and caches, coded allocation outperforms uncoded allocation.

The increasing use of mobile devices (e.g. smart phones, tablets, etc.) has increased the complexity in provisioning cellular network resources. Applying cloud computing model in LTE systems could be a good solution to increase LTE’s performance by building a shared distributed LTE mobile network that can optimize the utilization of resources, minimize communication delays, and avoid bottlenecks. 
One of the most important concepts used in mobile networks is service continuity. Mobile users moving from one sub-network to another sub-network should be able to seamlessly continue retrieving content and use services (e.g. video streaming, gamming, VoIP, etc.) that they want. In cloud based LTE systems, services are hosted on Virtual Machines (VMs) that can move and migrate across multiple networks to locations that are the best to deliver services to mobile users. The migration of VMs and/or service/functionality instances running on such VMs should happen without losing service continuity. 
In this thesis, Content Centric Networking (CCN) is evaluated and verified whether it is possible to be implemented in cloud based LTE systems as a solution for service continuity. Several integration options of CCN in LTE systems and the proposed solutions to support VM and/or content migration are described in detail. Two sets of experiments that focus on “Content Migration Support” and “VM and Content Migration Support” are implemented and performed using ns-3 LENA simulation environment together with ndnSIM. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can support seamless service continuity when content migration occurs. However, in order to support service continuity when VM migration occurs, the implementation of solutions such as mobility prediction systems are needed to predict the movement of users and determine when the VM migration should be triggered in advance.",,2013,citation

However there is lack of theoretical foundations and quantitative models to evaluate different design choices and compare their respective advantages. In this paper, we take an initial step to build a quantitative framework to enable characterization and comparison of two popular classes of ICN name-oriented routing and resolution techniques, flooding and distributed hash table (DHT). Our results indicate that the interaction of several factors such as network size, content location dynamics and content popularity contributes to the performance of the routing and resolution mechanisms. Especially we obtain a quantitative expression to determine under what conditions one approach yields superior performance over the other. It also suggests that a hybrid DHT-flooding mechanism may perform better although the actual design of such a hybrid protocol is out of the scope of this paper. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of variable-length names and obtain an expression for the optimal name length assigned to a content object. Finally, we present another application of our model, determining when the name aggregation in content location publishing can reduce control overhead and improve scalability. Our modeling and analysis results reveal valuable insights regarding design tradeoffs and provide design guidelines.",2013 22nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN),2013,citation

However, previous works argue that the performance of in-network caching is highly degraded with the current cache-along-default-path design, which makes popular objects to be cached redundantly in many places. Thus, it would be beneficial to have a distributed and uncoordinated design. Although cooperative caches could be an answer to this, previous research showed that they are generally unfeasible due to excessive signaling burden, protocol complexity, and a need for fault tolerance. In this work we illustrate the ICN caching problem, and propose a novel architecture to overcome the problem of uncooperative caches. Our design possesses the cooperation property intrinsically. We utilize controlled off-path caching to achieve almost 9-fold increase in cache efficiency, and around 20% increase in server load reduction when compared to the classic on-path caching used in ICN proposals.",2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,2013,citation

The origin server might be overwhelmed by the large volume of validation requests from ubiquitous caches. In this paper, we propose a cache consistency architecture named Content Update Validation System (CUVS). It makes use of the servers located in each domain to provide the content validation service.

Nevertheless, the existing cache management scheme for the network of caches obtain poor performance. The main reason for performance degradation in a network of caches is the filter effect of the replacement policy. A cache serves the requests that generate cache-hits and forwards the requests that generate cache-misses. This filtering changes the pattern of requests and leads to decreased hit ratios in the subsequent caches. In this paper, we propose a coordinated caching scheme to solve the filter effect problem by introducing the selection policy. This policy manages a cache such that: i) the cache obtains a high hit ratio ii) the missed requests from the cache can be used by subsequent caches to obtain a high hit ratio. Our coordinated selection scheme achieves an overall hit ratio of a network of caches equivalent to that of edge routers with big caches. Moreover, our scheme decreases the average number of evictions per cache slot by four order of magnitude compared to the LRU universal caching.",ArXiv,2013,citation

DCN の概要 3.1. 基本構成 従来方式に対し,DCN では経路を集合ポイントに向 けてルーティングして経路情報を集約することで経路 情報数を低減する.また,集合ポイントを経由しない 最適化経路を形成することで,集合ポイントの負荷や 通信遅延を低減する.以下に DCN の基本構成および 動作を説明する. 図 1 では,DCN を構成する中継ノード(DCN ノー ド)が階層型のトポロジで相互に接続されている.第 1 階層にある DCN ノード(では Node1)をルートノー ドと呼ぶ.各 DCN ノードでは,近隣の DCN ノードの ID(ノード ID)とその上下関係および既定上位ノード が近隣ノードテーブル(NNT)に記録されている.例 として,図 1 には Node11 および Node121 の NNT が 示されている. データ ID は階層型(例:www.ex1.com/a/b)になっ ており,名前空間(例:www.ex1.com)とその配下の パス名( /a/b)で構成される.各 DCN ノードでは,デ ータ ID またはデータ ID のプレフィックスに対する次 ホップのノード ID が経路情報(RI)として経路情報 テーブル(RIT)に記録されている. 例えば,図 1 の Node11 の一つ目の経路情報は RI(www.ex1.com/a/c)= Node111 と記録されている. 経路の集合ポイントとなる DCN ノード(集約ノー ド)が第二階層以下に複数配置され,各集約ノードは 名前空間を一つまたは複数管理する.図 1 では集約ノ ードは Node11,12 で,それぞれ名前空間 www.ex1.com, www.ex2.com を管理している.ルートノードから集約 ノードまでの経路情報は図 1 の RIT(Node1)のよう に,RI(www.ex1.com)= Node11 とデータ名前空間の プレフィックスで集約されて各 DCN ノードに記録さ れるため,経路情報数は削減される.集約ノードのト ポロジ上の配置,名前空間の割り当て,上位ノードか ら集約ノードまでの経路情報の設定などは事前にネッ トワーク運用者が行うものとする. 3.2. 動作原理 DCN ノードの動作原理を説明する.DCN ノードは データの登録時にデータ登録要求(RReq)と経路削除 要求(DReq),データの取得時にデータ取得要求(GReq) とデータ取得返信(GRes)の 4 種類のメッセージを処 理する. 【データ登録要求(RReq)】 DCN ノードは,データ登録要求 RReq 受信すると, RIT に該当する RI がない場合は,転送元ノードを次ホ ップとして RI を追加し,RReq を既定上位ノードに転 送する.RIT に該当する RI がある場合は,経路削除要 求 DReq を次ホップに転送し,転送元ノードを次ホッ プとして該当する RI を更新する. 【経路削除要求(DReq)】 DCN ノードは,DReq を受信すると,RIT の RI に基 づいて DReq を次ホップに転送し,該当する RI を削除 する. 【データ取得要求(GReq)】 DCN ノードは,データ取得要求 GReq を受信すると, 該当するデータが保存されている場合は,データをデ ータ取得返信 GRes に乗せて返送する.該当するデー タが保存されていなく, RIT に該当する RI がある場 合は,GReq を次ホップに転送する.RIT に該当する RI がない場合は,GReq を既定上位ノードに転送する. DCN ノードは GReq を転送する際,GReq のメッセー ジ内に自分のノード ID を記録することにより,メッ セージ内に GReq が経由した経路の情報(MRI)が記 録される. 【データ取得返信(GRes)】 DCN ノードは,GRes を受信すると,メッセージ内 の MRI と自分が記録している NNT を参照した上で, MRI の経由ノードが NNT 近隣ノードに存在した場合 は,次ホップとしてその近隣ノードを RI に記録する ことで,よりホップ数の小さい経路(最適化経路)を 形成する.その後,MRI に基づいて次ホップに転送す る. 上記動作に加えて,データキャッシュを有効にした 場合,データの取得においてデータが返送される際に DCN ノードにデータの複製(データキャッシュ)が保 存される.また,取得要求がデータキャッシュを保持 している DCN ノードに転送された場合は,DCN ノー ドは取得要求のメッセージ内にあるデータ ID を参照 してデータキャッシュを返送する. 3.3. 動作例 DCN の動作例を以下に示す. 1データの登録(初回登録)(図 1 1) Host1 が Data1(www.ex1.com/a/c)を生成し,自分が 接続する Node1111 に送信する.Node1111 は Data1 を 保存し,RReq(Data1)を Node1111→Node111→Node11 と転送し,それぞれのノードは RI(Data1)を RIT に記録 する. 2データの移動(集約ノード配下)(図 1 2) Host1 が移動し,1と同じデータ ID を持つ新たに更新 された Data1(www.ex1.com/a/c)を生成し,Node1112 に送信する.Node1112 は Data1 を保存し,RReq(Data1) を Node111 に転送する.Node111 は DReq(Data1)を Node1111 に 送 信 す る の と 同 時 に , RIT を RI(Data1)=Node1112 に更新する.(これにより,Data1 の最新データは Node1112 に保存されたデータとなる.) DReq(Data1)を受信した Node1111 は Data1 の経路情報 とデータ自身を削除する. 3データの取得(ルートノード経由)(図 1 3) Host2 は GReq(Data1)を Node1211→Node121→Node12 →Node1→Node11→Node111→Node1112 と転送する.",,2013,citation

Most of the researches in this area focus on the optimal resources placement strategy under static query traffic and overlook the dynamic nature of the traffic. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Content Grid Adjustment Strategy (DCGAS) to balance the dynamic traffic load in a network. The main feature behind DCGAS is to adjust the number of resources in a network when the query traffic exceeds or falls behind some critical thresholds. The simulation results demonstrate that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art data replication schemes.",2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing,2013,citation

Because of the similarity between the naming scheme in ICN and URI, we evaluate the time and space complexity of a typical data structure for lookup of ICN names using URIs collected from the traffic trace of a campus backbone. We propose a simple and empirical Distributed Resolution Service (DRS) scheme according to the time and space complexity model. The proposed scheme can handle at least 1012 name entries using about 3, 300 nodes with commodity hardware.

For the time being, the research on NDN caching is still a preliminary topic, especially for the scenario of an ISP with multiple gateways. For more in-depth excavation, we have studied the effective intra-ISP caching under multiple gateways and multi-path routing in this paper. With the primary objective of reducing the inter-ISP traffic, we develop a popularity-based coordinated caching strategy named the Effective Multipath Caching scheme (EMC), which substantially saves more than 50% inter-ISP traffic and more than 30% content access latency. Through evaluation, we observe that EMC significantly outperforms the widely used Leaving Copies Everywhere (LCE) scheme and Leaving Copies with Probability (LCProb) scheme in terms of reducing both the inter-ISP traffic as well as the content access latency.

The MobilityFirst architecture, a clean slate approach towards supporting the requirements of mobile nodes in the Internet, provides a name-based packet delivery mechanism which splits the role of IP addresses into two primitives: a permanent unique identifier per host, and multiple network addresses or locators per interface. We show how this architecture is particularly suitable for enabling several different ‘modes’ of multihoming. In particular, our approach shifts the burden of policy expression and data-striping from end-nodes to in-network nodes, and utilizes the increased visibility at the routing layer to implement an efficient data-striping algorithm. Results from detailed NS-3 simulations shows improvements of up to 30% in file transfer times when compared to TCP/IP when connecting through the best interface, and aggregate throughput of more than 90% of the maximum achievable value, when connecting through Wi-Fi and LTE simultaneously.

While even analytical models for single caches proved to be challenging, nowadays, many configurations already encompass hierarchies of caches. Time-to-live (TTL) based caches have recently been proposed as a general approach to simplify performance analysis of caching networks. Previous work has used approximation and recursion techniques to characterize the inter-miss process which is essential to study this setting. This work introduces an appropriate mathematical abstraction of the cache model as a martingale representation.

A number of these shortcomings can be traced back to naming. The current Internet uses IP addresses to conflate identity and network location, which results in poor support for mobility and multihoming; vulnerability to hijacking and spoofing of addresses, etc. The Internet's name resolution infrastructure deeply embeds in its design the assumption of mostly stationary hosts and poorly satisfies the performance, security, and functionality demanded by modern mobile services. As a step towards addressing these shortcomings, we present the design of a global name service that forms a central component of the MobilityFirst, a clean-slate Internet architecture with mobility and trustworthiness as principal design goals. MobilityFirst relies on the global name service to cleanly separate identity from network location and to resolve identifiers to locations in a secure manner. More importantly, MobilityFirst capitalizes on the role of the name resolution infrastructure as a logically central, first point of contact to significantly enhance a number of network-layer functions such as supporting host and network mobility, multi-homed traffic engineering, content retrieval, multicast, and next-generation context-aware services. This paper identifies key challenges that must be addressed to realize such a vision and outlines the design of a distributed global name service that can resolve identifiers to dynamic attributes in a fast, consistent, and cost-effective manner at Internet scales.",2013 Fifth International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS),2013,citation

First, a theoretical model is proposed to evaluate caching efficiency of ICN and ICN-NC, and compare the caching efficiency between ICN and ICN-NC both analytically and by simulations. Then effect of different parameters on caching efficiency, such as file size, copy size and probability of replacement etc., are also extensively researched.

The Internet has transformed dramatically from its initial design and has grown far beyond its original vision. A future Internet design must facilitate this movement and, at the same time, accommodate dramatic evolution we might experience in the future. 
In this dissertation, we address the fundamental challenges in designing an Internet architecture that supports long-term evolution. We argue that interesting interactions between the network and the end-points can happen in the new environment and that they should be better managed and supported by the network architecture. To achieve this, we propose an integrated architecture that facilitates such interactions by supporting the evolution of the network's service model and systematically explore three different aspects of designing a network architecture that supports evolution. 
First, we present a network design that supports graceful introduction of new network-level functionality in an efficient manner. Unlike the current Internet, this design allows the introduction of new network-level abstractions along with new functionality. Second, we explore the implications of the network design on endpoints. We demonstrate that when networks provide new functionality, some of the features that were traditionally implemented purely at the end-points can now be better handled in cooperation with the network. Therefore, end-points' strategy may have to adapt to the functionality provided by the underlying network. Finally, designing a network architecture often requires designing a set of common behaviors that all routers, switches, and end-points must agree on. However, such common behaviors are especially hard to change once they are deployed, which significantly hinders the evolution in the network. However, we show that we can design a common behavior to support evolution. 
In summary, this dissertation demonstrates that a future network architecture can benefit from a design that supports evolution and accommodates diversity at various layers of the network without sacrificing the performance and efficiency.",,2012,citation

As far as the amount of digital identities is expanding at an accelerating rate, content-centric model provides administration capabilities of data transfer. We propose an innovative approach and implementation of privacy-aware Content-Centric Internetworking (CCN)-based of federated digital identity. Privacy requirements related to identity are translated with user-centric federated digital identity parlance into a set of eleven rules. CCN has been enforced by respecting a set of rules, designing a data packet and creating an identity contract. We provide an implementation of privacy-aware CCN data packet that is bound to XML-based digital identity document. We explain that the forwarding engine verifies the validity of digital identity document transmission on the basis of identity contract terms.

Breadcrumbs (an architecture with guidance information for locating a content cache) is designed to reduce server-loads and to form content oriented network autonomously in cooperation with cached contents. We also proposed Breadcrumbs+ which solves BC's problem that queries visit the same routers repeatedly with forming a loop of routing. However, Breadcrumbs itself still has a technical issue that some queries potentially traverse longer hops compared to conventional approach. In addition, Breadcrumbs takes only a passive approach; a query is routed by a trail of BCs only when the query happens to encounter a corresponding BC. This indicates that Breadcrumbs has a space to enhance its capability. We expect that active and adaptive control of BC improves user experience. In this paper, we propose Active Breadcrumbs which provides higher cache utilization through active spreading guidance information around cache-nodes. Finally, we show the effectiveness of Active Breadcrumbs in terms of traversing content/query hops and server utilization through the extensive computer simulation.",37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks,2012,citation

Our proposed mechanism brings benefit for both end users and service providers. For end users, it shortens the duration while user must stay online for uploading their generated content. Also for service providers, it reduces peak traffic volume between edge networks and data centers by slightly shifting the upload timing without incurring much extra latency overhead added. Our analysis with replaying the captured traffic shows that this mechanism reduces upload tether time of 24% end users by more than half and flattens the traffic peak for the access service provider by 37%.",2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications,2012,citation

As a result, performance of end-to-end protocols is often poor and many in-network optimizations are hard to deploy because they do not fit into today's Internet architecture. This thesis takes a clean slate approach towards better accommodating diversity in the Internet architecture. We propose two architectural concepts: i) today's end-to-end transport is unbundled such that network specific functions, like congestion control, are implemented on a per-segment basis, where a segment spans a part of the end-to-end path that can be considered homogeneous (e.g., wired Internet or an access network) and ii) we expose applications' data units and their naming to certain elements within the network, thereby facilitating the deployment of various data oriented and higher level services inside the network. We have designed a network architecture, Tapa, that systematically combines these concepts into a coherent architecture. Tapa uses end-to-end protocols that transfer application data units (ADU) over segments; these segments appear as traditional Internet-like ""links"" to the end-to-end protocols and can use Internet-style protocols (e.g., TCP/IP-like protocols in the backbone) or custom solutions at the edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Tapa by showing how it can support: i) various wireless and mobility optimizations, ii) an in-network energy saving service that can provide up to 2-5x improvement in battery life of mobile devices, iii) improved content distribution in online social networks, and iv) higher level services with new application semantics.",,2012,citation

In this paper, we propose a content caching scheme, WAVE, in which the number of chunks to be cached is adjusted based on the popularity of the content. In WAVE, an upstream node recommends the number of chunks to be cached at its downstream node, which is exponentially increased as the request count increases. Simulation results reveal that the average hop count of content delivery of WAVE is lower than other schemes, and the inter-ISP traffic volume of WAVE is the second lowest (CDN is the lowest). Also, WAVE achieves higher cache hit ratio and fewer frequent cache replacements than other on-demand caching strategies.",2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM Workshops,2012,citation

In addition, the number of available copies of a given content item and their distribution among caches is clearly impacted by the request forwarding policy.
 In this paper we gather initial design considerations for an ICN request forwarding strategy by spanning over two extremes: a deterministic exploitation of forwarding information towards a ""known"" copy and a random network exploration towards an ""unknown"" copy, via request flooding. By means of packet-level simulations, we investigate the performance trade-offs of exploitation/exploration approaches, and introduce an hybrid solution.

An important requirement of such applications is timely delivery. However, the intermittent connectivity of DTNs may significantly delay content exchange and cannot guarantee timely delivery. The state-of-the-arts capture the mobility patterns or social properties of mobile devices. However, there is little optimization in terms of the delivered content. Without such optimization, the content demanded by a large number of subscribers could follow the same forwarding path as the content by only one subscriber. To address the challenge, in this paper, we separate content routing from content forwarding. For content routing, we leverage content properties to derive an optimal routing hop count for each content in order to maximize the number of nodes which receive demanded content. Next, for timely forwarding, we develop node utilities to capture interests and mobility patterns of mobile devices for the selection of content carriers. The distributed greedy relay scheme, Ameba, leverages the optimal routing hop count and developed utilities to timely relay content to the needed nodes as fast as possible. Illustrative results show that Ameba is able to achieve comparable delivery ratio as the Epidemic but with much lower overhead.","2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)",2012,citation

ICN focuses on content handling and distribution rather than host-to-host communications. Satellite systems have always played a key role in content distribution and therefore, they are expected to be fundamental components of the information-centric networking. However, it is not obvious whether solutions that are being developed for terrestrial ICNs are effective in satellite scenarios as well. More specifically, focus of this paper is on in-network content caching, which is an important feature characterizing all ICN proposals but, as we will show, should be re-designed to address the specific characteristics of satellite networks. Indeed, in this paper a novel caching scheme named SatCache is proposed which exploits the broadcast nature of satellite communication media and creates a profile of the preferences of network users in order to estimate their potential interest in a given content.

These challenges stem from the increasing incorporation of distributed renewable energy sources on to the grid, the rising deployment of electric vehicles, and active consumer participation into power grid operations, all of which communicate with the utility control center with varying degrees of priority and security. To address these challenging requirements, we propose SeDAX, a SEcure Data-centric Application eXtensible platform for Smart Grid applications. SeDAX implements scalable, resilient and secure data delivery and data sharing in a wide area network. The platform can scalably handle high volumes of data generated by both applications and sensors. The SeDAX architecture has as its basis a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) network. The properties of the DT graph are leveraged to scalably support secure data-centric (or information-centric) group communication. The primary goals of this platform are to support communication resilience and data availability. The key functional blocks of the SeDAX platform are: (1) a geographic hash forwarding algorithm that operates over the DT graph (DT-GHF), and (2) a DT-based data replication scheme. The forwarding and replication schemes are scalable and cost effective in terms of communication overhead and memory. We describe the design details of the SeDAX platform and present empirical results on the performance of SeDAX as compared with other geometric-based alternatives such as Geographic Hash Table (GHT) forwarding and Content Addressable Networking (CAN). The operation of SeDAX is illustrated in the context of implementing demand response, a known Smart Grid application.",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2012,citation

Since the design of IP, the usage of the Internet has changed from a messaging and few-to-few information sharing system to a fewto-many content distribution system where many users request large amounts of overlapping information. Running a content distribution network over a host-to-host network appears to be very inefficient since every piece of content needs to travel the complete distribution-chain from generator to consumer every time it is requested. The result is that identical pieces of information will often redundantly travel the same links and routers. Information Centric Networking tries to solve this problem by proposing route-by-name instead of route-by-address mechanisms. This enables networks to be optimized for contentdistribution instead of connections and allows routers to cache often requested pieces of content in memory. In this thesis we will attempt to solve problems that arise at the introduction of a new globally routeable network, enabling clients and networks to be a full member (both consumer and generator) on a global Information Centric Network. The topics discussed vary from dynamic end-user configuration and generating globally unique names in order to share information on the Information Centric Network, via mapping techniques to decrease routing complexity, to proposing a transition mechanism that dynamically creates IP encapsulating tunnels between disconnected Information Centric Networks. In short, we discuss a multitude of problems which need to be addressed in order to assist the global implementation of an Information Centric Network.",,2012,citation

ever-growing routing and forwarding tables. Although hardware advances 
do accommodate such a growth, we anticipate new requirements e.g. in 
data-oriented networking where each content piece has to be referenced 
instead of hosts, such that current approaches relying on global 
information will not be viable anymore, no matter the hardware 
progress. In this thesis, we investigate greedy routing methods that 
can achieve similar routing performance as today but use much less 
resources and which rely on local information only. To this end, we 
add specially crafted name spaces to the network in which virtual 
coordinates represent the addressable entities. Our scheme enables participating 
routers to make forwarding decisions using only neighbourhood information, 
as the overarching pseudo-geometric name space structure already 
organizes and incorporates ""vicinity"" at a global level. 
 
A first challenge to the application of greedy routing on virtual 
coordinates to future networks is that of ""routing dead-ends"" 
that are local minima due to the difficulty of consistent coordinates 
attribution. In this context, we propose a routing recovery scheme 
based on a multi-resolution embedding of the network in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces. 
The recovery is performed by routing greedily on a blurrier view of the network. The 
different network detail-levels are obtained though the embedding of 
clustering-levels of the graph. When compared with 
higher-dimensional embeddings of a given network, our method shows a 
significant diminution of routing failures for similar header and 
control-state sizes. 
 
A second challenge to the application of virtual coordinates and 
greedy routing to future networks is the support of 
""customer-provider"" as well as ""peering"" relationships between 
participants, resulting in a differentiated services 
environment. Although an application of greedy routing within such a 
setting would combine two very common fields of today's networking 
literature, such a scenario has, surprisingly, not been studied so 
far. In this context we propose two approaches to address this scenario. 
 
In a first approach we implement a path-vector protocol similar to 
that of BGP on top of a greedy embedding of the network. This allows 
each node to build a spatial map associated with each of its 
neighbours indicating the accessible regions. Routing is then 
performed through the use of a decision-tree classifier taking the 
destination coordinates as input. When applied on a real-world dataset 
(the CAIDA 2004 AS graph) we demonstrate an up to 40% compression ratio of 
the routing control information at the network's core as well as a computationally efficient 
decision process comparable to methods such as binary trees and tries. 
 
 
In a second approach, we take inspiration from consensus-finding in social 
sciences and transform the three-dimensional distance data structure 
(where the third dimension encodes the service differentiation) into a 
two-dimensional matrix on which classical embedding tools can be used. 
This transformation is achieved by agreeing on a set of 
constraints on the inter-node distances guaranteeing an 
administratively-correct greedy routing. The computed distances are 
also enhanced to encode multipath support. We demonstrate a good 
greedy routing performance as well as an above 90% satisfaction of multipath constraints 
 when relying on the non-embedded obtained distances on synthetic datasets. 
 As various embeddings of the consensus distances do not fully exploit their multipath potential, the use of compression techniques such as transform coding to 
approximate the obtained distance allows for better routing performances.",,2012,citation

Due to its nature, this kind of a communication network lends itself readily to name-oriented abstractions. In this paper, we extend our previous work on floating content, extract its fundamental characteristics, and define a system model and a simple API with a set of basic programming elements to support applications in leveraging opportunistic content sharing as a generic communication facility. We validate our API through application examples and show how their communication needs are mapped to our model.

The core issue to be addressed is the more efficient distribution of information to a large set of receivers. Avoiding state in the forwarding elements is crucial for any scheme to be successful. This paper addresses this challenge by revisiting the idea of in-packet Bloom filters and source routing. As opposed to the traditional in-packet Bloom filter concept which represent the trees flatly as sets, we build our filter by enclosing limited information about the structure of the tree, namely its stage decomposition, which helps to get rid of typical Bloom filter illnesses as infinite loops and false positive forwarding. Our analytical and simulation results show that by using this information we obtain more succinct tree representation while still maintaining forwarding efficiency.",2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2012,citation

The question of how caching will behave over a general caching network such as CCN under cache pollution attacks has never been answered. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called CacheShield for enhancing cache robustness. CacheShield is simple, easy-to-deploy, and applicable to any popular cache replacement policy. CacheShield can effectively improve cache performance under normal circumstances, and more importantly, shield CCN routers from cache pollution attacks. Extensive simulations including trace-driven simulations demonstrate that CacheShield is effective for both CCN and today's cache servers.

This new Internet architecture proposal can bring many benefits and it has attracted many research works. When we study on these research, we found that one of the important components, the Pending Interest Table (PIT), did not get much attention. Since that in CCN the networking behaviours are no longer based on endpoints location but rather on every piece of the content itself, and the PIT is involved in both the forwarding processes upstream and downstream, in case of large amount of requests, the table size is a big issue, that leads to a large required memory space for implementing such a CCN node. In this paper, we propose a distributed PIT table, named DiPIT, where a part of the PIT is on every interface. Our approach relies on Bloom Filters in order to reduce the necessary memory space for implementing the PIT, completed with a central Bloom Filter for limiting the false positives, generated by the individual Bloom Filters. The evaluations we have performed highlight that our DiPIT approach can significantly reduce the memory space (up to 63%) in the CCN node and support a higher incoming packet throughput, compared to the hash table technology, which is largely implemented in current routers.",2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),2012,citation

In this thesis, we conduct a green analysis of content-centric networking and IP-based networking for a video streaming scenario. We consider two types of energy consumption: the energy required to manufacture the network devices and the energy required for operation. We perform simulations of content centric networking over three different network topologies (i.e., general tree, Content Distribution Network (CDN) tree and partial mesh) to assess the traffic rate reductions achieved by CCN’s insertion of caches at routers. We generated two different types of traffic demands (Zipf and Uniformly distributed) to perform our analysis. Although CCN network devices have a higher intrinsic energy consumption compared to the IP-based devices because of the presence of additional memory, by exploiting their caching capabilities it is possible to reduce the overall energy consumption of the network. Content caching at the routers present on lower levels of the network (near clients) results in reducing traffic on the links which are close to the server (content source). We exploit this feature of CCN-based network by using rate adaptation to achieve energy benefits. We consider both the incorporation of an on-line rate adaptation mechanism as well as a static network provisioning approach and observe that these approaches can lead to a substantial reduction in energy consumption for CCN. On the other hand, an IP-based network cannot benefit from rate adaptation due to the absence of the cache capable routers.",,2012,citation

Evolvability is highly desirable for the Internet, since communication patterns change must faster than the underlying infrastructure. Furthermore, the narrow waist plays in important role in enabling or preventing architectural evolvability. We argue that HTTP is highly evolvable, due to (i) naming flexibility, (ii) indirection support, and (iii) explicit middleboxes.

It names and accesses road regions using a multi-resolution system, which allows it to scale the amount of transmitted data with the available bandwidth. CarSpeak also changes the MAC protocol so that, instead of having nodes contend for the medium, contention is between road regions, and the medium share assigned to any region depends on the number of cars interested in that region.

Several future Internet architectures, putting the content (or information) in the fore-front, have lately been proposed in order to solve the limitations of the current architecture (i.e. insufficient bandwidth to servers, lack of security, mobility, virtualization, user/data centricity, etc.). However, one of the greatest challenges of a novel content-oriented Internet architecture lies in the complexity of looking up long, variable length names compared to the current 32 bit long IPv4 (or even 128 bit IPv6) addresses of today's networks. The success of widely adopting any content-oriented architecture highly depends on the success of designing algorithms that allow these complex names to be looked up at high-speed. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) are widely used in high-speed routers to find matching routes for packets in a routing table. They enable the longest prefix matching (LPM) operation on fixed length addresses to complete in a single clock cycle, however, they are not efficient to store and lookup name prefixes with variable lengths such as the ones proposed in name-based routing [2]–[9]. In this paper, we propose an efficient name-based longest prefix matching algorithm for information-centric networks using TCAMs. In our algorithm, we split incoming prefixes in fixed blocks and subsequently hash these blocks for fixed length storage. Our approach is flexible to support both hierarchical name based routing lookup and flat name based routing lookup. In addition, our approach can be easily modified to support multiple matchings1 instead of the longest prefix matching. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach is able to provide efficient name-based routing lookup even for the fastest backbone routers (i.e. 100+ Gbps).",2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2012,citation

In this paper, we propose a hybrid content centric architecture based on our pub/sub enhancement to CCN, Content-Oriented Publish/Subscribe System (COPSS). Our hybrid architecture (hybrid-COPSS) addresses both the need for incremental deployment of CCN and also elegantly combines the functionality of content centric networks and the efficiency of IP forwarding. Our architecture integrates IP multicast to achieve forwarding efficiency by taking advantage of shortest path routing. To overcome the lack of inter-domain IP multicast, hybrid-COPSS uses COPSS multicast with shortcuts as an overlay and IP multicast as the underlay to achieve inter-domain COPSS multicast.
 To demonstrate the benefits of our hybrid-COPSS architecture, we study its applicability for online gaming, which typically requires low latency. We use a gaming trace in our lab test-bed and microbenchmark the forwarding performance and queuing for a pure COPSS (representative of a pure CCN) based network versus hybrid-COPSS. Also, a large scale simulation (parameterized by the microbenchmark) on a representative ISP topology was used to evaluate the response latency and aggregate network load for the multi-player online gaming scenario. Our preliminary results show that hybrid-COPSS performs better in terms of response latency compare to pure COPSS in a single domain. In a multi-domain environment, hybrid-COPSS can significantly reduce inter-domain traffic while causing only a small increase in the average response latency.",ICN '12,2012,citation

We propose an incentive model for ISPs and analyze their maximum profits by studying the effects of cache allowance in their routers. The results confirmed from our analysis indicate that the minimum expected round-trip time can be achieved by deploying the maximum cache allowance in all routers. In contrast, the maximum cache allowance in the router connected to clients and the minimum cache allowance in the gateway router of an ISP that connects to the clients provides the maximum profit to that ISP.

Furthermore, we infer that frequency-based cache policies like LFU are supposed to perform well by analyzing the properties of optimal cache assignment, which is corroborated by our simulation results. We attempt to explore the impact of the distance between cache and the original content on cache policy performance by posing a novel cache policy named LB (Least Benefit), which takes into account the distance factor besides frequency. Through extensive simulations under various scenarios and configurations, we find that the performance gain brought by LB is limited in comparison to that of LFU, which implies that more sophisticated cache policies involving the distance factor should be considered to improve LFU.

It names and accesses road regions using a multi-resolution system, which allows it to scale the amount of transmitted data with the available bandwidth. CarSpeak also changes the MAC protocol so that, instead of having nodes contend for the medium, contention is between road regions, and the medium share assigned to any region depends on the number of cars interested in that region.

This paper investigates the potential of caching data at the router-level in content-centric networks. To achieve this, two measurement sets are combined to gain an understanding of the potential caching benefits of deploying content-centric protocols over the current Internet topology. The first set of measurements is a study of the BitTorrent network, which provides detailed traces of content request patterns. This is then combined with CAIDA's ITDK Internet traces to replay the content requests over a real-world topology. Using this data, simulations are performed to measure how effective content-centric networking would have been if it were available to these consumers/providers. We find that larger cache sizes (10,000 packets) can create significant reductions in packet path lengths. On average, 2.02 hops are saved through caching (a 20% reduction), whilst also allowing 11% of data requests to be maintained within the requester's AS. Importantly, we also show that these benefits extend significantly beyond that of edge caching by allowing transit ASes to also reduce traffic.",2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),2012,citation

Fulfilling these requirements, however, is complex as often the ability of a provider to satisfy requirements will vary between different consumers and over time. Therefore, we argue that it is vital to manage this variance to ensure an application fulfils its needs. To this end, we present the Juno middleware, which implements delivery-centric support using a reconfigurable software architecture to: (i) discover multiple sources of an item of content; (ii) model each source’s ability to provide the content; then (iii) adapt to interact with the source(s) that can best fulfil the application’s requirements.

This powerful feature benefits the content providers, the Internet service providers (ISPs) as well as end users since the requested content can be fetched from the nearest cache who is able to satisfy the request. Hence, server load, redundant network traffic and fetch latency are all reduced. However, given the huge number of contents in the Internet and the rapid replacement of cached contents, designing a scalable routing protocol to reach the full potential of universal caching is very challenging. Previous proposal in [1] tackles the problem by only considering contents on original servers in the control plane and opportunistically exploring cached contents in the data plane via so-called forwarding strategy. In this paper we argue that, to unleash the full potential of Information-Centric Networking, cached contents should be taken into consideration in the control plane and propose a specific scheme to achieve that.

NDN routers' forwarding process is able to detect network problems by observing the two-way traffic of Interest and Data packets, and explore multiple alternative paths without loops.

Recent reports suggest that the total amount of traffic might grow 4X by 2015. This is expected to put tremendous strain on installed network capacity. If left unaddressed, this issue could severely impact user experience in accessing content. Unfortunately, the obvious solution of upgrading link speeds is too expensive and cannot keep up with the rapid traffic growth. In this thesis, we explore alternate ways of improving network efficiency. In particular, we investigate removing redundant content transfers from the network to improve its efficiency. 
In recent years, protocol-independent redundancy elimination (RE) has emerged as a powerful technique to remove redundant content transfers. These techniques are used in many WAN optimization products to improve the effective bandwidth of stub network access links. We investigate the benefits of these techniques using several terabytes of packet payload traces and find that these mechanisms could give up to 60% bandwidth savings. Motivated by this study, we propose to extend the benefits of RE beyond access links and support RE as a primitive in the network stack. 
We propose deploying RE as a network-layer service on all routers. Such a service would expand the benefits of RE to all links, applications, flows and users. We develop SmartRE to realize the maximal benefits of such an architecture in practice. We also argue for deploying RE on end-hosts. An end-system RE service would eliminate redundancy from the traffic before it gets encrypted. It would benefit last hop links and provide additional energy savings for mobile devices. We develop EndRE for efficient redundancy elimination under various resource constraints on end-hosts. We also design an effective solution for RE on low bandwidth links. We develop BufferHash for efficiently indexing large content cache used in such settings. 
We believe that the RE primitive (network-layer RE or EndRE) has greater benefits than just bandwidth savings. Existing protocols can be redesigned better with RE as a primitive in mind. In particular, we explore redesigning routing protocols for better traffic engineering.",,2012,citation

This scenario appears in a wide range of situations, between a mobile device application and its server, in database situations. Another context is that of two routers which see similar traffic to populate their route tables and want to exchange these route tables. In all these cases, we need to periodically synchronize a local state and a remote state at the minimum possible cost in terms of bandwidth in between the two synchronization points. We consider a simple distributed source coding approach to the problem of efficient set reconciliation to support the exchange of this highly correlated caching information between a local and a remote system.

Scott Shenker et al. (SIGCOMM 2007) define the basic principles desirable for a dissemination network, but they do not suggest how to realize them. We introduce the Secure Pseudonymous Access (SPA), an access protocol suitable for every dissemination network. The main goal is to couple QoS constraints in terms of data reliability and secure access with easiness of service use, by removing most of administrative and user initialization burdens. The key issue is the user traceability, i.e. the possibility to tie together (in a provable way) the actions performed by the same user entity, along with pieces of data uploaded into the network to be shared with others. The signalling procedures of SPA are defined and the security issues are discussed; finally we describe a test bed implementation of SPA and give an estimate of procedure complexity.",,2011,citation

Our study stems from an observation that a transit AS (Autonomous System) has a financial interest in attracting extra traffic to the links with its customers. Based on real data about the actual hijacking incident in the Internet, we conduct simulations in the real AS-level Internet topology with synthetic demands for the hijacked traffic. Then, we measure traffic on all inter-AS links and compute the payments of all providers. The analysis of our results from technical, business, and legal viewpoints suggests that hijacking-based traffic attraction is a viable strategy that can create a fertile ground for tussles between providers. In particular, giant top-tier providers appear to have the strongest financial incentives to hijack popular prefixes and then deliver the intercepted traffic to the proper destinations.

For intuitive content sharing experience, an attractive approach named a content-centric networking (CCN) based virtual private community service has been proposed. The proposed CCN-based private community service had a hierarchical domain structure to efficiently manage multiple user and home domains. But it wasn't described how users can construct the hierarchical domain. In this paper, we propose the procedure of how users intuitively and securely construct CCN-based virtual private community. To support the construction of the proposed CCN-based virtual private community, this paper proposes two main points: one is a membership association to represent the relationship between the members of a domain as well as between hierarchical domains. The other is location-limited channel (LLC)-based enrollment schemes to identify devices adaptively available for both short and long distance as well as to issue a membership credential to newcomer-devices. From the proposal, users can easily and securely identify community member's devices without using a trust third party (TTP) and can configure the memberships of all community domain classes for a newcomer-device only by one registration operation. Hence, the users can securely and easily construct their private communities to share private contents among the members of the communities.",IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,2011,citation

A single message has only one destination and the network does not provide a mechanism for delivering a message to multiple hosts. Therefore, in order to transmit the same message to multiple destinations, a host sends the message to each destination separately. This, however, leads to inefficient use of the Internet resources because packets carrying the same message traverse multiple times the same several first hops from the source. In this thesis we propose CacheCast a system for single source multiple destination data transfer. CacheCast does not change the host-to-host communication model. It is based on a link layer caching technique that removes redundant transfers of the same data. CacheCast consists of two elements: distributed architecture of link caches and server support. The link caches are designed to work independently. A single link cache consists of two elements that operate on the link end-points. The cache management unit located at the link entry removes from packets data that is already present in the cache store unit located at the link exit. The cache store unit reconstructs the packets from the local cache and passes them to a router for further processing. The server support provides a mechanism for an application to transmit the same data over multiple connections in the CacheCast manner. The resulting packets carrying the data are annotated with information that simplifies redundancy detection and removal. This, in turn, greatly reduces the storage and complexity requirements of link caches. The CacheCast system is incrementally deployable. It preserves the end-to-end relationship between communicating hosts thus it can operate with firewalls or NATs. The CacheCast deployment requires minimal changes in the network operation and the minimum amount of resources. The thesis evaluates three aspects of the CacheCast system. Firstly, it assesses the efficiency in terms of network bandwidth consumption during single source multiple destination transfer. It shows through analysis and simulations that CacheCast achieves near perfect multicast efficiency. Secondly, the thesis studies impact of the link caches on the network traffic. Simulations performed in the ns-2 network simulator indicate that CacheCast does not violate current understanding of “fairness” in the Internet. Thirdly, the thesis evaluates the computational complexity of the server support and link cache elements. The server support is implemented as a system call in Linux. The detailed measurements of the system call execution show that it outperforms the standard send system call when transmitting data to multiple destinations. The link cache is evaluated in the context of the Click router. Even though, the link cache elements consume the router processing capacity, the CacheCast router can forward much larger traffic volumes than a standard router. Finally, the thesis includes an example of a live streaming application that uses the CacheCast system to transmit audio stream to thousands of clients.",,2011,citation

It is natural to ask what will be the impact of such evolution on the design of future Online Social Networks (OSNs). There is evidence that human social networks may be invariant with respect to the underlying online technology supporting them. Furthermore, the increasing pervasiveness of communication technologies is likely to enable any two users to communicate anytime and anywhere. Thus, a possible evolution of OSN design could map directly the structure of human social networks, and build future OSN services on top of a network whose edges represent “communication channels” between users sharing social relationships, and acti vated when they interact because of their social ties. In thi s paper we look, in the perspective of future OSN designed according to this concept, at how the patterns of interactio ns between people in human social networks impact on information dissemination properties. Based on well-established theories from the anthropology field, we study the propertie s of inter-contact times between users, i.e. the time between successive communication opportunities. This is a crucial feature for information dissemination, as previous result s obtained in a conceptually similar environment have shown that the distribution of inter-contact times determines th e convergence properties of information diffusion protocols. In the paper we investigate, by analysis, simulation and experimental results, the impact of different users interact ion patterns on the properties of inter-contact times and, thus , on the convergence properties of information dissemination protocols.",,2011,citation

As many researchers observed, multipath routing is a promising paradigm to address these issues. In this thesis, we argue that multipath routing can indeed go a long way towards these goals as well as lead to a more scalable, extensible, and evolvable Internet. 
We begin by describing Yet Another Multipath Routing (YAMR) protocol that provably constructs a set of paths resilient to any one interdomain link failure. YAMR uses an efficient scheme to construct the paths and a novel failure hiding technique to further reduce the control plane overhead. 
Next, we describe Pathlet Routing, a protocol that departs from the path-vector paradigm. Pathlet routing allows ASes to advertise policy-compliant path segments called pathlets, and allows users to stitch them together, thus forming a complete path suitable for the user's particular needs. Pathlet routing greatly reduces the forwarding table size, can efficiently express a wide class of routing policies, and provide an exponential number of paths to the users. Finally, we investigate how pathlet routing can be a basis for an evolvable Internet architecture.",,2011,citation

However, such simplicity comes as a major hurdle to flexibility and functionality to the architecture. This is evident from the increasingly numerous and complex engineering solutions and optimizations required to accommodate essential qualities like mobility, security, realtime communication support etc or to mitigate the shortcomings inherent in the ‘traditional Internet’ architecture. While a clean slate approach to address these shortcomings is not an option in a realistic scenario, it is important to examine the architecture as a whole to address emerging network requirements and overcome existing shortcomings at the architecture level rather than engineering solutions to an existing inefficient one. This architectural re-examination should also facilitate discussion into what design principles for future generations of Network Architectures which will eventually replace the design tenets for the current Internet. While 3G and 4G systems were more focussed on convergence towards an All-IP network and some improvements in the core network, the architectural design remains stagnant with layered paradigms and inherent inefficiencies. A departure from this shackled approach could be the distinguishing feature of 5G systems and beyond. We claim that there is a pressing need to move towards a Next Generation Network architecture built to natively support requirements such as network resource abstraction, mobility, security, enhanced routing, privacy, context communications, QoS, parallel processing, heterogeneous networking etc. Instead of treating the network as just providing connectivity specified by endpoints, it is of great advantage to applications to recognise it as a service characterized by attributes, abstracted to a higher level to represent a collection of capabilities that the network offers. This uniform high level abstraction can effectively mask the heterogeneity and implementation discrepancies in the underlying infrastructure. Besides, in a network environment where an connectivity instance might transverse diverse business/ownership/capability domains, the approach proposed in this article can provide a transparent abstraction for resource negotiations across the domain to be available for end-to-end setup. This architectural change should also be manifested according to the principles of SOA to ensure interoperability, backwards compatibility and migration. In this article, we introduce a Service Oriented framework and network architecture aimed at tackling the heterogeneity of emerging requirements and proposed solutions into a coherent interoperable architecture using Web Services specifications as the basic standards. We propose to model the new architecture on relationships between entities and discuss the motivation this new architecture in the form of a new framework called ROSA.",Wirel. Pers.

Among several proposals, Content Centric Networking has been conceived as a very promising solution by the Palo Alto Research Center team. It can be gradually deployed over current IP networks and solves different problems, as NAT Traversal, depletion of IP addresses, security, mobility, and multicast communications. In this work an analytical framework for investigating properties of Content Centric Network is proposed, with a particular focus on fairness in cache usage. It captures the distribution of content replicas among nodes of the network by taking into account contents availability, data popularity, topology information, and cache size.

We argue that the one request per packet mode of operation suggested in the early development of ICN applications is not a good fit for some types of traffic, such as media streams and real-time notifications. To efficiently deliver all kinds of information, we argue that an ICN should not only identify information by its name, it should also be aware of the nature of its traffic. We classify information traffic types based on two characteristics: a) reliable vs. unreliable transfer and b) real-time vs. on-demand delivery. The combination of these two characteristics leads to three broad categories: a) channels, b) on-demand documents and c) real-time documents. To handle all traffic types, we propose two extensions to the CCN architecture: Persistent Interests and Reliable Notifications.

Doing so, the security principles based on ownership and controlling access at the originating source become challenged. At the same time, moving intelligence into the network itself challenges the underlying assumption of having an Internet consisting of neutral, dumb, and fundamentally cooperating and trusting autonomous domains. 4WARD states the security principles necessary for dynamical management of virtualized, largely self-configuring entities having specific properties. The specific security implementation choices necessary for network design, transport, routing, lookup, privacy, accountability, caching and monitoring are part of the design process, for which 4WARD contributes functional descriptions and the concept of a design repository. 4WARD acknowledges and considers the business and governmental control interests that will heavily influence the security direction into which the future network evolves.",4WARD Project,2011,citation

There also have been studies on bundling strategies and performance issues in bundled swarms.

Any change of this part of the Internet needs argumentation as to why it should be undertaken in the first place. In this position paper, we identify four key challenges, namely information-centrism of applications, supporting and exposing tussles, increasing accountability, and addressing attention scarcity, that we believe an information-centric internetworking architecture could address better and would make changing such crucial part worthwhile.

In CONA, an access router is extended to figure out what contents are requested, and hence is called an agent. A CONA agent receives a content request from an attached host and delivers the requested content. In this way, CONA achieves the accountability and can take a countermeasure against resource-exhaustive attacks like DDoS. In the CONA implementation, we seek to support legacy hosts by redirecting HTTP requests (to the agent), capturing HTTP GET messages, and extracting content names. We implement CONA on a testbed consisting of NetFPGAOpenFlow platforms.

The demands of robustness, performance, and ubiquitous low latency for a worldwide population have led to an architecture where the names of services are largely symbolic, and do not name specific hosts or locations. Traffic is redirected onto a service network through the use of proxies. A typical example is a web proxy. Currently, proxies are generally accessed through layer 4-7 scripts and commands, such as the route command on Posix systems and, usually, manual configuration or Javascript code for a web proxy. This process is tedious and error-prone, and far from robust. New open protocols at the switching layer (layer 2) now enable far more robust and seamless packet redirection, without need for user configuration or unreliable scripts.

Currently, the Internet lacks efficient network level security solutions and is vulnerable to various attacks, especially to distributed denial-of-service attacks. Traditional end-to-end security solutions such as IPSec only protect the communication end-points and are not effective if the underlying network infrastructure is attacked and paralyzed. This thesis describes and evaluates Packet Level Authentication (PLA), which is a novel method to secure the network infrastructure and provide availability with public key digital signatures. PLA allows any node in the network to verify independently the authenticity and integrity of every received packet, without previously established relationships with the sender or intermediate nodes that have handled the packet. As a result, various attacks against the network and its users can be more easily detected and mitigated, before they can cause significant damage or disturbance. PLA is compatible with the existing Internet infrastructure, and can be used with complementary end-to-end security solutions, such as IPSec and HIP. While PLA was originally designed for securing current IP networks, it is also suitable for securing future data-oriented networking approaches. PLA has been designed to scale from lightweight wireless devices to Internet core network, which is a challenge since public key cryptography operations are very resource intensive. Nevertheless, this work shows that digital signature algorithms and their hardware implementations developed for PLA are scalable to fast core network routers. Furthermore, the additional energy consumption of cryptographic operations is significantly lower than the energy cost of wireless transmission, making PLA feasible for lightweight wireless devices. Digital signature algorithms used by PLA also offer small key and signature sizes and therefore PLA's bandwidth overhead is relatively low. Strong security mechanisms offered by PLA can also be utilized for various other tasks. This work investigates how PLA can be utilized for controlling incoming connections, secure user authentication and billing, and for providing a strong accountability without an extensive data retention by network service providers.",,2010,citation

While isolated caches have been studied in-depth, multi-cache systems are not well understood, especially in networks with arbitrary topologies. In order to gain insight into and manage these systems, a low-complexity algorithm for approximating their behavior is required. We propose a new algorithm, termed a-Net, that approximates the behavior of multi-cache networks by leveraging existing approximation algorithms for isolated LRU caches. We demonstrate the utility of a-Net using both per- cache and network-wide performance measures. We also perform factor analysis of the approximation error to identify system parameters that determine the precision of a-Net.",2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,2010,citation

To meet the needs of these online services, we introduce SCAFFOLD--an architecture that provides flow-based anycast with (possibly moving) service instances. SCAFFOLD allows addresses to change as end-points move, in order to retain the scalability advantages of hierarchical addressing. Successive refinement in resolving service names limits the scope of churn to ensure scalability while in-band signaling of new addresses supports seamless communication as end-points move. We design, build, and evaluate a SCAFFOLD prototype that includes an end-host network stack (built as extensions to Linux and the BSD socket API) and a network infrastructure (built on top of OpenFlow and NOX). We demonstrate several applications, including a cluster of web servers, partitioned memcached servers, and migrating virtual machines, running on SCAFFOLD.",,2010,citation

However, simple implementation of it into ISP network imposes several issues: long query length, overloading, and the ignorance of network status in routing which is one of strengths of ISP-provided service. In order to resolve the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces network domain heuristic based merging and dynamic cost-based cooperative routing that exploits service load and network cost together. According to simulation based evaluation, our proposed approach achieves around 40% shorter latency in both delivery and query.

We design, execute, and report on the results of an academic course-based engagement and dissemination pilot-trial for a revolutionary clean-slate internetworking architecture: the Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP). ICT capabilities have evolved considerably since the inception of the Internets predecessor, ARPANet, spawning a variety of new usage demands and operating conditions and incentives for which the original Internet architecture was never intended. Although the Internet is highly successful, its architecture has arguably become ossified and it is ridden with operational problems stemming from the obsolescence of its endpoint-centric send-receive underpinnings. In the face of increasing demands, size, and complexity, a revolutionary architectural alteration is warranted to adapt the Internet to current usage trends and holistically address its growing range of operational problems. One potential revolutionary solution that serves as the centerpoint of this thesis is the clean-slate architecture proposed by the EU FP7 PSIRP project. It is imperative, however, that future Internet research is supplemented by efficient dissemination and exploitation activities so that technological enhancements are dutifully enacted. Unfortunately, the dissemination and exploitation of innovations from PSIRP and other revolutionary architecture proposals has been notoriously problematic. Our academic course-based engagement approach performed very well in practice and achieved a commendable participant completion rate. Participants exhibited a good grasp of PSIRP material and provided positive qualitative and quantitative feedback regarding the quality of the course. We also gained positive feedback on the overall success of the course from a reputable group of external evaluating experts. Moreover, our observations provide useful information for future undertakings of this kind.

Each packet rule is certified, guaranteeing that all parties involved in forwarding a packet agree with the packet's rule. Packets containing uncertified rules are simply dropped in the network.

Such an approach makes efficient content distribution possible by making information retrieval host-independent and integrating into the network storage for caching information.

Basic security functionality must instead be attached directly to the data and its naming scheme. A naming scheme to name content and other objects that enables verification of data integrity as well as owner authentication and identification is here presented. The naming scheme is designed for flexibility and extensibility, e.g., to integrate other security properties like access control. At the same time, the naming scheme offers persistent IDs even though the content, content owner and/or owner's organizational structure, or location change. The requirements for the naming scheme and an analysis showing how the proposed scheme fulfills them are presented. Experience with prototyping the naming scheme is also discussed.

It is assumed that an endpoint can reach any other endpoint by simply sending a packet addressed to the destination. This assumption is no longer borne out in practice: Network Address Translators (NATs) prevent all hosts from being addressed, firewalls prevent all packets from being delivered, and middleboxes transparently intercept packets without endpoint knowledge. Second, the Internet strives to deliver all packets addressed to a destination regardless of whether the packet is ultimately desired by the destination or not. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are therefore commonplace, and the Internet remains vulnerable to flash worms. 
This thesis presents the End-Middle-End (EME) requirements for connection establishment that the modern Internet should satisfy, and explores the design space of a signaling-based architecture that meets these requirements with minimal changes to the existing Internet. In so doing, this thesis proposes solutions to three real-world problems. First, it focuses on the problem of TCP NAT Traversal, where endpoints behind their respective NATs today cannot establish a direct TCP connection with each other due to default NAT behavior. It presents a set of techniques, called STUNT, that solves this problem without any changes to NATs or to existing operating systems. In STUNT, the communicating endpoints use signaling to coordinate the creation of NAT state that then enables a direct TCP connection. The second problem this thesis focuses on is that of mitigating unwanted traffic on the Internet, such as DoS attacks and worms, originating from botnets. It presents a simple architecture, called ShutUp, that mitigates unwanted traffic in a completely End-to-End (E2E) manner without requiring any changes to the network. Trusted code near the source of unwanted traffic, for instance in the virtualization layer, network card, or nearby router, responds to signals from the destination by taking corrective action. Finally, this thesis focuses on the broader problem of establishing connections that adhere to all applicable network policy, including access control, multihomed route control, and middlebox usage—all open problems in today's Internet. This thesis presents the NUTSS architecture which takes into account policy set by all stakeholders, including both the endpoints and the middle networks. NUTSS uses name-based signaling to negotiate high-level policy before connection establishment, and couples it to address-based signaling for efficient enforcement during the connection lifetime. NUTSS does not change the protocol stack and can be deployed incrementally. 
Solving each of the aforementioned problems requires a departure from the original Internet architecture. Yet in this thesis clean-slate solutions are expressly avoided in favor of evolutionary changes. The central argument of this thesis is that solving a wide range of architectural shortcomings of today's Internet, and incremental deployment are not mutually exclusive.",,2009,citation

Structured P2P networks maintain a deterministic overlay structure that allows for queries to be resolved with a limited number of overlay hops. 
In this thesis, we develop and analyze concepts for highly scalable P2P systems. The design goal of these systems is maintenance of a correct structure, even in highly dynamic environments where participants frequently join and leave the network. We introduce novel concepts that result in a more stable overlay structure and significantly faster look-up times without increasing the required signaling overhead. Concluding, we introduce a general concept for realizing services and features in P2P-based Voice-over-IP applications.",,2009,citation

In particular, its coupling of host identification and location identification has hindered the provision of effective mobile services. At the same time, its lack of support for multicast distribution causes a multitude of redundant unicast transmissions, leading to an inefficient utilization of network resources. Both these limitations are especially apparent in the case of real-time continuous media distribution. The publish/subscribe paradigm has been proposed as a promising alternative to the current send/receive paradigm for a future Internet architecture. In future publish/subscribe networks, multicast will be the norm, and this change of the end-to-end communication semantics will lead to a networking environment more suitable for mobility. In the context of this paradigm, this paper considers a prototype architecture based on the Scribe overlay multicast scheme. Preliminary simulation results show that our publish/subscribe network implementation achieves better performance during mobility compared to Mobile IPv6 in all relevant metrics, such as hand-off delay (or resume time) and loss of real-time traffic during disconnections, at the cost of a slight increase of the end-to-end delay due to the routing stretch imposed by the overlay.",2009 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium,2009,citation

However, classification is currently implemented, deployed and configured in an ad-hoc manner. Reliance on ad-hoc mechanisms make classification hard to configure, inefficient and inflexible. 
In this thesis, we address the above limitations by elevating packet classification as a fundamental network primitive. We do so by introducing a new classification layer in the network protocol stack, and by defining two control plane protocols—policy-based classifier deployment and generic classification offload. In policy-based classifier deployment, packets are explicitly redirected through the classifiers specified by network policy. Generic classification offload provides a signaling mechanism that enables different entities to collaboratively implement classification. Through prototype implementations, testbed experiments and formal analysis, we demonstrate that our solution simplifies deployment and configuration, and improves flexibility, efficiency and performance of packet classification.",,2009,citation

Access to that content is achieved using a communication model designed in terms of connections between hosts. This conflation of what content you want to access with where (on what host) that content resides extends throughout current network protocols, and determines the context in which they offer network security. Trust in content – that it is the desired content, from the intended source, and unmodified in transit – is determined by where (from what host) and how (over what kind of connection) the content was retrieved. A user believes they are reading the news from the New York Times when they access it via a user-friendly name for the authoritative source of that news – www.nytimes.com; whether guessed, known, or obtained from a trusted directory (Google) in response to a few relevant search terms. Implicitly, they are also trusting that a) the DNS has given them a reliable indicator of where to find a host authorized to “speak for” the name they are interested in, b) they have actually made an HTTP connection to that host or its delegate (such as a content distribution network, or CDN) and c) that the content retrieved over that connection is unaltered by any unauthorized intermediary.1 A user accessing a higher-value resource, say their bank account, may do so with confidence only over a connection further authenticated by a cryptographic protocol such as TLS [10]. This gives them assurance that not only is the data coming from the intended source (as determined by the trust model for evaluating digital certificates built into their software client), and that it has not been tampered with in transit, but additionally that it may be protected from eavesdropping by encryption.

Unfortunately, this information is currently very cumbersome to access and accessing the information disrupts the users' workflow. Internet services that offer those information with a seamless real-world integration are missing. In this paper, we argue that such Internet services are currently difficult to develop on a large scale because conceptual support for such applications is missing. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm, the Augmented Internet, that integrates a conceptual connection between the Internet and the real world into the next generation Internet. Requirements for the next generation Internet are analyzed based on multiple use cases. From this analysis, we conclude that it is feasible and advantageous to implement real- world integration as integral part of an information-centric network approach. To enable this, future information-centric network research has to take some additional requirements into consideration, resulting in minor but critical changes to the information-centric network approach, as will be discussed in this paper.

The continuous patching of the TCP/IP suite with ad-hoc protocol extensions and overlay solutions is regarded as a complex and costly solution in the long term. As a consequence, the so-called “cleanslate” approach to future Internet research has gained a lot of interest. One key question is to what extent a new networking paradigm is really necessary, e.g., as packet switching was to circuit switching in the 70s. The reasoning is based on the large scale use of the Internet for dissemination of named pieces of data [3]. A myriad of devices generate and request content, without caring about the actual data source as long as integrity and authenticity are assured [5]. Such an networking approach has been baptized as “data-oriented” [5], “content-centric” [3] or “information-oriented” networking [1], and aims at shaping the future Internet to interconnect information at large rather than evolving the host-centric architecture.

These range from large datacenter installations to swarms of mobile devices embedded in and interacting with the physical world. They are pushing the limits of what problems we can solve, be it organizing all the world's information, making sense of the genome, or the world's climate. As our dependency on such systems increases, so does the importance of their availability, reliability, and efficiency, as well as the costs and impacts of failures. The problem, however, is that our ability to build and program these systems is progressing faster than our ability to understand how they work, and, especially, how they fail. 
In this dissertation we argue that distributed systems should have traceability, or the ability to follow the execution of defined tasks or activities across the different components involved, as a first-class concept, creating the basis upon which to build tools to gain visibility into their execution and understand their behavior, performance, and failures. 
To demonstrate that this is feasible and useful, we designed and implemented two instrumentation frameworks targeted at two widely different points in the distributed systems space. The first framework, X-Trace, tracks the execution and records the causal relationship among arbitrary programmer-defined events in large-scale, loosely-coupled distributed systems. X-Trace is general, lightweight, and is designed to span different layers, components, machines, and administrative domains. We instrumented several protocols and applications with X-Trace, including two wide-area deployed systems, the Coral CDN and the OASIS Anycast service. We used the instrumentation to find and solve several performance and correctness bugs. The second framework, Quanto, applies to wireless embedded sensor networks, and tracks execution of programmer-specified activities to understand energy and resource consumption. Quanto provides network-wide visibility of resource consumption for related events in extremely resource-constrained devices. We show how we instrumented TinyOS with Quanto and can use it to do a complete map of where and why energy is spent by a node and across the network.",,2009,citation

Our work towards this goal is set in a clean-slate architecture consisting of modular rendezvous, routing, and forwarding functions. In this paper we present the interdomain routing layer and its interplay with the other components of the system. The proposed system is built around two types of nodes: forwarding nodes and branching nodes. The forwarding nodes are optimized for throughput with no per-subscription state and no need to change passing packets, while branching nodes contain a large memory for caching and can make complex routing decisions. The amount of storage space and bandwidth can be independently scaled to suit the needs of each network. In the background, topology nodes perform load-balancing and configure routes in each domain using a two-dimensional addressing mechanism. The paths taken by packets adapt to the number of active subscribers to keep the amount of in-network state and latency low. A new data-oriented congestion control scheme is introduced, which takes into account the use of storage resources on-path and is fair to multicast flows.",ReArch '09,2009,citation

The BIONETS system allows for high node mobility and disconnected operation; this introduces new challenges for the authentication of entities, as it is not possible to rely on any centralized authority to mediate among nodes. Thus, authentication is achieved in a distributed fashion, sharing the cost and effort among the nodes. To this end, this deliverable proposes to identify U-nodes by names that include physical or logical identifiers along with the hash value of the public keys of the nodes. The use of logical names inherently provides anonymity, because nodes are authenticated by public keys instead of physical identifiers; if, however, physical identifiers associated with the public keys are required, then a new authentication method is proposed in the absence of certification authorities, based on previously issued certificates along with the reputation values associated with the nodes. Authentication between T-nodes and U-nodes also requires an original solution, because T-nodes cannot communicate to each other and have limited computational and storage capabilities and no initial setup schemes are allowed to involve U-nodes. Therefore, challenge-response protocols must be based on symmetric key cryptosystems, without pre-shared secret keys between T-nodes and U-nodes. The proposed solution makes use of dedicated T-nodes, with higher computational and storage capabilities, which can implement authentication protocols based on public key cryptosystems. Authentication of services is another important issue, because the services are expected to change and migrate frequently. The solution is robust and is based on using the public keys for signing service elements, where the keys are arranged in a hierarchical structure with the root public key contained in the name by which the service is identified. Another problem for which a new solution is proposed is the slow adaptation of common reputation protocols upon arrival of a new U-node. The node maintains a verifiable record of its reputation values to be used to speed up the bootstrap of the system upon formation of a new connectivity cloud, or upon the entrance of a previously unknown node in an existing cloud. The high dynamicity and mobility of nodes, code and services in the BIONETS framework requires that services are carefully considered before they are migrated to a U-node. A reputation mechanism that allows U-nodes to select which services can be executed …",,2009,citation

One-hop DHTs give lower lookup latencies and lower lookup failure rates. However, it is hard to maintain large, wide-area one-hop topologies. We contribute aecast, a new topology dissemination algorithm for one-hop DHTs. It avoids expensive repair mechanisms and critical points of failure in existing one-hop DHTs. When a node discovers by anti-entropy that it has missed a topology update, it initiates ""controlled flooding,rdquo sending the update to nodes in the multicast tree that also missed the update. We compare aecast with a widely cited epidemic multicasting algorithm, pbcast, by analysis and simulation. Aecast gives at least fivefold fewer out-of-date nodes on average within one round of a topology update. We support it with a fault-tolerant topology agreement protocol, so that only legitimate topology changes propagate throughout the overlay. Consequently, we argue that one-hop DHTs deserve greater attention for Internet applications in which reasonably reliable nodes carry high lookup loads.",IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,2009,citation

This results in challenged networking environments, facing unpredictable and frequently changing connectivity (capacity, error conditions, latency) and node constraints (energy, computing and storage resources), among others.

Authors believe that ICN will enable ISPs to provide native support to typical data dissemination services (e.g. file sharing, distributed storage, caching, instant messaging, VoIP, etc.) currently provided by overlay networks and P2P applications (e.g. eMule/eDonkey [3], BitTorrent [4], Kazaa [5], Skype [6], Akamai [7], etc.). This will be possible by integrating most of the basic features of the current P2P overlay networks into the ISP's network infrastructure. As a result, new advanced communication services will be offered at a new networking layer, sitting on top of a transport infrastructure, based either on IP or whatever new transport technology. The potential of this change in the Internet architecture could be dramatic, since ICN impacts both the communication model and the network infrastructure.

Nowadays, more and more, the network becomes the basis of our life. Every single task in a normal day could be related to some type of digital data, whether be watching the TV or making the dinner. The fact is that everything is becoming “digital” and connected to the network. In that sense, for redesigning the digital world for the future in the next years, will be so important to carry out a hard research activity in these fields. Media Layer is the new media networking paradigm, it tries to redesign the networks communication in order to support the creation, sharing, distribution... of any kind of content, media or data, as a service or as a resource, between people and people and between people and machines. The philosophy of Media Layer is to become the de facto transport standard for everything, working in the most efficient possible way for both, data and multimedia content, in order to transform the network into the Lab where the whole humankind could work together, think together, innovate together. Starting from the simple idea that a network able to guarantee the media restrictive requirements in a live transmission or in a videoconference (delay, jitter, integrity...), only with some modifications could also guarantee at least the reliability for all kind of traffic.

However, recent internet statistics show that content-oriented traffic (e.g. web pages, multimedia clips) becomes more and more dominant. Even though content-oriented networking has received increasing attention, there have been few comprehensive and quantitative studies on how to realize a content-oriented networking framework. In this paper, we focus on the operational issues of the new networking framework: (i) how to locate contents, (ii) how to deliver contents, and (iii) how to cache contents. There are two major infrastructure alternatives in substantiating these mechanisms: a tree and a distributed hash table (DHT). We carry out comprehensive simulation experiments to compare these alternatives in terms of content transfer latency, cache effectiveness, and failure resilience. I. I NTRODUCTION The Internet has evolved from a small-scale academic testbed into a crucial social infrastructure. For 40 years since its inception, the Internet has tried to accommodate new and unanticipated requirements. However, its rigid design based on TCP/IP, internet service providers’ exclusive control of networks and so on have ossified the Internet [6]. One of the Internet design principles that hinders the current Internet evolution is the host-oriented communications. That is, the early stage Internet applications, such as remote login, file transfer, and e-mail, focused strictly on host-to-host communications, where an end user explicitly directs his/her host to communicate with another host. Over the past several years, however, the vast majority of Internet usage has become data retrieval and service access [23], [3], [16] (i.e.,data-orientedusage), where an end user cares about contents 1 but is oblivious to or less aware of the host (or its location) [16]. For example, (i) many people often use search engines like Google from which they jump to the data or service page irrespective of the location in which the desired data/service resides, (ii) web intermediaries such as web caches and content delivery networks (CDNs) [18] transparently redirect web clients to a nearby copy of the requested data without contacting the original Web server, and (iii) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications enable users to search and 1In this paper, we use “data” and “contents” almost interchangeably. In the literature, “contents” often have more semantics than “data”. retrieve the data without making them know the location or identity of the host. The common viable contribution of search engines, web caching, CDNs, and P2P applications is that they all seek to support data-oriented applications. They improve the data availability, ease-of-use, performance, and scalability of applications by overcoming the limitations of the host-oriented principles of the legacy Internet by manipulating DNS naming and/or name resolution. In other words, they decouple content files from their locations (or hosts) using various techniques such as caching, replication with transparent request redirection, maintenance of a searching infrastructure, etc. [16]. Recently, lessons from these several application/servicedependent ad-hoc solutions, have motivated “clean-slate” efforts [1], [16], [10], termed data-oriented or content-centric networking, which strive to redesign the host-oriented Internet to accommodate more and more dominant data-oriented Internet usage at the architectural level. The essence of contentoriented networking lies in decoupling contents from the service host/location not at application levels, but at networking levels. That is, content-oriented networking shifts the focus from transmitting data between two hosts (or their locations) to delivering data via a content identifier 2. The content-oriented networking architecture is expected to (i) free application/service developers from re-inventing the necessary mechanisms, and (ii) provide scalable and efficient delivery of the requested contents. However, there have been few studies that how to substantiate the content-oriented networking infrastructure in terms of performance metrics. In order to address the operational issues that are missing in the recent architectural studies on content-oriented networking in the literature, this paper explores two alternatives for content-oriented network infrastructures: a hierarchical tree and a flat distributed hash table (DHT). Whether we choose a tree or a DHT for the infrastructure affects almost every aspect of network operations: name resolution, content delivery, caching, and so on. We will compare these two alternatives in terms of scalability, robustness, transfer latency thoroughly. 2As an example, the Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) [16] r places endpoint-based DNS by a new name resolution mechanism using flat, certifying names and name-based anycast primitives above the IP layer.",,2008,citation

This difficulty stems from the unfounded implicit assumption that data-oriented routing policies directly reflect the underlying packet-level inter-domain policies.

While recent proposals of IP spoofing prevention mechanisms are weak at filtering spoofing packets due to the complexity in maintaining source IP spaces and the low incentive of deployments. To address this problem, we propose an efficient mechanism to extend the range of inter-domain IP spoofing prevention called MASK. Source MASK nodes inform destination MASK nodes about the source IP spaces and labels of their neighbor Stub-ASes in order to implement the marking and verification of packets towards the Stub-ASes, and limit the number of MASK peers through the propagation of BGP updates so as to reduce the overheads of computing and storing of labels. By utilizing the method of extending the spoofing prevention to Stub-ASes, MASK can not only enlarge the domain of the spoofing prevention service, but also filter spoofing packets in advance. Through analysis and simulations, we demonstrate MASK’s accuracy and effectiveness.",Science in China Series F: Information Sciences,2008,citation

Yet the architectures of the prevalent commercial systems are tightly bound to centralized control, static deployments, and trusted infrastructure, inherently limiting their scope and scale to ensure cost recovery. 
To move beyond such shortcomings, this thesis contributes a number of techniques that realize cooperative content distribution. By federating large numbers of unreliable or untrusted hosts, we can satisfy the demand for content by leveraging all available resources. We propose novel algorithms and architectures for three central mechanisms of CDNs: content discovery (where are nearby copies of the client's desired resource?), server selection (which node should a client use?), and secure content transmission (how should a client download content efficiently and securely from its multiple potential sources?). 
These mechanisms have been implemented, deployed, and tested in production systems that have provided open content distribution services for more than three years. Every day, these systems answer tens of millions of client requests, serving terabytes of data to more than a million people. 
This thesis presents five systems related to content distribution. First, Coral provides a distributed key-value index that enables content lookups to occur efficiently and returns references to nearby cached objects whenever possible, while still preventing any load imbalances from forming. Second, CoralCDN demonstrates how to construct a self-organizing CDN for web content out of unreliable nodes, providing robust behavior in the face of failures. Third, OASIS provides a general-purpose, flexible anycast infrastructure, with which clients can locate nearby or unloaded instances of participating distributed systems. Fourth, as a more clean-slate design that can leverage untrusted participants, Shark offers a distributed file system that supports secure block-based file discovery and distribution. Finally, our authentication code protocol enables the integrity verification of large files on-the-fly when using erasure codes for efficient data dissemination. 
Taken together, this thesis provides a novel set of tools for building highly-scalable, efficient, and secure content distribution systems. By enabling the automated replication of data based on its popularity, we can make desired content available and accessible to everybody. And in effect, democratize content distribution.",,2007,citation

Topology-based addressing improves scalability, since adjacent addresses may be aggregated into blocks and advertised as a single unit. However, if hosts move, or the network topology changes, these addresses must change. This poses two problems. First, in ad-hoc networks and sensornets, the topology is so fluid that topology-based addressing doesn't work. There has been a decades-long search for scalable routing algorithms for these networks with no solution in sight. Second, the use of topology-based addressing in the Internet complicates mobility, access control, and multihoming. 
Identity-based addressing, where addresses refer only to the identity of the host but not its location, would solve these problems, but would pose severe challenges for scalability. This thesis presents the first scalable routing algorithm for identity-based addresses. Implementation results from a sensornet deployment and simulations demonstrate the protocol outperforms several traditional wireless routing algorithms.

Not all of the problem is due to the small IPv4 address space and resulting NAT boxes. Even where global addresses exist, firewalls cannot glean enough information about a flow from packet headers, and so often err, typically by being over-conservative: disallowing flows that might otherwise be allowed. This paper presents a novel architecture, protocol design, and implementation, for flow establishment in the Internet. The architecture, called NUTSS, takes into account the combined policies of endpoints and network providers. While NUTSS borrows liberally from other proposals (URI-like naming, signaling to manage ephemeral IPv4 or IPv6 data flows), NUTSS is unique in that it couples overlay signaling with data-path signaling. NUTSS requires no changes to existing protocol stacks, and combined with recent NAT traversal techniques, works with IPv4 and existing NAT/firewalls.

Specifically CarSpeak names a region by referring to the root of the region's sub-tree; it expresses the resolution of the region using the depth from the root of the region's sub-tree. The Octree also enables a car to store its data efficiently because, though the world is huge, each car needs to only expand the part of the Octree in its neighborhood. • How does the system allocate the wireless bandwidth to the most recent data from the region, given that multiple cars may sense the same region and each car does not know what information other cars know? CarSpeak adopts a content-centric MAC where information objects , as opposed to senders, contend for medium access. Further, each information object (i.e., 3D-point cloud stream) obtains a share of the medium proportional to the number of requests it receives. CarSpeak implements this abstraction using a distributed protocol , where nodes that sense a region contend on its behalf. Requests for region data are broadcast on the medium. Nodes compute a summary value of the quality of the information they have of each region (which is a measure of the timeliness and completeness of this information). CarSpeak uses a low overhead protocol to share this information among the nodes as annotations on their transmitted data packets. Each car uses these annotations to compute how much sensory data it should transmit so that its contribution to each stream is proportional to the completeness and freshness of the data it has from the corresponding region. CarSpeak then enforces this allocation by controlling the 802.11 contention window appropriately. • How does the system compress the redundancy in the transmitted sensor data while being resilient to packet loss? CarSpeak makes each packet self-contained by assigning it an independent set of branches in the Octree that are derived from the root. As a result, each received packet can be correctly inserted into the tree independent of other packets. CarSpeak also reduces the overlap between data transmitted by cars that sense the same region. Recall that each region is a cube that encompasses many smaller cubes, whose values keep changing in realtime due to the arrival of new sensor data. In CarSpeak even if multiple cars receive a request for the same region (i.e., the same encompassing cube), each of them will pick a different permutation according …",,,citation

While explicating the mechanism of national identity construction, Lacan’s theory, as I argue, does not help distinguish among various visions of the nation. Therefore, I build upon Burke’s classification of symbolic frames (comedy, tragedy, epic, elegy, satire, the burlesque, and the grotesque) to differentiate among alternative fantasy-frames (Lacanian fantasy and Burkean frame) as more or less politically dangerous and ethically sophisticated.

While edge computing has advantages in the latency due to the short distance to end users, a variety of business applications have exploded, which has placed higher demands on the basic functions and service performance of the edge servers. This book will analyze these two trends in detail. This chapter introduces the research background, content summary, key contributions, and arrangements of the remaining chapters. 1.1 Research Background The rapid growth of service chains is changing the landscape of cloud-based applications. Different stand-alone components are now handled by cloud servers, providing cost-efficient and reliable services to Internet users. It is known that the workloads from service chains are more complex than the traditional noninteractive (or batch) workloads: for non-interactive workloads, such as scientific computing and image processing, they can be processed on one specific server and do not need interactions from other servers. Being not strictly time-sensitive, they can be scheduled to run anytime as long as the work could finish before a soft deadline. But for the interactive workloads from service chains, they should go through multiple stand-alone components to apply corresponding functions, and this unavoidably introduces additional latency. Meanwhile these interactive chained services typically process real-time user requests, such as business transactional and complex gaming control. Therefore, the performance for service chains is in urgent need to be ensured. Nowadays, data centers have become the cornerstones of modern computing infrastructure and one dominating paradigm in the externalization of IT resources. The data center tasks always consist of rich and complex flows which traverse different parts of the network at potentially different times. To minimize the network contention among different tasks, task serialization was widely suggested. This © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020 Y. Zhang, K.

However, current mobility management solutions generally require a central entity in the network core, tracking IP address movement, and anchoring traffic from source to destination through point-to-point tunnels. Intuitively, this approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in the network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point. This is often termed “dog-leg” routing. Meanwhile, alternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current limitations of the IP semantics, which strongly tie addressing information to location. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel anchorless mobility solution that overcomes these limitations by exploiting a new path-based forwarding fabric together with emerging mechanisms from information-centric networking. These mechanisms decouple the end-system IP address from the path based data forwarding to eliminate the need for anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing flexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating the limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the network cost compared to anchored solutions through bandwidth saving while maintaining comparable handover delay. The proposed solution is applicable to both cellular and large-scale wireless LAN networks that aim to support seamless handover in a single operator domain scenario. The solution is modeled as a Markov-chain which applies a topological basis to describe mobility. The validity of the proposed Markovian model was verified through simulation of both random walk mobility on random geometric networks and trace information from a large-scale, city wide data set. Evaluation results illustrate a significant reduction in the total network traffic cost by 45 percent or more when using the proposed solution, compared to Proxy Mobile IPv6.",IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,2016,citation

This need is complemented by the adoption of cloud principles for providing services, particularly for virtualizing service components with which virtualized instances can appear rapidly at different execution points in the network. While providing service endpoints close to the end user appears straightforward, this early service break-out is currently limited to routing requests to Point-of-Presence (POP) nodes provided by a few global CDN players deep in the customer network. In this paper, we propose instead to turn the edge of the Internet into a rich service-based routing infrastructure with services being provided through edge compute nodes, without needing indirect routing. Our approach interprets every IP-based service as a named service over a (L2 or similar) transport network, requiring no per-flow state in the network, while natively supporting both unicast and multicast delivery. The solution allows route adjustments in time scales of few tens of milliseconds, enabling rapid failure recovery, extremely responsive load balancing, efficient mobility support, and more.

As in the current Internet, selfish routing is also crucial problem in ICN. To the best of our knowledge, however, the selfish routing problem in ICN is remaining an unresolved challenge. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a Nash Bargaining based content registration (NBREG) method, which is used for register content names (dissemination of content reachability information) from the game theoretic perspective. NBREG allows neighboring domains to cooperate with each other without revealing their internal private information. Based on results from real (inter-domain topology) trace simulations and prototype implementations, we show that neighboring domains can obtain more benefits with NBREG than they register and forward contents selfishly.",2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),2018,citation

Nowadays, the internet serves a lot of purpose. It is a tool for not just information but entertainment that offers music, graphics and videos that is available for downloading or streaming. It has also evolved to be a medium of communication that offers a global link from people around the globe. From emails, short message services and even voice communication, the internet has all of these to offer. The former information superhighway is today a social media platform that is open to all ages to all variety of users. With this development, it is logical to think that the current internet network scheme should also be subjected to evolution. The emerging Information Centric Network is quite a good fit to the future of internet. The idea to be concerned to the content that is to be accessed more than the identity of the one accessing the content is tailor-fit to the current application of internet. In a nutshell, ICN requires node with caching functionality. An effective caching algorithm is a great help to attain the very purpose of ICN which is to come up with an efficient network. Meanwhile, fuzzy logic, which has proven to be effective in control or optimization applications, can also be applied in improving caching functionality of ICN. This paper explores the application of fuzzy logic to the caching algorithm that can be used to further improve current information centric networks.

However, the IP protocol, unlike ICN protocol implementations, does not provide an any-cast architecture from which a CDN would greatly benefit. In this thesis we introduce a novel cache eviction strategy called ``Bubble,'' as well as two variants of Bubble, that can be applied to any-cast protocols to aid in optimising video delivery. Bubble, Bubble-LRU and Bubble-Insert were found to greatly reduce the quantity of video associated traffic observed in cache enabled networks. Additionally, analysis on two British Telecom (BT) provided video popularity distributions leveraging Kullback-Leibler and Pearson Chi-Squared testing methods was performed. This was done to assess which model, Zipf or Zipf-Mandelbrot, is best suited to replicate video popularity distributions and the results of these tests conclude that Zipf-Mandelbrot is the most appropriate model to replicate video popularity distributions. The work concludes that the novel cache eviction algorithms introduced in this thesis provide an efficient caching mechanism for future content delivery networks and that the modelled Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution is a better method for simulating the performance of caching algorithms.",,2018,citation

Current wireless networks with different access and core technologies are tending towards network controlled mobility management (NetLMM) and eliminating any UE protocol stack modification to support mobility. This is mainly facilitated through a common mobility support architecture of a central mobility management entity and tunnelling approaches between this entity and the edge access routers to maintain user data session and IP address during mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel NetLMM approach using IP over Information Centric Networks (ICN) that exploits the ICN advantages in terms of decoupling requests resolution from data transfer in both time and space, representing active user sessions as information publications/subscriptions, thus eliminating the need of tunnelling user traffic through a centralized anchor (as in current IP mobility solutions). This approach leads to a reduction in network overhead, while preserving network controlled mobility to achieve efficient handover with minimum cost. We analyse the core network mobility costs in IP over ICN networks using random walks on connected graphs and derive the corresponding cost functions in terms of signalling and packet delivery costs. We compare the mobility costs with those of the IETF standardized NetLMM protocol, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). We also simulate both IP over ICN and PMIPv6 networks to investigate UE mobility using the two aforementioned core networks. Both analysis and simulation results show the significant gain in the total cost of using an ICN core to facilitate NetLMM mobility for IP end users.",ArXiv,2016,citation

The high bitrate traffic generated by ultra-high definition content reduces the effectiveness of current live video distribution systems. Transcoders and application layer multicasting (ALM) can reduce traffic in a video delivery system, but they are limited due to the static nature of their implementations. To overcome the restrictions of current static video delivery systems, an OpenFlow based migration system is proposed. This system enables an almost seamless migration of a transcoder or ALM node, while delivering real-time ultra-high definition content. Further to this, a novel heuristic algorithm is presented to optimise control of the migration events and destination. The combination of the migration system and heuristic algorithm provides an improved video delivery system, capable of migrating resources during operation with minimal disruption to clients.

The proposed system uses OpenFlow within a content delivery network (CDN) architecture, in order to improve several aspects of current CDNs. Aside from the reduction in stream delay, other improvements include switch level multicasting to reduce duplicate traffic and smart load balancing for server resources.

However, as protections like ASLR, stack canaries, and no-execute bits have made such attacks more difficult, data-oriented exploits have received increasing attention. Such exploits try to subvert a program by reading or writing non-control data, without introducing any foreign code or violating the program’s legitimate control flow graph. Recently, a data-oriented exploitation technique called memory cartography was introduced, in which an attacker navigates between allocated memory regions using a precompiled map to disclose sensitive program data. The efficacy of memory cartography is dependent on inter-region pointers being located at constant offsets within memory regions; thus, cartographic attacks are difficult to launch against memory regions like heaps and stacks that have nondeterministic layouts. In this paper, we lower the barrier to successful attacks against nondeterministic memory, demonstrating that pointers between regions of memory often possess unique “signatures” that allow attackers to identify them with high accuracy. These signatures are accurate even when the pointers reside in non-deterministic memory areas. In many real-world programs, this allows an attacker that is capable of reading bytes from a single heap to access all of process memory. Our findings underscore the importance of memory isolation via separate address spaces.",2021 IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops (SPW),2021,citation

These primitives form the foundation for code-reuse and data-oriented attacks. While various defenses against the former class of attacks have proven effective, mitigation of the latter remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify various shortcomings of the x86 architecture regarding memory isolation, and leverage virtualization to build an effective defense against data-oriented attacks. Our approach, called xMP, provides (in-guest) selective memory protection primitives that allow VMs to isolate sensitive data in user or kernel space in disjoint xMP domains. We interface the Xen altp2m subsystem with the Linux memory management system, lending VMs the flexibility to define custom policies. Contrary to conventional approaches, xMP takes advantage of virtualization extensions, but after initialization, it does not require any hypervisor intervention. To ensure the integrity of in-kernel management information and pointers to sensitive data within isolated domains, xMP protects pointers with HMACs bound to an immutable context, so that integrity validation succeeds only in the right context. We have applied xMP to protect the page tables and process credentials of the Linux kernel, as well as sensitive data in various user-space applications. Overall, our evaluation shows that xMP introduces minimal overhead for real-world workloads and applications, and offers effective protection against data-oriented attacks.",2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP),2020,citation

Consequently, they are more difficult to be detected hence prevented with traditional mitigation techniques that target control-oriented attacks. In this work, we propose a methodology for the detection of non-control-flow hijacking attacks via employing low-level hardware information formatted as time series. Using architectural and micro-architectural hardware event counts, we model the regular execution behavior of the application(s) of interest, in an effort to detect abnormal execution behavior taking place at the vicinity of the vulnerability. We employed three distinct anomaly detection models: a traditional support vector machine (SVM), an echo state network (ESN), and a heavily modified k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model. We evaluated the proposed methodology using seven real-world non-control-flow hijacking exploits that target two vulnerabilities in modern web servers and three vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL library. Because our proposed detection methodology employs the contextual information across the temporal domain, we are able to achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.36%, with a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.79% and false negative rate (FNR) of 0.53%, respectively.",HASP@ISCA,2019,citation

We also compare known defenses against these attacks, in terms of approach, detection capabilities, overhead, and compatibility. Then we discuss the possible frequency anomalies of data-oriented attacks, especially the frequency anomalies of DOP attacks with experimental proofs. It is generally believed that control flows may not be useful for data-oriented security.

Beyond the tenants' own security controls implemented in the virtual machine (VM), the binary integrity verification mechanism in the virtual machine manager (VMM) provides stronger protections against malware. Unfortunately, none of existing integrity verification mechanisms in the cloud provides complete transparency and fine-grained efficiency. Some schemes selectively check the integrity of sensitive binaries, but they require modifications to the VMs (e.g., integrating monitoring libraries) to trigger verification. Others, although need no modification to the VMs, have to enforce checking on all the binaries, because they cannot distinguish binary images for the sensitive processes from the binaries for insensitive ones, leading to significant performance overheads. In this paper, we present TF-BIV, a transparent and fine-grained binary integrity verification scheme, which does not require any modification or software/driver installation in the VM. TF-BIV identifies the sensitive processes at the creation, and checks the integrity of the binaries (including the guest OS kernel and the dependant binaries) related to these processes. The provided transparency and efficiency are achieved by leveraging existing hardware virtualization supports (i.e., Intel extended page table) and debugging features (i.e., monitor trap flag). We have implemented the TF-BIV prototype based on QEMU-KVM. To demonstrate the usability of TF-BIV, we adopted it for cloud-based cryptographic services, to achieve the strict invoking controls. In addition to the password-based authentication, TF-BIV further achieves process-level authorization to the invokers. Intensive evaluation shows that TF-BIV implements the designed binary integrity verification with only about 3.6% performance overhead.",ACSAC,2019,citation

Hence, buildings implement building management systems (BMSs), which monitor, control, manage and analyze each of these components. However, current BMSs are incapable of managing a massive amount of data (big data) and therefore cannot extract knowledge or make intelligent decisions in quasi real time. In addition, there are serious limitations to integrating BMSs with other services since they generally use proprietary software. In this sense, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that allows one to build distributed systems and provide functionalities such as services to end users or other types of services. Therefore, an SOA has the great advantage of allowing the expansion of the functionalities of BMSs. In fact, there are several studies that address SOAs for building management. However, we have not found any description or systematic analysis in the literature that allows the development of a versatile and interoperable SOA focused on the energy efficiency of buildings and that can integrate massive data analysis features. For these reasons, this study seeks to fill this knowledge gap and, more specifically, to identify and analyze the various software requirements proposed in the literature and the characteristics of big data that allow for improving the energy efficiency of buildings. To this end, we performed an in-depth review of the literature according to the methodology proposed by Kitchenham. As a result of this review, we provide researchers with a specific vision of the requirements and characteristics to consider for software development aimed at the energy efficiency of unique or historic buildings.",IEEE Access,2021,citation

Due to the limited amount of battery energy, energy harvestingmotivated networks (EHNets) powered by immediate environmental resources are increasingly popular and rapidly emerging as the next generation of ubiquitous communication infrastructure. However, EHNets are admittedly vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack because of the shared medium, centralized coordination, and limited computing and communicating capabilities. Because of inherent resource constraints, EHNets seldom deploying conventional heavy-weight cryptographic techniques and secure algorithms and protocols. In light of these, we first investigate energy harvesting-based networking operations and applications. Second, we analyze the different types of forwarding misbehavior and attack caused by malicious nodes and their corresponding detection strategies. We introduce a set of adversarial scenarios and visualize its communication activities to capture vulnerable scenarios and potential malicious nodes. Here, single and multiple malicious nodes colluding together are considered. Lastly, we comprehensively compare the detection strategies of forwarding misbehavior by considering six perspectives and provide future research directions with interdisciplinary points of view.

Despite the intense interest from researchers and practitioners, most do not have access to large-scale IoT testbeds for validation. Simulation environments that allow analytical modeling are a poor substitute for evaluating software platforms or application workloads in realistic computing environments. Here, we propose a virtual environment for validating Internet of Things at large scales (VIoLET), an emulator for defining and launching large-scale IoT deployments within cloud VMs. It allows users to declaratively specify container-based compute resources that match the performance of native IoT compute devices using Docker. These can be inter-connected by complex topologies on which bandwidth and latency rules are enforced. Users can configure synthetic sensors for data generation as well. We also incorporate models for CPU resource dynamism, and for failure and recovery of the underlying devices. We offer a detailed comparison of VIoLET’s compute and network performance between the virtual and physical deployments, evaluate its scaling with deployments with up to 1,000 devices and 4, 000 device-cores, and validate its ability to model resource dynamism. Our extensive experiments show that the performance of the virtual IoT environment accurately matches the expected behavior, with deviations levels within what is seen in actual physical devices.

In this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep learning approach is proposed for eventdriven source traffic prediction. The source traffic prediction problem can be formulated as a sequence generation task where the main focus is predicting the transmission states of machinetype devices (MTDs) based on their past transmission data. This is done by restructuring the transmission data in a way that the LSTM network can identify the causal relationship between the devices. Knowledge of such a causal relationship can enable event-driven traffic prediction. The performance of the proposed approach is studied using data regarding events from MTDs with different ranges of entropy. Our model outperforms existing baseline solutions in saving resources and accuracy with a margin of around 9%. Reduction in random access (RA) requests by our model is also analyzed to demonstrate the low amount of signaling required as a result of our proposed LSTM based source traffic prediction approach.",GLOBECOM 2020 - 2020 IEEE Global Communications Conference,2020,citation

Therefore, this study explores the role of application programming interfaces (APIs) for managing real-time, online, and historical energy data in the context of residential buildings and electric vehicles. Moreover, a layered architecture that employs APIs in big data is developed for district energy management towards providing energy information intelligence and support decision-making on energy sustainability in facilitating prosumption operations.

Moreover, these architectures need to be capable of offering low-latency delivery, which must not only feed real-time analytics applications, but also produce real-time actionable data that could enable operational business logic and automation triggers activation and transform microservices into cyber-physical microapplications. The design principles to build distributed event-driven applications are known to be complex and hard to handle at the application code level. As a result, there are several already well-known patterns that aim to provide a convenient solution and abstract the business logic development from the underlying architecture complexities. This paper proposes a common framework that addresses all the needs of an in-production application, that are hard to solve under the event-driven paradigm. It gathers existing patterns and combines them and extends them. These patterns are implemented and comprised in a middleware library which has been tested on a proof-of-concept architecture implementation, based on Apache Kafka.",2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion (UCC Companion),2018,citation

However, they constrain themselves to “local” data, data that exists within or “close” to the organization, or external data imported to local systems. And yet, as it has been recently pointed out, “the value of data explodes when it can be linked with other data.” In this paper we present our vision for a global marketplace of analytics—either in the form of per-entity metrics or per-entity data, provided by globally accessible data management tasks— where a data scientist can pick and combine data at will in her data mining algorithms, possibly combining with her own data. The main idea is to use the dataframe, a popular data structure in R and Python. Currently, the columns of a dataframe contain computations or data found within the data infrastructure of the organization. We propose to extend the concept of a column. A column is now a collection of key-value pairs, produced anywhere by a remotely accessed program (e.g., an SQL query, a MapReduce job, even a continuous query.) The key is used for the outer join with the existing dataframe, the value is the content of the column. This whole process should be orchestrated by a set of well-defined, standardized APIs. We argue that the proposed architecture presents numerous challenges and could be beneficial for big data interoperability. In addition, it can be used to build mediation systems involving local or global columns. Columns correspond to attributes of entities, where the primary key of the entity is the key of the involved columns.",DOLAP,2018,citation

Motivation is the fact that on the one hand we face a shift to the usage of more and more mobile devices but on the other hand most services in the Internet still use a classic client-server-approach. Data is mainly produced at private devices today and put on centralized servers afterwards. This situation reflects the actual reality better: data is shared directly among users without the need of centralized sources. Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share.

Each system targets well a specific application area, reinforcing the belief that the era of one-size fits all has gone. Interoperability, systems' connectivity and high-level data models become once again the core of research initiatives. In this paper we present our vision for a layered architecture to support interoperability among different data management systems, generalized under the term data management entities (DMEs). DMEs range from JVMs running java programs to Hadoop systems employing complex MapReduce jobs to traditional RDBMS running SQL queries to stream engines and CEP scripts. The top layer consists of a universe of DMEs, communicating through a well defined http-like protocol: a DME transparently invokes another DME's data manipulation task, regardless task's nature. Communicating DMEs share/operate on a shared data object, a key-value set (KVS) - just a set of key-value pairs - which exists in the layer below and is referenced through a unique (internet-wide) address via a well-defined API. This layer serves as the transient common memory space for communicating DMEs and consists of globally addressable KVSs, organized in domains, sub-domains, etc. In a way, this approach constitutes a form of remote procedure call by reference (the KVS is the common reference). We argue that this architecture allows the construction of high level query languages and cost-based distributed query processing engines, involving completely heterogeneous data manipulation tasks. For example, we show that MapReduce evaluation algorithm and distributed relational query processing are just instances of the proposed architecture. We also claim that it can easily facilitate the end-to-end processing in big data applications, an established goal in the research agenda set by the Beckman report.",EDBT/ICDT Workshops,2016,citation

In general these systems, while MOSA based, are being extended by surgical cross subsystem updates rather than receiving a clean state transformational upgrade to a unified IMA. Due to spiral funding, these systems were developed and extended incrementally and have 2-3 generations of processing and software infrastructure components on onboard and multiple processing generations for the same subsystem. Deployed systems have program life cycles that include 5-10 years for development, multiple tech refreshes, and life cycle sustainment for 20+ years. In addition, interface definition and standards of hardware and software components have typically been driven by the mixture of existing and new development items and the MOSA profile standards of the time. Still, these deployed avionics systems are being challenged to address providing new capabilities at affordable cost without disruption of the installed base and while accommodating legacy architecture constraints. Today's deployed avionics solutions have dealt with this problem by estimating the future processing, I/O and software infrastructure requirements for these new capabilities and provisioning growth with EOL opportunities. There is never sufficient funding for a complete refresh as a standalone program. A new set of affordability challenges are driving toward ""multicore enabled IMA bridge"" solutions with regard to 1.) inserting IMA multicore pooled processing for SWAP and cost reducing by leveraging Moore's Law 2.) adopting hardware agnostic software environments across subsystems to support reduced life cycle support, 3.) flexibility for supporting mixed legacy, Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE™) conformant, Services Oriented Architecture (SOA), and cross platform domain software for improved reuse and cross platform interoperability, and 4.) addressing I/O migration. To jump start options to addressing these challenges for ""multicore enabled IMA bridge"" solutions, the IT world technologies of Pooled Server Processing, Virtualization, Publish/Subscribe Infrastructure, and I/O Migration can serve as an IMA Bridge for refreshing deployed avionics systems. This paper analyzes a generic avionics system and presents an approach to build this IMA bridge for some simple use cases and presents an IMA ""Figure of Merit"" that can be used in design trade studies.",2014 IEEE/AIAA 33rd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),2014,citation

SoA principles (also known as SoA qualities) attempt to guide development, maintenance, and usage of the SoA. These principles provide benefits like: ease of reuse, service automation, and lowering integration costs. However, they can also lead to security issues. These issues are augmented especially when SoAs are deployed in multi-tenancy third party clouds. SoA has benefited from the existence of cloud computing (CC) as it provided SoA with a flexible deployment medium. However, the advantageous collaboration of SoAs and CC has led to a larger set of privacy and security issues (e.g. compliance issues, QoS issues). Additionally, we observe newer kinds of security and privacy risks that are now required to be monitored and mitigated. In this paper we highlight the security and privacy challenges associated with the utilization of the SoA principles on cloud based solutions. We identify the origin and severity of these issues followed by several recommendations to guide the utilization of SoA principles in off-premise clouds.

With the rapid advancement in Internet technologies and the proliferation of IoT sensors, myriad systems and applications generate data of a massive volume, variety and velocity which traditional databases and systems are unable to manage effectively. Many organizations need to deal with these massive datasets that encounter different types of data (e.g., IoT streaming data, static data) in different formats (e.g., structured, semi-structured) coming from multiple sources. Several data integration mechanisms have been designed to process mostly static data. Unfortunately, these techniques are not able to deal with and integrate IoT streaming datasets from multiple sources. In this paper, we identify the challenges of IoT Streaming Data Integration (ISDI) and present a formal approach for the real-time integration of such IoT streaming datasets. We address one of the important issues of timing conflict/alignment among streaming data coming from multiple sources. A generic window-based ISDI approach is proposed to deal with IoT data in different formats and algorithms are developed to integrate IoT streaming data from multiple sources. In particular, we extend the basic windowing algorithm for real-time data integration and to deal with the timing alignment issue. We also introduce a de-duplication algorithm to deal with data redundancy and to demonstrate the useful fragments of the integrated data. We conduct several sets of experiments and quantify the performance of our proposed window-based approach.

Moreover, it is vital for companies to be as ""smart"" as possible and to adapt to the varying nature of the digital supply chains. This is possible by leveraging IoT in Industry 4.0 scenarios. In this paper, we describe the renovation process, guided by things2i s.r.l., a cross-disciplinary engineering-economic spin-off company of the University of Parma, which a real manufacturing industry is undergoing over consecutive phases spanning a few years. The first phase concerns the digitalization of the control quality process, specifically related to the company's production lines. The use of paper sheets containing different quality checks has been made smarter through the introduction of a digital, smart, and Web-based application, which is currently supporting operators and quality inspectors working on the supply chain through the use of smart devices. The second phase of the IIoT evolution - currently on-going - concerns both digitalization and optimization of the production planning activity, through an innovative Web-based planning tool. The changes introduced have led to significant advantages and improvement for the manufacturing company, in terms of: (i) impressive cost reduction; (ii) better products quality control; (iii) real-time detection and reaction to supply chain issues; (iv) significant reduction of the time spent in planning activity; and (v) resources employment optimization, thanks to the minimization of unproductive setup times on production lines. These two renovation phases represent a basis for possible future developments, such us the integration of sensor-based data on the operational status of production machines and the currently available warehouse supplies. In conclusion, the Industry 4.0-based on-going digitization process guided by things2i allows to continuously collect heterogeneous Human-to-Things (H2T) data, which can be used to optimize the partner manufacturing company as a whole entity.",Front.

However, if existing resource management frameworks in these systems lack the support for storage management, this would cause unpredictable performance degradation when applications are under input/output (I/O) contention. Storage management of data-intensive systems is a challenge. Big Data plays a most major role in storage systems for data-intensive computing. This article deals with these difficulties along with discussion of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, background for storage systems for data-intensive applications, storage patterns and storage mechanisms for Big Data, the Top 10 Cloud Storage Systems for data-intensive computing in today's world, and the interface between Big Data Intensive Storage and Cloud/Fog Computing.

Many of these applications administer data collection on the edge and offer data storage and analytics capabilities in the cloud. This raises the following problems: (i) the processing stages in IoT applications need to have separate implementations for both the edge and the cloud, (ii) the placement of computation is inflexible with separate software stacks, as the optimal deployment decisions need to be made at runtime, and (iii) unified fault tolerance is essential in case of intermittent long-distance network connectivity problems, malicious harming of edge devices, or harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant architecture CEFIoT for IoT applications by adopting state-of-the-art cloud technologies and deploying them also for edge computing. We solve the data fault tolerance issue by exploiting the Apache Kafka publish/subscribe platform as the unified high-performance data replication solution offering a common software stack for both the edge and the cloud. We also deploy Kubernetes for fault-tolerant management and the advanced functionality allowing on-the-fly automatic reconfiguration of the processing pipeline to handle both hardware and network connectivity based failures.",2018 IEEE 4th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),2018,citation

Power Line Communications (PLC) have received a significant attention in the last decade, as electrical lines are not used as simple energy supply media, but as information carriers. Among the different aspects of PLC-based architectures, an interesting and important analysis have to be reserved to security aspects that should be adopted in similar infrastructures, having that they are crucial to deliver trustworthy and reliable systems and, hence, to support users relying on available services, especially in case in which they should be inherently secure at the physical level (e.g. against unauthorised signal removal/interruption and eavesdropping, since they are difficult and dangerous). Motivated by the relevant impact of PLC on IoT, in this chapter we investigate experimentally the performance of IoT systems on PLC in indoor environments, considering a vendor-provided application tool and a self-developed Java library. The experimental tests are carried out on both cold and hot electrical lines, evaluating both fixed-size and variable-length power lines. Our results show that IoT-oriented PLC can reach a throughput of 8 kbps on a 300-m cold line and of 6 kbps on a 300-m hot line.

Designing a data delivery scheme in the future IIoT networks is undoubtedly a challenging task, as it should satisfy several conflicting requirements: massive-scale, data-intensive, and mission-critical, the requirements of which have motivated the desired need for feasible IIoT network architecture. In particular, the traffic characteristics of certain IIoT applications feature small-data patterns especially in typical automation control scenarios such as robot control on the downlink. In order to reduce the huge overhead associated with each individual unicast transmission of the small-data message, we propose a novel “multipoint-to-multipoint” and/or “point-to-multipoint with different contents” communication paradigm—Uni-Multi-Unicast (UMUcast), which is based-on traditional 4G technologies such as evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS) and Group Communication System Enablers (GCSE), and novel 5G technologies such as Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). For the downlink, the UMUcast transmitter can jointly encode multiple-sources’ small-data messages into a single chunk at MEC equipment in conjoint with a gNB, where chunk can be one-off transmission to multiple receivers simultaneously through an eMBMS frame, whereas the chunk is decoded into multiple small-data by each individual IIoT devices separately and respectively. The simulation results show that UMUcast has remarkable improvements over conventional point-to-point unicasting in handling multi-source, multi-destination, and massive small-data delivery with characteristics of low-overhead, high-throughput, and ultra-low-latency for future 5G-based IIoT networks.",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2020,citation

The manufacturing industry undergoes a new age, with significant changes taking place on several fronts. Companies devoted to digital transformation take their future plants inspired by the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is a worldwide network of interrelated physical devices, which is an essential component of the internet, including sensors, actuators, smart apps, computers, mechanical machines, and people. The effective allocation of the computing resources and the carrier is critical in the industrial internet of Things (IIoT) for smart production systems. Indeed, the existing assignment method in the smart production system cannot guarantee that resources meet the inherently complex and volatile requirements of the user are timely. Many research results on resource allocations in auction formats which have been implemented to consider the demand and real-time supply for smart development resources, but safety privacy and trust estimation issues related to these outcomes are not actively discussed.


OBJECTIVES
The paper proposes a Hierarchical Trustful Resource Assignment (HTRA) and Trust Computing Algorithm (TCA) based on Vickrey Clarke-Groves (VGCs) in the computer carriers necessary resources to communicate wirelessly among IIoT devices and gateways, and the allocation of CPU resources for processing information at the CPC.


RESULTS
Finally, experimental findings demonstrate that when the IIoT equipment and gateways are valid, the utilities of each participant are improved.


CONCLUSION
This is an easy and powerful method to guarantee that intelligent manufacturing components genuinely work for their purposes, which want to integrate each element into a system without interactions with each other.",Work,2021,citation

The IoT devices with different functions are integrated and applied to various domains, such as E-health, smart home, Industrial IoT (IIoT), and smart farming. IIoT obtains the general attention among these domains, which allows the authorized user remotely access and control the sensing devices. The user suffices to attain the real-time data collected by sensing devices during the process of production. However, these data is usually transmitted via an insecure channel, which brings the problem of the security and privacy arising from the hostile attacks in IIoT. To resist the hostile attacks by the adversary and protect the security of the transmitted data, we propose a secure multifactor authenticated key agreement scheme for IIoT to support the authorized user remotely accessing the sensing device. The scheme adopts password, biometrics, and smart card to identify the user in the IIoT environment. We employ the secret-sharing technology and Chinese remainder theorem to construct a group key among legitimate sensing devices, and then this group key is utilized to assist in negotiating a secure session key between the user and multiple sensing devices. The proposed scheme is suitable for the resource-constrained IIoT as it only uses hash function, bitwise XOR operation, and symmetric cryptography.

To handle the above issues and challenges, in this article, we integrate mobile-edge computing (MEC) into blockchain-enabled IIoT systems to promote the computation capability of IIoT devices and improve the efficiency of the consensus process. Meanwhile, the weighted system cost, including the energy consumption and the computation overhead, are jointly considered.

Industrial environments are usually huge. The distances between the devices located in them can be vast; in this case, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leads to greater productivity and efficiency of industries. Furthermore, the sensor devices in IIoT have limited memory and constrained processing power, and using gateway nodes is inevitable to cover these vast areas and manage communications between industrial sensors. Security threats such as compromised devices, denial of service, and leakage of confidential information can incur hefty expenses and irreparable damage to industrial systems. Hence, in the IIoT hierarchical architecture, anonymous and mutual authentication between users, gateway nodes, and sensor nodes is essential to protect users and the system’s security and privacy. In this article, we propose a lightweight anonymous privacy-preserving three-factor authentication scheme for WSN-Based IIoT (LAPTAS). In LAPTAS, registered users can use their security smartcard to communicate with sensors and access their data. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports sensor node dynamic registration, password and biometric change, and revocation phase. Additionally, we evaluate and verify our scheme’s security formally using the Real-or-Random model and informally with the automatic cryptographic Protocol Verifier tool(ProVerif).

In everyday life, security, transportation, industry, and healthcare all employ this paradigm. Smart devices have the ability to detect, handle, store, and analyze data, resulting in major network issues such as security and reliability. There are numerous vulnerabilities linked with IoT devices, according to security experts. Prior to performing any activities, it is necessary to identify and classify the device. Device identification and classification in M2M for secure telerobotic surgery are presented in this study. Telerobotics is an important aspect of the telemedicine industry. The major purpose is to provide remote medical care, which eliminates the requirement for both doctors and patients to be in the same location. This paper aims to propose a security and energy-efficient protocol for telerobotic surgeries, which is the primary concern at present. For secure telerobotic surgery, the author presents an Efficient Device type Detection and Classification (EDDC) protocol for device identification and classification in M2M communication. The periodic trust score is calculated using three factors from each sensor node. It demonstrates that the EDDC protocol is more effective and secure in detecting and categorizing rogue devices.",Secur. Commun. Networks,2021,citation

It provides a taxonomy of system requirements for such applications and maps these requirements against the Blockchain’s technological idiosyncrasies.Design/methodology/approachA requirement taxonomy is built in an iterative process based on a descriptive literature review. In total, 223 studies have been screened leading to a relevant sample of 48 publications that were analyzed in detail regarding posed system requirements. Subsequently, Blockchain’s capabilities are discussed for each requirement dimension.FindingsThe paper presents a taxonomy of six requirement dimensions.

In particular, it is able to store data in unalterable blocks, associated with its secure peer-to-peer in a growing problem of transaction authorization in industrial and service provisioning applications. Moreover, it facilitates decentralized transaction (TX) validation and distributed ledger. The underneath algorithm of TX selection for validation may not be effective in terms of delay of various services of the applications. Because the existing random-based or fee-based selections are a delay insensitive that does not guarantee a minimum delay of a time-critical TX. This paper proposes a blockchain-based transaction validation protocol for a secure distributed IoT network. It includes a context-aware TX validation technique, where a TX is validated by a miner with the priority of a service. Besides, we adopt the Software Defined Networking enabled gateway as a middleware between IoT and the blockchain network in which the control operations and security of the network in a largescale are ensured.

In order to guarantee the security and privacy of massive IIoT data, blockchain is widely considered as a promising technology and applied into IIoT. However, there are still several issues in the existing blockchain-enabled IIoT: 1) unbearable energy consumption for computation tasks, 2) poor efficiency of consensus mechanism in blockchain, and 3) serious computation overhead of network systems. To handle the above issues and challenges, in this paper, we integrate mobile edge computing (MEC) into blockchain-enabled IIoT systems to promote the computation capability of IIoT devices and improve the efficiency of consensus process. Meanwhile, the weighted system cost including the energy consumption and the computation overhead are jointly considered. Moreover, we propose an optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems to decrease consumption, and formulate the proposed problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). The master controller, offloading decision, block size and computing server can be dynamically selected and adjusted to optimize the devices energy allocation and reduce the weighted system cost. Accordingly, due to the high-dynamic and large-dimensional characteristics, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to solve the formulated problem.

First, we determine the priority of different QoS requirements of heterogeneous IoT applications at the fog network by enforcing the analytical framework using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Using the AHP, we then formulate a two-sided matching game to initiate stable association between the fog network infrastructure (i.e., fog devices) and IoT devices.

However, the MODBUS TCP is an open de facto standard, and is used for some automation and telecontrol systems. It is based on a polling mechanism and follows the synchronous request–response pattern, as opposed to the asynchronous publish–subscribe pattern. In this study, polling-based and event-based protocols are investigated to realize an open and interoperable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. Many Internet of Things (IoT) protocols are introduced and compared, and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is chosen as the event-based, publish–subscribe protocol. The study shows that MODBUS defines an optimized message structure in the application layer, which is dedicated to industrial applications. In addition, it shows that an event-oriented IoT protocol complements the MODBUS TCP but cannot replace it. Therefore, two scenarios are proposed to build the IIoT environment. The first scenario is to consider the MODBUS TCP as an IoT protocol, and build the environment using the MODBUS TCP on a standalone basis. The second scenario is to use MQTT in conjunction with the MODBUS TCP. The first scenario is efficient and complies with most industrial applications where the request–response pattern is needed only. If the publish–subscribe pattern is needed, the MQTT in the second scenario complements the MODBUS TCP and eliminates the need for a gateway; however, MQTT lacks interoperability. To maintain a homogeneous message structure for the entire environment, industrial data are organized using the structure of MODBUS messages, formatted in the UTF-8, and then transferred in the payload of an MQTT publish message.

The problem is a multi objective optimization with aims of determining the next maximum allowable sampling instant of each control plant and minimizing the power consumption in uplink and downlink, considering the dynamics and desired performance of control plants, the quality of service requirement of RC users, power and sub-carrier constraints. To solve the multi objective optimization problem, a novel approach is proposed which decomposes the optimization problem into two smaller loosely coupled problems. we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulation results.",ArXiv,2019,citation

Due to the diversity of IIoT applications, provisioning of heterogeneous delay requirements of delay-sensitive machine type devices (MTDs) while optimizing the access efficiency of delay-tolerate MTDs becomes a critical challenge for M2M communications. To address this issue, a multigroup analytical framework for massive random access of M2M communications in IIoT is proposed in this article. Specifically, we consider delay-sensitive MTDs and delay-tolerate MTDs coexist in the network, and those MTDs are divided into multiple groups according to their delay requirements. The access behavior of each MTD is characterized by a double-queue model. Based on this model, the throughput and the mean access delay of each group are characterized. It is found that for each group, the mean access delay decreases as the throughput increases and is minimized when the throughput is maximized. To achieve the maximum throughput of delay-tolerate MTDs under delay constraints of delay-sensitive MTDs, the backoff parameters of delay-sensitive MTDs should be tuned according to the delay constraints while that of delay-tolerate MTDs should be tuned further according to the aggregate packet arrival rate and the number of MTDs in each group. It is further demonstrated that the optimal tuning of backoff parameters is robust against the burstiness of input traffic. The analysis sheds important light on the access design of M2M communications in IIoT with delay constraints.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2019,citation

In this context, the application of mechanisms for the auto-configuration of industrial systems may be relevant for reducing human errors and costs in terms of time and money, improving the maintenance and the quality control. OPC UA (OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture) systems are usually integrated into an industrial system to provide a standard way for setting a secure and reliable data exchange between industrial devices of multiple vendors and software systems. In this paper, a novel mechanism for the auto-configuration of OPC UA systems is proposed from an initial setup of industrial devices interconnected to a basic Ethernet network. The auto-configuration of the OPC UA is self-managed over the TCP/IP protocol. This mechanism allows automating the configuration process of the OPC UA server automatically from the programmable logic controller (PLC) devices connected to a basic Ethernet network. Once the PLC devices are identified, they exchange information directly with OPC using a Modbus protocol over the same Ethernet network. To test the feasibility of this approach, a case study is prepared and evaluated.",Electronics,2019,citation

IPAs capabilities are expanding rapidly due to the recent advances on areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial cognition, and ubiquitous computing, which equip the agents with competences to understand what users say, collect information from everyday ubiquitous devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, tablets, laptops, cars, household appliances, etc.), learn user preferences, deliver data-driven search results, and make decisions based on user's context. Apart from the inherent complexity of building such IPAs, developers and researchers have to address many critical architectural challenges (e.g., low-latency, scalability, concurrency, ubiquity, code mobility, interoperability, support to cognitive services and reasoning, to name a few.), thereby diverting them from their main goal: building IPAs. Thus, our contribution in this paper is twofold: 1) we propose an architecture for a platform-agnostic, high-performance, ubiquitous, and distributed middleware that alleviates the burdensome task of dealing with low-level implementation details when building IPAs by adding multiple abstraction layers that hide the underlying complexity; and 2) we present an implementation of the middleware that concretizes the aforementioned architecture and allows the development of high-level capabilities while scaling the system up to hundreds of thousands of IPAs with no extra effort.

In the context of smart grid infrastructure, the strong demand of seamless data transmission during critical events (e.g., failures or natural disturbances) seems to be fundamentally shifting energy attitude toward emerging technology. Therefore, SDN will play a vital role on energy revolution to enable flexible interfacing between smart utility domains and facilitate the integration of mix renewable energy resources to deliver efficient power of sustainable grid. In this regard, we propose a new SDN platform based on IIoT technology to support resiliency by reacting immediately whenever a failure occurs to recover smart grid networks using real-time monitoring techniques. We employ SDN controller to achieve multifunctionality control and optimization challenge by providing operators with real-time data monitoring to manage demand, resources, and increasing system reliability. Data processing will be used to manage resources at local network level by employing SDN switch segment, which is connected to SDN controller through IIoT aggregation node. Furthermore, we address different scenarios to control packet flows between switches on hub-to-hub basis using traffic indicators of the infrastructure layer, in addition to any other data from the application layer.

The paper shows essential disruptive technologies which have determined the change of socio-economic formations of human development: from agrarian societies to industrial and post-industrial ones. The authors of the article have analyzed key disruptive technologies which form the basis for the Internet of Things. Thus, it is stated that the innovations created on the basis of personal computers, mobile phones, Internet, Wi-Fi, renewable energy, 3D printers, digital technology, artificial intelligence, RFID tags, GPS, robots, and «cloud» technologies are the original components of the Internet of Things.

The paper demonstrates the economic view on disruptive technologies as a phenomenon that changes the benefit-cost ratio. The article reveals possible positive and negative effects of the implementation of disruptive technologies. The concept of the so called «the innovator’s dilemma» is discussed, and two principles of disruptive technologies are shown (creative, since it opens a new technological cycle, and destructive, since it undermines the production bases). The authors have empirically estimated the effects of key drivers that impact the average global GDP per capita.

In MEC, resource allocation and network economics need to be jointly addressed to maximize system efficiency and incentivize price-driven agents, whereas this joint problem is under the locality constraints, i.e., an edge server can only serve multiple IIoT MDs in the vicinity constrained by its limited computing resource. In this paper, we investigate the joint problem of network economics and resource allocation in MEC where IIoT MDs request offloading with claimed bids and edge servers provide their limited computing service with ask prices. Particularly, we propose two double auction schemes with dynamic pricing in MEC, namely a breakeven-based double auction (BDA) and a more efficient dynamic pricing based double auction (DPDA), to determine the matched pairs between IIoT MDs and edge servers, as well as the pricing mechanisms for high system efficiency, under the locality constraints. Through theoretical analysis, both algorithms are proved to be budget-balanced, individual profit, system efficient, and truthful.

In practical systems, WCSs would consist of multiple control-loops in general, the resource competition among which would seriously increase mutual interferences and transmission collisions, making it is difficult to provide the required transmission reliability for the control strategy. To address this issue, we design the control strategy together with the hybrid cooperative transmission scheme for multiloop WCSs in a proactive way. We first define the overall system cost function to explore the impacts of standard linear quadratic regulator control cost and wireless transmission reliability on the control performance. In order to further minimize the overall system cost while guaranteeing the control stability, we then propose a control performance aware cooperative transmission scheme, which is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Decomposition method and heuristic algorithms are designed based on the feature of network structure to solve the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem efficiently. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that by using the proposed strategy, the overall system cost is significantly reduced, decreasing by 78% and 82% compared to the cases without considerations of system dynamics and without cooperative transmission, respectively.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,2018,citation

To address this challenge, a two-tier IoT service framework is proposed, where the functionalities provided by smart things are encapsulated into IoT services, which are categorized into service classes. The service network is constructed by considering the invocation possibility between service classes, and service class chains are generated using traditional Web service composition techniques, where the functional specification of certain requirements is considered. Considering factors, such as spatial and temporal-constraints, energy efficiency, and the configurability of IoT services, selecting IoT services for the instantiation of service classes contained in chains is reduced to a multiobjective and multiconstrained optimization problem. Heuristic algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are adopted to search for optimal IoT service compositions. An experimental evaluation shows that PSO performs better than the GA and ACO in searching for approximately optimal IoT service compositions and reduces the energy consumption, thus prolonging the network lifetime.",IEEE Access,2017,citation

For example, a typical IoT application, such as a smart city, includes smarter urban transport networks, upgraded water supply, and waste-disposal facilities, along with more efficient ways to light and heat buildings. For smart city applications and others, we require unique naming of every object and a secure, scalable, and efficient name resolution which can provide access to any object’s inherent attributes with its name. Based on different motivations, many naming principles and name resolution schemes have been proposed. Some of them are based on the well-known domain name system (DNS), which is the most important infrastructure in the current Internet, while others are based on novel designing principles to evolve the Internet. Although the DNS is evolving in its functionality and performance, it was not originally designed for the IoT applications.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: This paper presents a route level content based store-and forward packet routing algorithm for Wireless Human Area Networks in distributed cloud environment. Findings: A prototype WHAN has been built for symbolizing on-body topology disconnections in the presence of ultra-short range wireless links (Cloud), volatile RF dilution, and humanoid motion.

Here, an Adaptive-point framework is created within the Cloud architecture, targeting to deliver reliable routing service for WHAN-inter body communication, where each HAN node functions as a mobile service node and predicts its future locations by generating Adaptive point messages, which describe the route of the node's movement. Semi-cloud module in cloud collects the Adaptive point information and makes decision for inter communication WHAN nodes.

Name Resolution is the center of attraction for ICN, where Named Data Objects (NDO) are used for identifying the information and guiding for routing or forwarding inside ICN. Recently, several researches use distributed NRS to overcome the problem of interest flooding, congestion and overloading. Yet the distribution of NRS is based on random distribution. How to distribute the NRS is still an important and challenging problem. In this work, we address the problem of distribution of NRS by proposing a new mechanism called Distributed Name Resolution System (DNRS), by considering the time of publishing the NDOs in the NRS. This mechanism partitions the network to distribute the workload among NRSs by increasing storage capacity. In addition, partitioning...",,2016,citation

, Publish-Subscribe Internet Technology (PURSUIT) presents a flexible networking architecture for the domain based content management and source-routing based content addressing. However, with the development of mobile Internet, how to extend PURSUIT for supporting efficient and scalable mobility management is vital for its actual deployment. In this paper, we propose a new mobility management scheme for both a subscriber and a publisher in a PURSUIT architecture. The proposed scheme is based on a proxy, which is dynamically selected in a distributed manner at the branching point. A network based fast handover procedure is also integrated to guarantee a mobile user’s better handover experience in the proposed scheme. Based on our designed analytic model, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the handover latency compared with that in the basic PURSUIT case. Besides, the required handover preparation time and the induced extra signaling cost are also analyzed.",Wirel. Networks,2016,citation

We propose a distributed mobility management scheme for both the mobile receiver and the mobile publisher in NDN.

In ICN, the content items are stored temporarily in network nodes such as routers. When the memory of routers becomes full and there is no room for a new 
arriving content, the stored contents are evicted to cope with the limited cache size of the routers. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an effective caching strategy for keeping popular contents for a longer period of time. This study proposes a new caching strategy, named Flexible Popularity-based Caching (FlexPop) for storing popular contents. 
The FlexPop comprises two mechanisms, i.e., Content Placement Mechanism (CPM), which is responsible for content caching, and Content Eviction Mechanism 
(CEM) that deals with content eviction when the router cache is full and there is no space for the new incoming content. Both mechanisms are validated using Fuzzy Set Theory, following the Design Research Methodology (DRM) to manifest that the research is rigorous and repeatable under comparable conditions. The performance of FlexPop is evaluated through simulations and the results are compared with those of the Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE), ProbCache, and Most Popular Content (MPC) strategies. The results show that the FlexPop strategy outperforms LCE, ProbCache, 
and MPC with respect to cache hit rate, redundancy, content retrieval delay, memory utilization, and stretch ratio, which are regarded as extremely important metrics (in various studies) for the evaluation of ICN caching. The outcomes exhibited in this study are noteworthy in terms of making FlexPop acceptable to users as they can verify 
the performance of ICN before selecting the right caching strategy. Thus FlexPop has potential in the use of ICN for the future Internet such as in deployment of the IoT technology.",,2016,citation

However, the IP based current Internet communication model is considered as inappropriate for supporting an explosive increase of Internet devices and contents in the Future Internet. To address the communication model issue, Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed that allows a consumer only cares about what he wants but not where the content is. Although NDN designs an ideal communication model for the content-intensive Future Internet, it assumes a clean-slate deployment, which would take a long time for deployment. The coexistence of the NDN paradigm and the current Internet is thus expected. In this vein, we propose a new scheme that utilizes current DNS protocols for content naming and addressing in a NDN environment.

Accessing contents and services require the mapping of what users care about to where the content is located. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm in networking and a future Internet architecture which treats content as the primitive decoupling location from identity, security and access to retrieve content by name. Together with built-in capabilities for caching content, multi-path communications, disruption tolerance and security, ICN is able to leverage advancements in technology to address the issues associated with the mismatch between today’s network use and network architecture. There are a number of ICN architectures, viz., Network of Information (NetInf), Publish-Subscribe Internet Routing Paradigm (PSIRP), Data Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) and Content Centric Networking (CCN) being developed by researchers worldwide with the ultimate focus of replacing the current Internet. CCN, a ""Clean Slate"" architecture to ICN, uses new approaches to routing named content, achieving scalability, security and performance. Most computing devices of today (user devices as well as in the core network) are equipped with multiple networking interfaces and hence, have the ability to use multiple paths within or over different networks. The widest possible experience in using multi-path is mostly available in Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) based networks and the research done shows that multi-path routing can achieve robustness, load balancing, congestion reduction, low power consumption, and higher throughput. CCN, which has built-in capabilities to handle multiple networking attachments proposes two forwarding strategies, viz., the standard strategy which replicates network traffic into multiple paths and the best-face strategy which uses the discovered multiple paths one at a time, alternatively. However, these forwarding strategies do not exploit the full potential of CCN, especially the multi-path capability to improve performance in CCN based networks. The main objective of this thesis therefore, is to identify a set of mechanisms that capitalize on the multipath capability of CCN to improve the overall performance of user applications and the deployed networks.",,2015,citation

In ICN, content -rather than hosts, like in IP-based design- plays the central role in the communications. This change from host-centric to content-centric has several significant advantages such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency, scalability, etc. One of the main design requirements for the ICN architectures -since the beginning of their design- has been strong security. 
Named Data Networking (NDN) (also referred to as Content-Centric Networking (CCN) or Data-Centric Networking (DCN)) is one of these architectures that are the focus of an ongoing research effort that aims to become the way Internet will operate in the future. Existing research into security of NDN is at an early stage and many designs are still incomplete. To make NDN a fully working system at Internet scale, there are still many missing pieces to be filled in. In this dissertation, we study the four most important security issues in NDN in order to defense against new forms of -potentially unknown- attacks, ensure privacy, achieve high availability, and block malicious network traffics belonging to attackers or at least limit their effectiveness, i.e., anomaly detection, DoS/DDoS attacks, congestion control, and cache pollution attacks. In order to protect NDN infrastructure, we need flexible, adaptable and robust defense systems which can make intelligent -and real-time- decisions to enable network entities to behave in an adaptive and intelligent manner. In this context, the characteristics of Computational Intelligence (CI) methods such as adaption, fault tolerance, high computational speed and error resilient against noisy information, make them suitable to be applied to the problem of NDN security, which can highlight promising new research directions. Hence, we suggest new hybrid CI-based methods to make NDN a more reliable and viable architecture for the future Internet.",,2015,citation

So the communication can be more in effect if the customers can simply identify that what content they want to have instead of from where the content can be possessed. To achieve this and also to make the system more efficient and effective, new internet architecture emerged which we baptized as “Named Data Networking” or simply “NDN” in which packets bring with it the hierarchical data names instead of carrying the source and destination address. In NDN when the customer needs some data, he sends the interest packet which carries the name, is first received by the router and the router then forwards it as per instructed by FIB and uphold the status of pending interest , in further which is used for guiding the retrieved data back to the customer. The main objectives behind developing this architecture are to bring the scalability, efficiency, security and robustness in the current internet state, facilitating the user choice and competition as well. In this paper an overview of different future internet architectural approaches are provided such as CCN, NetInf, PRISP and DONA. NDN as a brand new architectural design among them remains the leading focus and its altered architectural design as a source of fulfilling the above mentioned major issues and objectives.

We propose a network architecture called Data-centric Network (DCN) where communication is done using a data identifier (ID) and the dynamic data registered by mobile terminals can be retrieved by specifying the data ID. DCN mitigates the problems of prior arts, which are large size of routing table and transaction load of name resolution service. DCN introduces concept of route attraction and aggregation in which the related routes are attracted to an aggregation point and aggregated to reduce routing table size, and route optimization in which optimized routes are established routes to reduce access transaction load to the aggregation points. These allow the proposed architecture to deal with ever increasing number of data and terminals with frequent mobility and changes in data.",IEICE Trans. Commun.,2013,citation

Therefore, unlike existing Internet communication technologies focused on the process of communication using the host address, ICN focuses on the purpose of communication for each information by defining the information of everything that exists on the Internet. For this purpose, ICN uses NbR (Name-based Routing) methods that assign a name to each piece of information, all routers participating in ICN have the physical storage so that they are able to share information with each other. NbR methods on ICN are divided into one-phase routing and two-phase routing depending on how to reach at the storage of each router. However, currently proposed NbR methods cause many problems because they do not reflect the unique characteristics of ICN. Therefore, this paper looked at various NbR issues from caching, access time, distribution, mobility, scaliability, and dissemination of information for an efficient NbR method, and analyzed existing methods proposed for ICN.

Several researches are carried out for NDN recently, but the user-side mobility problem is not considered sufficiently. To enhance seamless user-side mobility support in the NDN architecture, we propose a Proactive Caching approach for NDN (PCNDN), which is based on the idea that proactively requests and caches the content items that a user does not receive but were requested before a handover process. Thus, once the user reconnects to the network, it can immediately fetch the content items that were transmitted during its disconnection period. Compared with the original NDN, the analytical and simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has lower handover cost, higher delivery ratio and shorter handover latency. Moreover, the proposed approach prevents unnecessary packet losses on the path towards the old location of the user, alleviates negative effects of user-side mobility on real-time services.",2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing,2013,citation

To study the impacts of various cache policies on overall performance of ICN network, we formulate the in- network caching problem of ICN into Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem. Furthermore, we infer that frequency-based cache policies like LFU are supposed to perform well by analyzing the properties of optimal cache assignment, which is corroborated by our simulation results. We attempt to explore the impact of the distance between cache and the original content on cache policy performance by posing a novel cache policy named LB (Least Benefit), which takes into account the distance factor besides frequency. Through extensive simulations under various scenarios and configurations, we find that the performance gain brought by LB is limited in comparison to that of LFU, which implies that more sophisticated cache policies involving the distance factor should be considered to improve LFU. Our simulation results also show that, under a reasonable setting of cache size and request pattern, the average hops to get content can be reduced significantly by nearly 50% in comparison to that of the scenario without in- network caching.",2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),2012,citation

Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is one of the important ICN methodologies, which defines a new transport for content request and response packets. For the operation of CCN data plane, it is normally assumed that a control plane based on a routing protocol such as OSPF is used. While routing protocols such as OSPF are quite suitable for the interoperation between the legacy IP network and CCN network, such protocols are not suitable for supporting content mobility because of their slow convergence time. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest a control plane that supports content mobility with a very simple extension to the original CCN message formats.",2012 14th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT),2012,citation

This architecture is based on the concept of decoupling data from location and retrieving contents by name instead of location. Transport layer protocol i.e. CCNx has been proposed for use with CCN. CCNx performs longest prefix match between requested content name and entries stored in Forwarding Information Base (FIB) table of CCN router. A request is discarded if no match is found between them. CCN routers will be required to maintain a large number of entries in FIB table due to shifting of address space from one billion IPs to at least one trillion content names. Currently, CCN routers cannot store mapping for all content names in FIB table. This will cause large number of FIB's misses and can lead to deadlock situation despite the fact that requested content might be held by a nearby router. In this paper, we have accessed suitability of using different alternatives of blind routing algorithms as a fall back scheme for CCNx when FIB miss occurs. We have implemented different blind routing algorithms i.e. flooding, expanding ring and random walk over CCNx in an OPNET simulator using C language. Matrices of routing overhead, end-to-end delay and success rate have been used for making comparisons. Our results suggest that random walk with queries sent on half of the total links can be used as fall back scheme to avoid deadlock problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a simulation study of blind routing algorithms over CCNx architecture has been carried out.",2012 International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE),2012,citation

Beethoven's Ninth is a large media file with perpetual validity that is typically accessed on demand by users. By contrast, a storm warning is a small ephemeral message typically pushed by the weather service to all users in a specific geographic area. We argue that both should and would be well supported by an information-centric network. More specifically we argue three points. First, modern applications, reflecting the nature of human communications, use and transmit large and long-lived files as well as small ephemeral messages. Second, accessing those two types of information involves significantly different operations within the network. Third, despite their differences, both types of information would benefit from an addressing scheme based on content rather than on more or less flat identifiers, which means that both should be integrated to some extent within a unified content-based routing infrastructure.",ICN '11,2011,citation

As a first study in 2008 revealed, energy consumption of such data centers is becoming a critical problem, since their power consumption is about to double every 5 years. However, a recently (2016) released follow-up study points out that this threatening trend was dramatically throttled within the past years, due to the increased energy efficiency actions taken by data center operators. Furthermore, the authors of the study emphasize that making and keeping data centers energy-efficient is a continuous task, because more and more computing power is demanded from the same or an even lower energy budget, and that this threatening energy consumption trend will resume as soon as energy efficiency research efforts and its market adoption are reduced. An important class of applications running in data centers are data management systems, which are a fundamental component of nearly every application stack. While those systems were traditionally designed as disk-based databases that are optimized for keeping disk accesses as low a possible, modern state-of-the-art database systems are main memory-centric and store the entire data pool in the main memory, which replaces the disk as main bottleneck. To scale up such in-memory database systems, non-uniform memory access (NUMA) hardware architectures are employed that face a decreased bandwidth and an increased latency when accessing remote memory compared to the local memory. In this thesis, we investigate energy awareness aspects of large scale-up NUMA systems in the context of in-memory data management systems. To do so, we pick up the idea of a fine-grained data-oriented architecture and improve the concept in a way that it keeps pace with increased absolute performance numbers of a pure in-memory DBMS and scales up on NUMA systems in the large scale. To achieve this goal, we design and build ERIS, the first scale-up in-memory data management system that is designed from scratch to implement a data-oriented architecture. With the help of the ERIS platform, we explore our novel core concept for energy awareness, which is Energy Awareness by Adaptivity. The concept describes that software and especially database systems have to quickly respond to environmental changes (i.e., workload changes) by adapting themselves to enter a state of low energy consumption. We present the hierarchically organized Energy-Control Loop (ECL), which is a reactive control loop and provides two concrete implementations of our Energy Awareness by Adaptivity concept, namely the hardware-centric Resource Adaptivity and the software-centric Storage Adaptivity. Finally, we will give an exhaustive evaluation regarding the scalability of ERIS as well as our adaptivity facilities.",,2017,citation

Our algorithm is arbitrarily scalable due to a careful design that controls computational complexity, space complexity, and communication. In practice, we commonly process hypergraphs with billions of vertices and hyperedges in a few hours. We explain how the algorithm's scalability, both in terms of hypergraph size and bucket count, is limited only by the number of machines available. We perform an extensive comparison to existing distributed hypergraph partitioners and find that our approach is able to optimize hypergraphs roughly 100 times bigger on the same set of machines.

As deployment has increased, so too has the number of researchers seeking to improve the overall analytical environment by way of tools and models. Although much work has been done, there are still many uninvestigated areas; two of which are explored in this dissertation. The first pertains to the physical storage of the data itself. There are two generally accepted storage models: relational and entity-attribute-value (EAV). For clinical data, EAV systems are preferred due to their natural way of managing manyto-many relationships, sparse attributes, and dynamic processes along with minimal conversion effort and reduction in federation complexities. However, the relational database management systems on which they are implemented are not intended to organize and retrieve data in this format; eroding their performance gains. To combat this effect, we present the foundation for an EAV Database Management System (EDBMS). We discuss data conversion methodologies, formulate the requisite metadata and partitioned type-sensing index structures, and provide detailed runtime and experimental analysis with five extant methods. Our results show that the prototype, EAVDB, reduces space and conversion requirements while enhancing overall query performance. The second topic concerns query performance in a federated environment. One method used to decrease query execution time is to pre-compute and store “ben-",,2013,citation

A recent study shows that improves and evaluates data warehouse success is one of the top concerns facing IT/DW executives. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research that addresses the issue of the data warehouse systems success. In addition, it is important for organizations to learn about quality needs to be emphasized before the actual data warehouse is built. It is also important to determine what aspects of data warehouse systems success are critical to organizations to help IT/DW executives to devise effective data warehouse success improvement strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further the understanding of the factors which are critical to evaluate the success of data warehouse systems. The study attempted to develop a comprehensive model for the success of data warehouse systems by adapting the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model. Researcher models the relationship between the quality factors on the one side and the net benefits of data warehouse on the other side. This study used quantitative method to test the research hypotheses by survey data. The data were collected by using a web-based survey. The sample consisted of 244 members of The Data Warehouse Institution (TDWI) working in variety industries around the world. The questionnaire measured six independent variables and one dependent variable. The independent variables were meant to measure system quality, information quality, service quality, relationship quality, user quality, and business quality. The dependent variable was meant to measure the net benefits of data warehouse systems. Analysis using descriptive analysis, factor analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis resulted in the support of all hypotheses. The research results indicated that there are statistically positive causal relationship between each quality factors and the net benefits of the data warehouse systems. These results imply that the net benefits of the data warehouse systems increases when the overall qualities were increased. Yet, little thought seems to have been given to what the data warehouse success is, what is necessary to achieve the success of data warehouse, and what benefits can be realistically expected. Therefore, it appears nearly certain and plausible that the way data warehouse systems success is implemented in the future could be changed.",,2012,citation

Data warehouse systems have emerged as the core of management information systems. Data warehouse is part of a larger infrastructure that includes legacy data sources, external data sources, data acquisition software, a repository, analytical tools, and user interface. The difficulties of data warehouse implementations have been widely cited in the literature but research on the factors for initial and ongoing data warehouse implementation success is rare and fragmented. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, 10 factors were found to be critical to DW implementation success — Organizational, Technical, Project, Environmental, Infrastructure, Information Quality, System Quality, Service Quality, Relationship Quality, and Net Benefits.

The effect of the adoption degree among the personnel, and in making decisions was evaluated. The process of adoption of the data warehouse in the case studied in this work reduces time, which causes an increase in the accuracy and precision of decision making. This is shown by the 93.9% profit. However, the study also shows that the maximum potentialities of the data warehouse are not fully used.",,2009,citation

One of the key architectural issues concerning the efficient design of a data warehouse is to determine the â€œrightâ€ number of views to be materialized in order to minimize the query response time experienced by the decision makers in the organization. We consider a bottleneck objective in designing such a materialization scheme which has the effect of guaranteeing a certain level of performance. We examine linear integer programming formulations, and develop heuristics and report on the performance of these heuristics. We also evaluate heuristics reported in the literature for the view materialization problem with a simpler objective.",J. Database Manag.,2007,citation

This paper presents a metadata-based approach to facilitate the generation, transformation, sharing and usage of data and knowledge among multiple heterogeneous EMI applications. A metadata-based framework for EMI development has been developed, which provides a range of solutions for mining the metadata from general data sources, and then integrating and migrating the metadata among various data sources. A mechanism has been developed for the automatic binding of metadata and data into EMI applications. A prototype tool was developed to scale up the proposed approach. Case studies have shown that the approach and the prototype tool are efficient and have the potential to deal with industrial level applications","First International Conference on Innovative Computing, Information and Control - Volume I (ICICIC'06)",2006,citation

Today, the success of how some companies use information for competitive advantage and operational effectiveness (e.g., Wal-Mart, Dell) is causing business leaders to look more carefully at how well their firms are leveraging information. Furthermore, web technology makes it both technically and financially feasible to deliver literally millions of pages of text to desktops as needed. The technologies available to manage different types of information are also improving rapidly and converging. Software, while still imperfect, is therefore opening the door to a host of new possibilities for information management and delivery. These factors are placing new pressures on IT to focus more thoughtfully on the information component of their function. This paper explores how IT’s role in information delivery is changing and evolving in organizations. It first surveys the rapidly expanding world of information and technology and why information delivery became so important so rapidly. Then, it discusses the value proposition of information in organizations. Next it describes the important components of an effective information delivery function in IT. Finally, it looks at how information delivery will likely evolve over the next five to ten years and what this will mean for IT and organizations. The paper concludes that information delivery in IT is an idea whose time has finally come. For the first time, senior business executives are ready to hear about the value of information. However, the challenges for IT are huge. Not only does effective information delivery require new technologies, it also means that IT must develop new internal non-technical and analytic capabilities and makes its work much more visible in the organization.",Commun.

Prof,"In the justified euphoria over the Web information retrieval, the extremely valuable experiences of librarian science, accumulated since the most remote antiquity, seem to be utterly neglected. Even the most elementary rules, such as the primary and secondary level of information sources, are often confounded. The spreading of information literacy is very useful, but this process does not necessarily mean that the graduates have acquired all the cultural and scientific knowledge indispensable for efficient information seeking performances. Although information providers cannot assume the whole responsibility of the educational system, but by setting up fully automated interactive communicative search systems that are coupled with the reference librarians’ constant personal assistance, a great deal of search mistakes can be eliminated. In this context, metadata systems should play a more important role because their content and knowledge organizational functions not only help non-specialist Web users to formulate competent queries, but they efficiently overcome paradigmal barriers hindering intercultural information exchange. Web users in their information retrieval attempts are also greatly hampered by the fact that search engines, databases and content providers offer an astonishingly disparate array of search tools and interfaces, despite the existence of the CCL (Common Command Language). Until the time when a genuinely global standardization can take place – encompassing the whole scale and scope of information retrieval, it will be impossible to remedy the above-mentioned detrimental conditions merely by fostering new inventions.",,2003,citation

ECM includes the strategies, tools, processes, and skills an organization needs to manage its information assets over their lifecycle. While many vendors would suggest that their software is a panacea, most knowledge managers recognize the greater challenge – to develop an overall ECM strategy that will ensure good information practices are in place and effectively integrated with technology where appropriate. An effective ECM strategy should address each of the four lifecycle stages: 1. Capture – all activities associated with collecting content. 2. Organize – indexing, classifying and linking content and databases together to provide access within and across business units and functions. 3. Process – sifting and analyzing content in ways that inform decision-making. 4. Maintain – ensuring that content is kept up-to-date. A guiding principle at all stages is flexibility. Methods of collecting, organizing, processing and maintaining content that “casts it in concrete” could become a liability in the near future. While the top-down vision for ECM includes improved decision-making, better utilization of information and the collection of competitive intelligence, most ECM initiatives take a bottom-up approach that focuses on delivering immediate benefits through projects such as intranet portals, information searching, and web content management. However, knowledge managers also recognize that greater value can be gained from taking a more strategic approach to ECM. The research shows that those organizations that can marry effective content stewardship practices with appropriate information behaviors and values and information technology on a broader scale can have a significant effect on their organization’s performance.",Commun.
