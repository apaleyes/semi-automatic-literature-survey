This new architecture brings both new problems to be solved and also natural solutions to existing problems. This paper investigates an intra-domain traffic engineering (TE) problem for an information-centric networking (ICN) architecture where a form of source routing is used as the forwarding mechanism. The TE goal is to maximise the residual capacity in the network so that the load is spread evenly. A network flow approach is used and it is shown that the source routing mechanism allows the traffic to be split across multiple paths in a manner that is difficult to achieve using existing IP or IP/MPLS networks. Allowing splittable flows means that a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme can be used that has superior results when compared to existing constraint based routing schemes for flows that cannot be split. Consequently, this work demonstrates that the ICN architecture can simplify the given TE problem in a natural manner.",excluded

Such network designs show the requirements of energy efficiency, availability, high performance, and data-aware intelligence. To meet these requirements, we adopt the information-centric networking (ICN) approach, where data are retrieved through names and in-network caching is utilized. However, as the typical existing ICN architectures, content centric network (CCN) cannot efficiently utilize the caches for data sharing because of the on-path caching strategy, and network of information (NetInf) demonstrates the resolution latency for data retrievals. To design an efficient and effective ICN architecture for big data sharing, we combine the strong points of CCN and NetInf, where information islands (IOIs) and management plane are utilized for direct data retrieval and global data discovery, respectively. We provide a reference architecture and propose an aggregatable name-based routing (ANBR), which can naturally enable consumers to retrieve the closest copy of information. In this network, each piece of data can be cached at one IOI at most once, which greatly improves the efficiency of cache usages. The consumers first try to retrieve the data in the local IOI, and then try to globally retrieve it from the closest IOI, holding the copy of the data if necessary. We investigate the impact from the key factor, IOI size, to the energy consumption of ANBR. It shows that energy consumption first decreases and then increases as the IOI size increases, and the optimized IOI size can be found for deployment. Furthermore, we study the relation between the optimized IOI size and the average retrieval times for the data. The result shows that the optimized IOI size increases as the average retrieval times increase.",excluded

These challenges stem from the increasing incorporation of distributed renewable energy sources on to the grid, the rising deployment of electric vehicles, and active consumer participation into power grid operations, all of which communicate with the utility control center with varying degrees of priority and security. To address these challenging requirements, we propose SeDAX, a SEcure Data-centric Application eXtensible platform for Smart Grid applications. SeDAX implements scalable, resilient and secure data delivery and data sharing in a wide area network. The platform can scalably handle high volumes of data generated by both applications and sensors. The SeDAX architecture has as its basis a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) network. The properties of the DT graph are leveraged to scalably support secure data-centric (or information-centric) group communication. The primary goals of this platform are to support communication resilience and data availability. The key functional blocks of the SeDAX platform are: (1) a geographic hash forwarding algorithm that operates over the DT graph (DT-GHF), and (2) a DT-based data replication scheme. The forwarding and replication schemes are scalable and cost effective in terms of communication overhead and memory. We describe the design details of the SeDAX platform and present empirical results on the performance of SeDAX as compared with other geometric-based alternatives such as Geographic Hash Table (GHT) forwarding and Content Addressable Networking (CAN). The operation of SeDAX is illustrated in the context of implementing demand response, a known Smart Grid application.",architecture

This situation reflects the actual reality better: data is shared directly among users without the need of centralized sources. Three key facts distinguish DOA from existing approaches: First, DOA does not bind data to a specific location. Data is defined by the application which produced it and not an address of a location where it is currently stored. Second, DOA is a holistic approach that comprises a suitable data structure, data access methods and a message exchange protocol. Thus, DOA can be easily implemented and used right away. Third, in DOA, users can decide which data they want to keep private and which data they want to share.

However, recent internet statistics show that content-oriented traffic (e.g. web pages, multimedia clips) becomes more and more dominant. Even though content-oriented networking has received increasing attention, there have been few comprehensive and quantitative studies on how to realize a content-oriented networking framework. In this paper, we focus on the operational issues of the new networking framework: (i) how to locate contents, (ii) how to deliver contents, and (iii) how to cache contents. There are two major infrastructure alternatives in substantiating these mechanisms: a tree and a distributed hash table (DHT). We carry out comprehensive simulation experiments to compare these alternatives in terms of content transfer latency, cache effectiveness, and failure resilience. I. I NTRODUCTION The Internet has evolved from a small-scale academic testbed into a crucial social infrastructure. For 40 years since its inception, the Internet has tried to accommodate new and unanticipated requirements. However, its rigid design based on TCP/IP, internet service providers’ exclusive control of networks and so on have ossified the Internet [6]. One of the Internet design principles that hinders the current Internet evolution is the host-oriented communications. That is, the early stage Internet applications, such as remote login, file transfer, and e-mail, focused strictly on host-to-host communications, where an end user explicitly directs his/her host to communicate with another host. Over the past several years, however, the vast majority of Internet usage has become data retrieval and service access [23], [3], [16] (i.e.,data-orientedusage), where an end user cares about contents 1 but is oblivious to or less aware of the host (or its location) [16]. For example, (i) many people often use search engines like Google from which they jump to the data or service page irrespective of the location in which the desired data/service resides, (ii) web intermediaries such as web caches and content delivery networks (CDNs) [18] transparently redirect web clients to a nearby copy of the requested data without contacting the original Web server, and (iii) peer-to-peer (P2P) applications enable users to search and 1In this paper, we use “data” and “contents” almost interchangeably. In the literature, “contents” often have more semantics than “data”. retrieve the data without making them know the location or identity of the host. The common viable contribution of search engines, web caching, CDNs, and P2P applications is that they all seek to support data-oriented applications. They improve the data availability, ease-of-use, performance, and scalability of applications by overcoming the limitations of the host-oriented principles of the legacy Internet by manipulating DNS naming and/or name resolution. In other words, they decouple content files from their locations (or hosts) using various techniques such as caching, replication with transparent request redirection, maintenance of a searching infrastructure, etc. [16]. Recently, lessons from these several application/servicedependent ad-hoc solutions, have motivated “clean-slate” efforts [1], [16], [10], termed data-oriented or content-centric networking, which strive to redesign the host-oriented Internet to accommodate more and more dominant data-oriented Internet usage at the architectural level. The essence of contentoriented networking lies in decoupling contents from the service host/location not at application levels, but at networking levels. That is, content-oriented networking shifts the focus from transmitting data between two hosts (or their locations) to delivering data via a content identifier 2. The content-oriented networking architecture is expected to (i) free application/service developers from re-inventing the necessary mechanisms, and (ii) provide scalable and efficient delivery of the requested contents. However, there have been few studies that how to substantiate the content-oriented networking infrastructure in terms of performance metrics. In order to address the operational issues that are missing in the recent architectural studies on content-oriented networking in the literature, this paper explores two alternatives for content-oriented network infrastructures: a hierarchical tree and a flat distributed hash table (DHT). Whether we choose a tree or a DHT for the infrastructure affects almost every aspect of network operations: name resolution, content delivery, caching, and so on. We will compare these two alternatives in terms of scalability, robustness, transfer latency thoroughly. 2As an example, the Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) [16] r places endpoint-based DNS by a new name resolution mechanism using flat, certifying names and name-based anycast primitives above the IP layer.",excluded

However, prior studies on energy sustainability has paid little attention on prosumer involvement and management. Likewise, the continuous growth of cities has increased data processing complexity. Consequently, processing and analysis of historical, online, and real-time streaming data from energy sensors and metering devices has become a major issue in smart cities. Therefore, this research aims to present an architecture based on big data to improve energy prosumption in smart community districts by applying enterprise architecture approach grounded on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF). Accordingly, qualitative methodology is adopted to collect data by employing case study by focus group interview from two energy companies in Norway to preliminarily validate the architecture.

DCN mitigates the problems of prior arts, which are large size of routing table and transaction load of name resolution service. DCN introduces concept of route attraction and aggregation in which the related routes are attracted to an aggregation point and aggregated to reduce routing table size, and route optimization in which optimized routes are established routes to reduce access transaction load to the aggregation points.

In this paper, a novel network architecture called Energy Efficient and Enhanced-type Data-centric Network (E 3 -DCN) is proposed for ICN. E 3 -DCN not only realizes ICN but also has the ability of data generation by organizing and combining relevant resource such as original data and kinds of processing services. In addition, in order to improve energy efficiency of data transmission, E 3 -DCN chooses optimal transmission path to transmit data based on packet switching and optical switching. Moreover, based on current traffic situation, E 3 -DCN reconfigures network topology such as unused nodes and links to operate in sleep mode for energy saving dynamically. And meanwhile, data caching strategies are applied into E 3 -DCN for data distribution based on the distribution of users. Data caching shortens transmission distance, so data transmission energy, latency and network load is decreased. Based on these approaches, E 3 -DCN achieves an energy efficient network.",excluded
