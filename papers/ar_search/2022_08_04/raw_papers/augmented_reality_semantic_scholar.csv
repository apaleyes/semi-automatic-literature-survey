In this article, we provide solutions to resource orchestration and management for applications over a virtualized client-edge-server infrastructure. We investigate the problem of optimal placement of pipelines of application functions (virtual service chains) and the steering of traffic through them, over a multi-technology edge network model consisting of both wired and wireless millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. This problem is $\mathcal {NP}$ -hard. We provide a comprehensive “microscopic” binary integer program to model the system, along with a heuristic that is one order of magnitude faster than optimally solving the problem. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of orchestrating virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity. Moreover, we observe significant gains when deploying a small number of mmWave links that complement the Wire physical infrastructure in high node density networks.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2021.0,10.1109/TNSM.2021.3050009,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Such is the case of Fog computing, which extends from the well-known Cloud computing paradigm by bringing processing, communications, and storage capabilities to the edge of the network. By offering these novel features, also new challenges emerge that call for the design and implementation of orchestration mechanisms to deal with resource management. One of these mechanisms is related to the service placement, which consists in the selection of the appropriate execution node for the applications according to a specific optimization objective. In this paper, an Integer Linear Programming model for service placement aimed at latency reduction of popular applications is proposed. Furthermore, a heuristic based on the PageRank algorithm, called Popularity Ranked Placement, is also introduced. Simulation results show that the heuristic has lower execution times and is able to better balance the load in the network nodes, while being close to the ILP-based solution latency levels.",2020 IFIP Networking Conference (Networking),2020.0,,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

In such distributed environments, service providers will typically face tens, hundreds, or thousands of compute location candidates (edge, regional, and central) where network service components can be placed. To take optimized placement decisions of network services and execute the management workflows, orchestration systems require up-to-date and accurate resource availability representation, in the form of a network inventory that can be immense in distributed cloud scenarios. As a result, the service management and placement problems may become not tractable. In this work, we propose the Abstracted Network Inventory (ANI) component to generate service-optimized network views over the same network inventory. ANI implements a novel abstraction method where network service requirements are used as an input to generate an optimized abstract network inventory representation, called Logical Network Inventory (LNI). We also provide a formal definition of the network model and problem statement along with the development of three algorithms to efficiently build an LNI. Results show the potential benefits of using an LNI to streamline service management and placement: (i) the relationship between compute nodes and links (i.e., density) in an LNI is reduced between 1.8-2.7x compared to a full network inventory topology; and (ii) up to 50% of time can be saved for service placement after abstracting around 20% of the compute nodes.",2020 6th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft),2020.0,10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165443,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

To achieve this, a trade-off between the accuracy, latency, and energy consumption of each MD is considered as intertwined costs. Accordingly, we minimize a sum of intertwined costs including the energy consumption, latency and accuracy loss of multiple MDs, while satisfying the maximum latency constraint and the minimum accuracy constraint of each MAR application. With rigorous analysis, we design a theoretical framework for the optimization of MD performance by jointly managing the frame resolution of the image to offload to the MEC server from MDs, and the computation capacity distribution over MDs in the case of the limited computation capacity of the MEC server. Our numerical analysis validates that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the number of service-level agreement violations, such as exceeding the maximum latency constraint, compared with the existed algorithm. Specifically, the proposed work significantly improve costs of service latency, accuracy loss, and energy consumption of MDs for MEC-assisted MAR services compared with baseline schemes.",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,2020.0,10.1109/TVT.2020.3020982,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

How to capture insights underneath these data in a smart city context is gaining great attention nowadays. In this article, we introduce a highly function-differentiated metropolitan scenario, which is covered by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as cache-enabled edge computing nodes. With the help of wireless backhaul technology, coverage capability of UAV can be dynamically configured through smart 3-D placement, where trajectories of two types of UAVs are optimized. A social augmented reality (AR)-based use case is proposed and discussed in the proposed scenario, from which we derive the fundamental mechanisms and strategies to maintain a green and sustainable edge/fog computing framework. We sequentially establish two nonconvex programming problems and optimize delay and energy performance during AR data acquisition and AR content downloading, respectively. Two convex approximation skills are applied to transform the original problems into tractable form.

Still, mobile AR lags behind its desktop counterpart in both latency and performance. Simple offloading to external computers has been attempted, but is not practical due to high communication latency and adverse user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel Mobile Edge Computing framework for Augmented Reality applications (MEC-AR). MEC-AR is designed to take advantage of 5G cellular networks and make optimized computation-offloading decisions in a multi-tiered hierarchy. A three-layered architecture involving the end user, the mobile edge, and finally the cloud is envisioned. In the context of MEC resource management, we cast a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that aims at finding an efficient application placement on the MEC-AR layers to minimize the network latency. We evaluate the performance of our proposed MEC-AR framework by conducting extensive experimental analysis using images taken around Rutgers University. Simulation results coupled with real-time experiments on a small-scale MEC testbed show that our hierarchical computation mechanism improves the performance of mobile AR applications in terms of both energy consumption and network latency.","2020 17th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)",2020.0,10.1109/secon48991.2020.9158429,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Collective activities like brainstorming and sensemaking often use space for arranging documents and information and thus will likely benefit from AR-enhanced offices. Until now, there has been very little research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization. We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage spaces specifically for collaboration.",CHI Extended Abstracts,2021.0,10.1145/3411763.3451588,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

The success of the edge computing networking paradigm depends on the proper orchestration of the edge servers. Several Edge applications and services are intolerant to latency, especially in 5G and beyond networks, such as intelligent video surveillance, E-health, Internet of Vehicles, and augmented reality applications. The edge devices underwent rapid growth in both capabilities and size to cope with the service demands. Orchestrating it on the cloud was a prominent trend during the past decade. However, the increasing number of edge devices poses a significant burden on the orchestration delay. In addition to the growth in edge devices, the high mobility of users renders traditional orchestration schemes impractical for contemporary edge networks. Proper segmentation of the edge space becomes necessary to adapt these schemes to address these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a segmentation technique employing lax clustering and segregated mobility-based clustering. We then apply latency mapping to these clusters. The proposed scheme’s main objective is to create subspaces (segments) that enable light and efficient edge orchestration by-reducing the processing time and the core cloud communication overhead. A bench-marking simulation is conducted with the results showing decreased mobility-related failures and reduced orchestration delay.","2021 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",2021.0,10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615795,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Task offloading is challenging in open and dynamic environments where applications with various Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements frequently produce a fluctuated workload at the edge of a network with heterogeneous, mobile, and geodistributed nodes.The current literature has addressed this challenge by offloading tasks to fog or Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers. However, in strictly delay-sensitive applications such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, or remote surgery, a Pure Edge Computing (PEC) paradigm that allows peer-to-peer communication and cooperation is more reasonable.This paper proposes a novel learning-based task offloading model that enables a pure edge-based system with mobile and resource-constrained nodes to accommodate fluctuating workload generated by applications with various SLAs and QoS.

Many edge applications, such as multi-player augmented reality (AR) gaming and federated machine learning, require that distributed clients work collaboratively for a common goal through message exchanges. Given an edge network, it is an open problem how to deploy such collaborative edge applications to achieve the best overall system performance. This paper presents a formal study of this problem. We first provide a mix of cost models to capture the system. Based on a thorough formulation, we propose an iterative algorithm dubbed ITEM, where in each iteration, we construct a graph to encode all the costs and convert the cost optimization problem into a graph cut problem. By obtaining the minimum $s-t$ cut via existing max-flow algorithms, we address the original problem via solving a series of graph cuts. We rigorously prove that ITEM has a parameterized constant approximation ratio. Inspired by the optimal stopping theory, we further design an online algorithm called OPTS, based on optimally alternating between partial and full placement updates. Our evaluations with real-world data traces demonstrate that ITEM performs close to the optimum (within 5%) and converges fast. OPTS achieves a bounded performance as expected while reducing full updates by more than 67% of the time.",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2021.0,10.1109/TNET.2020.3025985,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

But to keep continuity accuracy between digital object pieces, this study aims to modify the grid method to become a vertex marker. Vertex marker is produced by removing the edge and using the vertex to place the marker. Vertex markers inherit the advantages of the Grid method. Therefore, vertex markers can be used to reproduce large digital objects accurately and can be reached by hand when displayed.

In recent years, edge computing has become a popular choice for latency-sensitive applications like facial recognition and augmented reality because it is closer to the end users compared to the cloud. However, the presence of multiple edge servers adversely affects the reliability due to difficulty in maintenance of heterogeneous servers. In this thesis, we first evaluate the performance of various server configuration models in edge computing using EdgeCloudSim, a popular simulator for edge computing. The performance is evaluated in terms of service time and percentage of failed tasks for an Augmented Reality application. We evaluated the performance of the following edge computing models, Exclusive: Mobile only, Edge only, Cloud only; and Hybrid: Edge & Cloud hybrid with load-balancing on the Edge, and Mobile & Edge hybrid. We analyzed the impact of variation of different parameters such as WAN bandwidth, cost of cloud resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, etc., on the performance of the edge computing mod- els. We show that due to variation in the above parameters, the exclusive models are not sufficient for computational requirements and there is a need for hybrid edge computing models. Next, we introduce a novel edge computing model called unmanaged edge computing and propose an orchestration scheme in this scenario. Although infrastructure providers are working toward creating managed edge networks, personal devices such as laptops, desktops, and tablets, which are widely available and are underutilized, can also be used as potential edge devices. We call such devices Unmanaged Edge Devices (UEDs). Scheduling application tasks on such an unmanaged edge system is not straightforward because of three fundamental reasons—heterogeneity in the computational capacity of the UEDs, uncertainty in the availability of the UEDs (due to the devices leaving the system), and interference among multiple tasks sharing a UED. In this work, we present I-BOT, an interference-based orchestration scheme for latency sensitive tasks on an Unmanaged Edge Platform (UEP). It minimizes the completion time of applications and is bandwidth efficient. I-BOT brings forth three innovations. First, it profiles and predicts the interference patterns of the tasks to make scheduling decisions. Second, it uses a feedback mechanism to adjust for changes in the computational capacity of the UEDs and a prediction mechanism to handle their sporadic exits, both of which are fundamental characteristics of a UEP. Third, it accounts for input dependence of tasks in its scheduling decision (such as, two tasks requiring the same input data). To demonstrate the effectiveness of I-BOT, we run real-world unit experiments on UEDs to collect data to drive our simulations. We then run end-to-end simulations with applications representing autonomous driv- ing, composed of multiple tasks. We compare to two basic baselines (random and round-robin) and two state-of-the-arts, Lavea [SEC-2017] and Petrel [MSN-2018] for scheduling these applications on varying-sized UEPs. Compared to these baselines, I-BOT significantly reduces the average service time of application tasks. This reduction is more pronounced in dynamic heterogeneous environments, which would be the case in a UEP.",ArXiv,2020.0,10.25394/PGS.12749306.V1,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Edge computing promises to exploit these underlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive applications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key missing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned, unmanaged devices into a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the heterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability of such devices. In this paper we propose an orchestration framework IBDASH , which orchestrates application tasks on an edge system that comprises a mix of commercial and personal edge devices. IBDASH targets reducing both end-to-end latency of execution and probability of failure for applications that have dependency among tasks, captured by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). IBDASH takes memory constraints of each edge device and network bandwidth into consideration. To assess the effectiveness of IBDASH , we run real application tasks on real edge devices with widely varying capabilities. We feed these measurements into a simulator that runs IBDASH at scale. Compared to three state-of-the-art edge orchestration schemes and two intuitive baselines, IBDASH reduces the end-to-end latency and probability of failure, by 14% and 41% on average respectively. The main takeaway from our work is that it is feasible to combine personal and commercial devices into a usable edge computing platform, one that delivers low and predictable latency and high availability.",,2022.0,,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

For EC, service function chaining is envisioned as a promising approach to configure various services in an agile, flexible, and cost-efficient manner. When running on top of geographically dispersed edge clouds, fully unleashing the benefits of service function chaining is, however, by no means trivial. In this paper, we propose an online orchestration framework for cross-edge service function chaining, which aims to maximize the holistic cost efficiency, via jointly optimizing the resource provisioning and traffic routing on-the-fly. This long-term cost minimization problem is difficult since it is NP-hard and involves future uncertain information. To simultaneously address these dual challenges, we carefully combine an online optimization technique with an approximate optimization method in a joint optimization framework, through: 1) decomposing the long-term problem into a series of one-shot fractional problem with a regularization technique and 2) rounding the fractional solution to a near-optimal integral solution with a randomized dependent scheme that preserves the solution feasibility.

Our proposed dynamic MAR conﬁguration adaptations can minimize the per frame energy consumption of multiple MAR clients without degrading their preferred MAR performance metrics, such as latency and de- tection accuracy.

Moreover, the data placement needs to be adapted over time to serve time-varying demands, while considering system stability and operation cost. We address this problem by proposing a two-time-scale framework that jointly optimizes service (data & code) placement and request scheduling, under storage, communication, computation, and budget constraints. We fully characterize the complexity of our problem by analyzing the hardness of various cases.

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network-periphery, in proximity to end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in MEC-enabled multi-cell networks with multidimensional (storage-computation-communication) constraints.

The performance of MAR would be significantly improved by offloading the computation tasks to servers deployed with the close proximity to the users. In this paper, we design an edge network orchestrator to enable fast and accurate object analytics at the network edge for MAR. The measurement-based analytical models are built to characterize the tradeoff between the service latency and analytics accuracy in edge-based MAR systems. As a key component of the edge network orchestrator, a server assignment and frame resolution selection algorithm named FACT is proposed to mitigate the latency-accuracy tradeoff. Through network simulations, we evaluate the performance of the FACT algorithm and show the insights on optimizing the performance of edge-based MAR systems.

Wait no More: Immediate Placement of Time-Critical SFCs with VNF Sharing,"The increasing demand on real-time and time-critical applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality, collision avoidance and industrial IoT, is fuelled by the low-latency promised by next-generation mobile networks (5G). Time-critical applications and services are real-time software whose failure could result in catastrophic consequences such as fatalities, damage to property, even financial losses. Edge computing is the main enabler of 5G ultra-low latency use cases. Edge resources are limited compared to the abundant cloud computing resources. As such, provisioning time-critical applications at the edge is more challenging and demanding. Even though virtual network function (VNF) sharing improves the utilization of the service providers’ resources, service requests -including time-critical ones- can still be rejected due to insufficient resources. This paper proposes IPTSV, an immediate placement scheme for time-critical services with VNF sharing. The proposed scheme prioritizes time-critical premium (Pr) services over best-effort (BE) services. In cases when no resources are available for Pr services, a preemption mechanism preempts resources for the Pr service, by deporting one or more deployed BE services. The experimental results show that IPTSV can reduce the Pr services rejection rate to $\sim 0\%$, while minimizing the disturbance that BE services might witness such as prolonged waiting and turnaround times.",2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft),2022.0,10.1109/NetSoft54395.2022.9844068,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

In this regard, the dynamic items should be refreshed to the newest versions timely, when cached at the network edge. The state-of-the-art content placement methods mostly target on static items, and cache the popular items with priority to maximize the local hit rate. However, popular content items may have higher dynamics and require frequent cache refresh, which consumes more transmissions and degrades the system efficiency. In this work, we revisit the content placement problem at mobile edge, where the content dynamics and popularity are jointly considered when choosing items to cache. To this end, the effective hit rate of an cached content item is derived with respect to the corresponding request rate (i.e., popularity) and version update rate (i.e., dynamics). Specifically, the effective hit rate is proved to increase with the request arrival rate in an convex manner and decrease with the version update rate. Then, the popularity- and-lifetime-aware placement (PALAP) scheme is proposed to maximize the overall effective hit rate of the local cache when providing dynamic content services. Extensive simulations are conducted on OMNeT++ platform to validate the obtained analytical results. In addition, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can double the cache hit rate compared with the conventional most-popular-first placement (MPFP) scheme, if the content requests are less concentrated. Accordingly, the average service delay can be reduced effectively, especially when the system is heavily loaded.",2020 32nd International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 32),2020.0,10.1109/ITC3249928.2020.00025,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

We envision a rapid increase in the number of such applications for “edge” networks in the near future with virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), networked gaming, wearable cognitive assistance, autonomous driving and IoT analytics having already been proposed for edge- clouds instead of the central clouds to improve performance. This raises new challenges as the complexity of the resource allocation problem for multiple services with latency deadlines (i.e., which service to place at which node of the edge-cloud in order to satisfy the latency constraints) becomes significant. In this paper, we propose a set of practical, uncoordinated strategies for service placement in edge-clouds.

In particular, network slicing allows network operators (NOs) to divide the available network resources into multiple logical network slices (NSs) for providing dedicated virtual networks tailored to the specific service/business requirements. MEC enables NOs to provide diverse ultra-low latency services for supporting the needs of different industry verticals by moving computing facilities to the network edge. An NS can be constructed/deployed by instantiating a set of virtual network functions (VNFs) on top of MEC cloud servers for provisioning diverse latency-sensitive/time-critical communication services (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality) on demand at a lesser cost and time. However, VNFs, MEC cloud servers, and communication links are subject to failures due to software bugs, misconfiguration, overloading, hardware faults, cyber attacks, power outage, and natural/man-made disaster. Failure of a critical network component disrupts services abruptly and leads to users’ dissatisfaction, which may result in revenue loss for the NOs. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-connectivity in 5G networks to tackle this problem and our proposed approach is resilient against i) failure of VNFs, ii) failure of local servers within MEC, iii) failure of communication links, and iv) failure of an entire MEC cloud facility in regional level. To this end, we formulate the problem as a binary integer programming (BIP) model in order to optimally deploy NSs with the minimum cost, and prove it is NP-hard. Since the exact optimal solution for the NP-hard problem cannot be efficiently computed in polynomial time, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm based heuristic to obtain near-optimal solution in polynomial time. By extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach not only reduces resource wastage, but also improves throughput while providing high resiliency against failures.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2021.0,10.1109/TNSM.2021.3091053,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Prior research significantly focused on offloading tasks from terminals to edge servers, yet most ignored how to store task's necessary data (such as databases and pretrained machine‐learning models) on edge servers. Today, as data‐intensive tasks such as deep learning and augmented reality become common, large data storage and powerful computation resources are needed. This is a cumbersome challenge, because many lightweight edge servers have limited resources. If an edge server does not have a task's necessary data, then it needs to offload the task to cloud datacenters or download the necessary data from the cloud. Either case could increase data processing latency. To address this problem, this paper proposes an edge‐side collaborative storage framework called Edge‐side Cooperative Storage (ECS). In ECS, edge servers collaboratively store and process data‐intensive tasks's necessary data. Here, we particularly focus on how to effectively place data on ECS, using an approach that differs from existing works (that model data placement problems as linear/integer programming problems). Our work models cooperative storage as a graph and solves the data placement problem by using a graph‐based iterative algorithm. This algorithm easily extends to a distributed version, so distributed ECSworks efficiently without a centralized scheduler. We also evaluate ECS's effectiveness and convergence through simulations. Simulation results show that ECSis 2× better than a traditional nonshared storage framework in terms of the cache hit rate.",Concurr. Comput. Pract.

Common orchestration solutions make placement decisions based only on the resources of the underlying network and the application resource requests; however, using the profiles of applications to make placement decisions has the potential to enhance the final performance perceived by the end-users. This paper proposes the use of application profiles according to their popularity to guide their placement. To corroborate the effectiveness of the use of the profiles, two placement mechanisms are presented, one based on Genetic Algorithm and the other inspired on graph partitions.

Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time. This transformation calls for novel technologies like multi-access edge computing (MEC) to satisfy the stringent latency and bitrate requirements of the mentioned applications. The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users’ mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, SFC placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The objective functions of this MILP-based problem formulation are to minimize (i) the service provisioning cost, (ii) the transport network utilization, and (iii) the service interruption.

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network edge, in proximity to the end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be pre-stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in dense MEC networks with multidimensional constraints. We show that this problem generalizes several well-known placement and routing problems and propose an algorithm that achieves close-to-optimal performance using a randomized rounding technique.

Thus, the system can reduce unnecessary waste of resources. In addition, we use multi-access edge computing (MEC) to provide computing resources.

Provisioning reliable network services for users is the top priority of most network service providers, as unreliable services or severe service failures can result in tremendous losses of users, particularly for their mission-critical applications. In this paper, we study reliability-aware VNF instances provisioning in an MEC, where different users request different network services with different reliability requirements through paying their requested services with the aim to maximize the network throughput. To this end, we first formulate a novel reliability-aware VNF instance placement problem by provisioning primary and secondary VNF instances at different cloudlets in MEC for each user while meeting the specified reliability requirement of the user request. We then show that the problem is NP-hard and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we instead devise an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio for the problem. Moreover, we also consider two special cases of the problem. For one special case where each request only requests one primary and one secondary VNF instances, the problem is still NP-hard, and we devise a constant approximation algorithm for it. For another special case where different VNFs have the same amounts of computing resource demands, we show that it is polynomial-time solvable by developing a dynamic programming solution for it.

With multiple possible computation centers, the “where” and when” of solving these requests becomes paramount when meeting user deadlines. We formulate the problem of meeting users’ deadlines while minimizing the total cost to the edge-to-cloud service provider as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem.

This technology not only minimizes the end-to-end latency but also increases the efficiency of computing. Some latency-sensitive applications, such as cloud video, online game, and augmented reality, take advantage of the MEC system to provide fast and stable services. Several new network techniques, including the implementation of NFV (Network Function Virtualization), the placement of VNF (Virtual Network Function) and the scheduling of SFC (Service Function Chain), should be considered to be applied in the MEC system. In this paper, we focus on the research about the scheduling of SFC in the NFV enabled MEC system and propose a solution accordingly. First, we make reasonable assumptions on the settings of MEC systems and model the SFC scheduling problem into a flexible job-shop scheduling problem. Since minimizing the latency can significantly improve the quality of service (QoS) and increase the revenue of Internet Service Providers, our optimization goal is to minimize the overall scheduling latency. To solve this optimization problem, a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm DQS is proposed. DQS can detect the variation of the MEC system’s environment and perform adaptive scheduling for SFC requests. As the results of the simulation indicate, DQS works better than the other off-the-shelf algorithms in two key indexes: overall scheduling latency and average resource usage. Moreover, DQS can shorten the decision time and schedule SFCs stably with high performance.

Applications which require low latency response such as video surveillance, augmented reality and autonomous vehicles demand a swift and efficient analysis of this data. Existing approaches employ cloud infrastructure to store and perform machine learning-based analytics on this data. This centralized approach has limited ability to support real-time analysis of large-scale streaming data due to network bandwidth and latency constraints between data source and cloud. We propose RealEdgeStream (RES) an edge enhanced stream analytics system for large-scale, high performance data analytics. The proposed approach investigates the problem of video stream analytics by proposing (i) filtration and (ii) identification phases. The filtration phase reduces the amount of data by filtering low-value stream objects using configurable rules. The identification phase uses deep learning inference to perform analytics on the streams of interest. The phases consist of stages which are mapped onto available in-transit and cloud resources using a placement algorithm to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints identified by a user.

Many solutions have proposed to deploy virtual resources as close as possible to the consumers using virtual machines and containers. However, the most popular container orchestration tools, e.g., Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, do not take into account the locality aspect during deployment, resulting in poor location choices at the edge of the network. In this paper, we propose an edge deployment strategy to tackle the lack of locality awareness of the container orchestrator. In this strategy, the orchestrator collects information about latency and the real-time resource consumption from the current container deployments, providing a bird's-eye view of the most demanded locations and the best places for deployment to cover the largest number of clients. We evaluated the proposed model using 16 AWS regions across the globe and compared to the standard deployment strategies. The experimental results show our edge strategy reduces the average latency between serving container to the clients by up to 4 times compared to the standard deployment algorithms.",Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Middleware for Edge Clouds & Cloudlets  - MECC '19,2019.0,10.1145/3366614.3368101,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Most existing research has focused on effectively improving the use of computing resources for computation offloading while neglecting non-trivial amounts of data, which need to be pre-stored to enable service execution (e.g., virtual/augmented reality, video analytics, etc.). In this paper, we, therefore, investigate service provisioning in MEC consisting of two sub-problems: (i) service placement determining services to be placed in each MEC node under its storage capacity constraint, and (ii) request scheduling determining where to schedule each request considering network delay and computation limitation of each MEC node. The main objective is proposed to ensure the quality of experience (QoE) of users, which is also yet to be studied extensively. A utility function modeling user perception of service latency is used to evaluate QoE. We formulate the problem of service provisioning in MEC as an Integer Nonlinear Programming (INLP), aiming at maximizing the total utility of all users. We then propose a Nested-Genetic Algorithm (Nested-GA) consisting of two genetic algorithms, each of whom solves a sub-problem regarding service placement or request scheduling decisions. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms conventional methods in terms of the total utility and achieves close-to-optimal solutions.",Applied Sciences,2019.0,10.3390/app9183776,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

While Cloud Computing carries out processing in large centralized data centers, Edge Computing leverages smaller-scale resources— often termed cloudlets—in the vicinity of users. Edge Computing is expected to support novel applications (e.g., mobile augmented reality) and the growing number of connected devices (e.g., from the domain of the Internet of Things). Today, however, we lack essential building blocks for the widespread public availability of Edge Computing, especially in urban environments. This thesis makes several contributions to the understanding, planning, deployment, and operation of Urban Edge Computing infrastructures. We start from a broad perspective by conducting a thorough analysis of the field of Edge Computing, systematizing use cases, discussing potential benefits, and analyzing the potential of Edge Computing for different types of applications. 
We propose re-using existing physical infrastructures (cellular base stations, WiFi routers, and augmented street lamps) in an urban environment to provide computing resources by upgrading those infrastructures with cloudlets. On the basis of a real-world dataset containing the location of those infrastructures and mobility traces of two mobile applications, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study of urban cloudlet coverage with four different metrics for coverage. After having shown the viability of using those existing infrastructures in an urban environment, we make an algorithmic contribution to the problem of which locations to upgrade with cloudlets, given the heterogeneous nature (with regards to communication range, computing resources, and costs) of the underlying infrastructure. Our proposed solution operates locally on grid cells and is able to adapt to the desired tradeoff between the quality of service and costs for the deployment. Using a simulation experiment on the same mobility traces, we show the effectiveness of our strategy. 
Existing mechanisms for computation offloading typically achieve loose coupling between the client device and the computing resources by requiring prior transfers of heavyweight execution environments. In light of this deficiency, we propose the concept of store-based microservice onloading, embedded in a flexible runtime environment for Edge Computing. Our runtime environment operates on a microservice-level granularity and those services are made available in a repository—the microservice store—and, upon request from a client, transferred from the store to execution agents at the edge. Furthermore, our Edge Computing runtime is able to share running instances with multiple users and supports the seamless definition and execution of service chains through distributed message queues. Empirical measurements of the implemented approach showed up to 13 times reduction in the end-to-end latency and energy savings of up to 94 % for the mobile device. 
We provide three contributions regarding strategies and adaptations of an Edge Computing system at runtime. Existing strategies for the placement of data and computation components are not adapted to the requirements of a heterogeneous (e.g., with regards to varying resources) edge environment. The placement of functional parts of an application is a core component of runtime decisions. This problem is computationally hard and has been insufficiently explored for service chains whose topologies are typical for Edge Computing environments (e.g., with regards to the location of data sources and sinks). To this end, we present two classes of heuristics that make the problem more tractable. We implement representatives for each class and show how they substantially reduce the time it takes to find a solution to the placement problem, while introducing only a small optimality gap. The placement of data (e.g., such captured by mobile devices) in Edge Computing should take into account the user’s context and the possible intent of sharing this data. Especially in the case of overloaded networks, e.g., during large-scale events, edge infrastructure can be beneficial for data storage and local dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose vStore, a middleware that—based on a set of rules—decouples applications from pre-defined storage locations in the cloud. We report on results from a field study with a demonstration application, showing that we were able to reduce cloud storage in favor of proximate micro-storage at the edge. 
As a final contribution, we explore the adaptation possibilities of microservices themselves. We suggest to make microservices adaptable in three dimensions: (i) in the algorithms they use to perform a certain task, (ii) in their parameters, and (iii) in auxiliary data that is required. These adaptations can be leveraged to trade a faster execution time for a decreased quality of the computation (e.g., by producing more inaccurate or partly wrong results). We argue that this is an important building block to be included in an Edge Computing system in view of both constrained resources and strict requirements on computation latencies. We conceptualize an adaptable microservice execution framework and define the problem of choosing the service variant, building upon the design of our previously introduced Edge Computing runtime environment. For a case study, we implement representative examples (e.g., in the field of computer vision and image processing) and outline the practical influence of the abovementioned tradeoff. 
In conclusion, this dissertation systematically analyzes the field of Urban Edge Computing, thereby contributing to its general understanding. Our contributions provide several important building blocks for the realization of a public Edge Computing infrastructure in an urban environment.",,2020.0,10.25534/TUPRINTS-00013362,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Time-sensitive applications (e.g., augmented reality, gaming, real-time video analysis) have tight constraints that must be met. With multiple possible computation centers, the ""where"" and ""when"" of solving these requests becomes paramount when meeting their deadlines. We formulate the problem of meeting users' deadlines while minimizing the total cost of the edge-to-cloud service provider as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. We show the NP-hardness of this problem, and propose two heuristics based on making decisions on a local vs global scale. We vary the number of users, the QoS constraint, and the cost difference between remote cloud and cloudlets(edge clouds), and run multiple Monte-Carlo runs for each case.

Mobile edge computing in ultra-dense network is expected as an effective solution for meeting the low latency demand. However, the distributed computing resource in edge cloud and energy dynamics in the battery of mobile device makes it challenging to offload tasks for users. In this paper, leveraging the idea of software defined network, we investigate the task offloading problem in ultra-dense network aiming to minimize the delay while saving the battery life of user’s equipment. Specifically, we formulate the task offloading problem as a mixed integer non-linear program which is NP-hard. In order to solve it, we transform this optimization problem into two sub-problems, i.e., task placement sub-problem and resource allocation sub-problem. Based on the solution of the two sub-problems, we propose an efficient offloading scheme.

The inherent long-distance propagation and possible network congestion of mobile cloud computing may lead to excessive latency, which cannot satisfy the new delay-sensitive mobile applications. The proximity of edge computing provides the possibility of low-latency access and raises increasing interest from non-mobile operators; therefore, edge computing faces a variety of access network technologies, including wired (fixed) and wireless (mobile) access. In this paper, we propose an integrated heterogeneous networking scheme for multi-access edge computing and fiber-wireless access networks that uses network virtualization to achieve the dynamic orchestration of the network, storage, and computing resources to meet diverse application demands. The global view and centralized control of the entire network and the unified scheduling of the resources in the scheme anticipate the convergence of various types of access networks and the edge cloud. The multipath transmission of the service flows is further combined as an instance of integrated edge cloud networking. An experimental testbed is established in the laboratory, and the performance of the multi-access edge computing and networking is evaluated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.

In this paper, we investigate the joint optimal placement of virtual service chains consisting of virtual application functions (components) and the steering of traffic through them, over a 5G multi-technology edge network model consisting of both Ethernet and mmWave links. This problem is NP-hard. We provide a comprehensive “microscopic” binary integer program to model the system, along with a heuristic that is one order of magnitude faster than solving the corresponding binary integer program. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of managing virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity. We observe significant gains when deploying mmWave links that complement the Ethernet physical infrastructure. Moreover, most of the gains are attributed to only 30% of these mmWave links.",2018 4th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization and Workshops (NetSoft),2018.0,10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460097,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

To make EC pervasive, the following challenges must be tackled: how to satisfy the growing demand for edge computing facilities, how to discover the nearby edge servers, and how to securely access them? In this paper, we present ExEC, an open framework where edge providers can offer their capacity and be discovered by application providers and end-users. ExEC aims at the unification of interaction between edge and cloud providers so that cloud providers can utilize services of third-party edge providers, and any willing entity can easily become an edge provider. In ExEC, the unfolding of initially cloud-deployed application towards edge happens without administrative intervention, since ExEC discovers available edge providers on the fly and monitors incoming end-user traffic, determining the near-optimal placement of edge services. ExEC is a set of loosely coupled components and common practices, allowing for custom implementations needed to embrace the diverse needs of specific EC scenarios.

To address this, mobile edge-cloud (MEC) has been proposed as an approach to bring resources closer to users. Recently, in contrast to conventional fixed cloud locations, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has, with some added cost due to the necessary decentralization, enhanced MEC with new flexibility in placing MEC services to any nodes capable of virtualizing their resources. In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes. We first show that the placement optimization problem is NP-hard and propose an online dynamic resource allocation scheme that consists of an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm and a detection mechanism to identify the time when the system will no longer be able to satisfy the applications' delay requirement. Our scheme takes into account the effect of current existing techniques (i.e., auto-scaling and load balancing).

Proposed applications include high-definition, low-latency video streaming, remote surgery, as well as applications for tactile Internet, virtual or augmented reality that demand network side data processing (such as image recognition, transformation or head/eye motion aware rendering). One approach to support these use cases is to introduce virtualized network services at the edge of the network, in close proximity of the end users to reduce end-to-end latency, time-to-response and unnecessary utilization of the core network, while providing flexibility for resource allocation. While many research projects including our previous work on Glasgow Network Functions have proposed running virtual network functions (vNF)s at the network edge, a latency-optimal placement allocation has not been presented before for the network edge and therefore the impact on user-to-vNF latency has not been investigated.In this paper, we formulate a simple vNF placement problem that minimizes end-to-end latency from users to their network functions.

However, MEO needs to scale its capacity concerning a large number of devices to avoid task failure and to reduce service time. To cope with this issue, we propose MEO with fuzzy-based logic that splits tasks from mobile devices and maps them onto the cloud and edge servers to reduce the latency of handling these tasks and task failures. A fuzzy-based MEO handles the multi-criteria decision-making process to decide where the offloaded task should run by considering multiple parameters in the same framework. Our approach selects the appropriate host for task execution and finds the optimal task-splitting strategy.

Existing research works have paid lots of attention to how to offload computation tasks from terminals to edge servers, but most of them ignored how to store tasks' necessary data like pretrained models or databases on edge servers. Recently, the data-intensive tasks like deep learning and augmented reality are becoming common, which need large data storages and powerful computation resources. This leads to a cumbersome challenge, since many lightweight edge servers have limited resources. If an edge server does not have a task's necessary data, it needs to offload the task to cloud data centers or download the necessary data from the cloud. Both cases could increase the data processing latency. To address this problem, this paper proposes an edge-side collaborative storage framework (ECS). In ECS, the edge servers collaboratively store and process data-intensive tasks' necessary data. Particularly, if an edge server does not have the necessary data, it will forward the task to the nearest servers that contain the data. An effective iterative data placement algorithm is also proposed to improve ECS's performance. The experimental results show that ECS is 2 x better than the traditional non-shared storage framework in terms of the cache hit rate.",2018 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design ((CSCWD)),2018.0,10.1109/CSCWD.2018.8465306,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Currently, by matching the characteristics of incoming Internet of Things (IoT) applications to the current state of computing and networking resources, a mobile edge orchestrator (MEO) provides high-quality service while temporally and spatially changing the incoming workload. Moreover, a fuzzy-based MEO is used to handle the multicriteria decision-making process by considering multiple parameters within the same framework in order to make an offloading decision for an incoming task of an IoT application. In a fuzzy-based MEO, the fuzzy-based offloading strategy leads to unbalanced loads among edge servers. Therefore, the fuzzy-based MEO needs to scale its capacity when it comes to a large number of devices in order to avoid task failures and to reduce service times. In this paper, we investigate and propose an online workload balancing algorithm, which we call the fuzzy-based (FuB) algorithm, for a fuzzy-based MEO. By considering user configuration requirements, server geographic locations, and available resource capacities for achieving an online algorithm, our proposal allocates the proximate server for each incoming task in real time at the MEO. A simulation was conducted in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications. Compared to two benchmark schemes that use the fuzzy logic approach for an MEO in IoT environments, the simulation results (using EdgeCloudSim) show that our proposal outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of service time, the number of failed tasks, and processing times when the system is overloaded.",Wirel.

However, due to the mobility of the end-users and the dynamic edge environment, it becomes challenging to handle the task ofﬂoading with high performance. Moreover, since each application in mobile devices has different characteristics, a task orchestrator must be adaptive and have the ability to learn the dynamics of the environment. For this purpose, we develop a deep reinforcement learning based task orchestrator, DeepEdge, which learns to meet different task requirements without needing human interaction even under the heavily-loaded stochastic network conditions in terms of mobile users and applications. Given the dynamic ofﬂoading requests and time-varying communication conditions, we successfully model the problem as a Markov process and then apply the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to implement DeepEdge. To evaluate the robustness of DeepEdge, we experiment with four different applications including image rendering, infotainment, pervasive health, and augmented reality in the network under various loads. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our agent with the four different task ofﬂoading approaches in the literature.

Interactive immersive applications are an example of those enabled services. Such applications allow for the interaction between multiple users in a 3D environment created by virtual presentations of real objects and participants using various technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Extended Reality (XR), Digital Twin (DT) and holography. These applications require advanced computing models which allow for the processing of massive gathered amounts of data. Motions, gestures and object modification should be captured, added to the virtual environment, and shared with all the participants. Relying only on the cloud to process this data can cause significant delays. Therefore, a hybrid cloud/edge architecturewith an intelligent resource orchestration mechanism, that is able to allocate the available capacities efficiently is necessary. In this paper, a blockchain and federated learning-enabled predicted edge-resource allocation (FLP-RA) algorithm is introduced to manage the allocation of computing resources in B5G networks.

To evaluate an augmented reality (AR) system in combination with a 1.5-T closed-bore magnetic resonance (MR) imager as a navigation tool for needle biopsies.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The experimental protocol had institutional animal care and use committee approval. Seventy biopsies were performed in phantoms by using 20 tube targets, each with a diameter of 6 mm, and 50 virtual targets. The position of the needle tip in AR and MR space was compared in multiple imaging planes, and virtual and real needle tip localization errors were calculated. Ten AR-guided biopsies were performed in three pigs, and the duration of each procedure was determined. After successful puncture, the distance to the target was measured on MR images. The confidence limits for the achieved in-plane hit rate and for lateral deviation were calculated. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine whether the placement error in a particular dimension (x, y, or z) differed from the others.


RESULTS
For the 50 virtual targets, a mean error of 1.1 mm +/- 0.5 (standard deviation) was calculated. A repeated measures analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant difference (P > .99) in the errors in any particular orientation. For the real targets, all punctures were inside the 6-mm-diameter tube in the transverse plane. The needle depth was within the target plane in 11 biopsy procedures; the mean distance to the center of the target was 2.55 mm (95% confidence interval: 1.77 mm, 3.34 mm). For nine biopsy procedures, the needle tip was outside the target plane, with a mean distance to the edge of the target plane of 1.5 mm (range, 0.07-3.46 mm). In the animal experiments, the puncture was successful in all 10 cases, with a mean target-needle distance of 9.6 mm +/- 4.85. The average procedure time was 18 minutes per puncture.


CONCLUSION
Biopsy procedures performed with a combination of a closed-bore MR system and an AR system are feasible and accurate.",Radiology,2006.0,10.1148/RADIOL.2382041441,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Since many such mobile applications are computation-intensive, mobile edge computing (MEC), a promising computing paradigm that can provide on-demand computation resources (i.e., virtual machines (VMs)), is considered to adopt for allowing MUs to offload their computation tasks to EgSvrs in the proximity. Previous works have developed many schemes to schedule computation tasks to be offloaded to edge servers (EgSvrs). However, these developed schemes are centralized, which are vulnerable to congested coordination operations, and have no trustworthiness guarantee as well. In this paper, we propose to design a decentralized coordination scheme to orchestrate MUs and EgSvrs for scheduling computation tasks to their right VMs by taking advantage of blockchain technology. Specifically, we develop an efficient task-VM matching algorithm that jointly considers task execution time and energy consumption. Particularly, we prove the stability of the task-VM matching achieved by the developed matching algorithm. Besides, we further implement the developed task-VM matching algorithm on the blockchain by developing a smart matching contract to perform task-VM matching on the blockchain without trusted third parties. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our decentralized coordination scheme can improve the performance significantly and converge to a stable state very quickly.",IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,2021.0,10.1109/tnse.2020.3001081,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Such new standards must be capable of serving large number of devices, especially mobile and wearable devices, with the best quality-of-experience (QoE) possible including highly crowded areas. The 5G standard, which is not just an extension to 4G, has emerged as a viable solution to fulfill the aforementioned needs. In this context, 5G promises a paradigm shift, in telecommunication systems and services, by focusing not only on providing high-speed connections with higher data rates, but also in serving large number of devices/users while maintaining high QoE. 5G is regarded as capable of satisfying the resource requirements for the emerging mobile applications such as virtual and augmented reality, vehicular networks (VANETs), and the internet-of-things (IoT) applications. 5G will support emerging communications including machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with low cost, low latency, high bandwidth, and energy efficiency. The deployment of 5G-based systems, which is expected to be available by 2020, will require the integration of multiple new technologies to achieve its goals. Such technologies include Mobile Edge Comping (MEC), wireless virtualization, and software defined systems or networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) among others. In addition, methodologies for resource manipulation and sensing as well as allocation for optimized performance so that QoE of the end-users is maximized. Due to the nonlinearity of the QoE model, the resource manipulation with solution provision within the context of SDN for MEC devices should be solved concurrently so that the associated performance can be assessed and evaluated. The inclusion of MEC, SDN, and NFV, and its possible support for 5G systems is emerging as one of the highly active research areas with a large room for improvements. One specific aspect of great importance is the continuously increasing processing, caching, and storage capabilities required by the emerging applications such as IoT and virtual reality. Considering the aforementioned needs, we arranged a special issue in European Transactions on Telecommunications (ETT). In response to the call for contribution of this special issue, we received 19 paper submissions. After a careful review process, 11 outstanding papers were selected for this special section. The first article is entitled “EdgePlace: Availability-aware Placement for Chained Mobile Edge Applications,” co-authored by Zhu, He and Huang, Changcheng. The authors proposed a novel model to track the availability and cost impact from placement policy changes of the mobile edge applications. The authors formulated their model as a stochastic programming problem. To minimize the complexity challenge, they also propose a heuristic algorithm called EdgePlace. The second article is entitled “A Collaborative Mobile Edge Computing and User Solution for Service Composition in 5G Systems,” co-authored by Al Ridhawi, Ismaeel; Aloqaily, Moayad; Kotb, Yehia; Al Ridhawi, Yousif; and Jararweh, Yaser. The authors envision a real-time context-aware service-composition collaborative framework that lies at the edge of the network, comprising MEC and user devices for fast composite service delivery. The proposed solution decomposes cloud data into a set of files and services, which are then replicated to MEC nodes. The third article is entitled “Sub-Carriers Assignment Scheme for Multiple Secondary Users in OFDMA Based IEEE 802.22 WRAN: A Game Theoretic Approach,” co-authored by Gupta, Nitin; Dhurandher, Sanjay; and Woungang, Isaac. The paper developed a suboptimal algorithm in which initially optimal number of subcarriers are found considering the equal power distribution. The problem is formulated as an oligopoly market competition and a noncooperative Cournot game is used in which different unlicensed secondary users (SUs) compete for the number of subcarriers based upon the data rate they are getting from current channel condition. The fair distribution of subcarriers is ensured by finding the Nash equilibrium.

We tackle the edge cloud network design problem for mobile access networks. The model is such that the virtual machines (VMs) are associated with mobile users and are allocated to cloudlets. Designing an edge cloud network implies first determining where to install cloudlet facilities among the available sites, then assigning sets of access points, such as base stations to cloudlets, while supporting VM orchestration and considering partial user mobility information, as well as the satisfaction of service-level agreements. We present link-path formulations supported by heuristics to compute solutions in reasonable time. We qualify the advantage in considering mobility for both users and VMs as up to 20% less users not satisfied in their SLA with a little increase of opened facilities. We compare two VM mobility modes, bulk and live migration, as a function of mobile cloud service requirements, determining that a high preference should be given to live migration, while bulk migrations seem to be a feasible alternative on delay-stringent tiny-disk services, such as augmented reality support, and only with further relaxation on network constraints.",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,2017.0,10.1109/TNET.2017.2652850,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

To this end, the integrated evolution of next-generation networks (e.g., 5G and beyond) and distributed cloud technologies (e.g., fog and mobile edge computing), have emerged as a promising paradigm to address the interaction- and resource-intensive nature of Metaverse applications. In this paper, we focus on the design of control policies for the joint orchestration of compute, caching, and communication (3C) resources in next-generation distributed cloud networks for the efﬁcient delivery of Metaverse applications that require the real-time aggregation, processing, and distribution of multiple live media streams and pre-stored digital assets. We describe Metaverse applications via directed acyclic graphs able to model the combination of real-time stream-processing and content distribution pipelines. We design the ﬁrst throughput-optimal control policy that coordinates joint decisions around (i) routing paths and processing locations for live data streams, together with (ii) cache selection and distribution paths for associated data objects. We then extend the proposed solution to include a max-throughput database placement policy and two efﬁcient replacement policies. In addition, we characterize the network stability regions for all studied scenarios.

Zhao, et al. Frontiers in robotics and AI; 2020; vol. 7; p. 35 Athens log in required* Motor skill learning of dental implantation surgery is difficult for novices because it involves fine manipulation of different dental tools to fulfill a strictly pre-defined procedure. Haptics-enabled virtual reality training systems provide a promising tool for surgical skill learning. In this paper, we introduce a haptic rendering algorithm for simulating diverse tool-tissue contact constraints during dental implantation. [...] To achieve the simulation of the complete implant procedures, the realistic simulation of the constrained movement of different implant tools and natural switching between the free motion on the surface and the constrained motion within the preparation bed are fundamental requirements. In this paper, we propose a state switching framework to seamless switch between the free motion state and the constrained motion state. Free motion on the surface can be simulated through the previous proposed virtual coupling method. And the virtual constraint method is built up to render the constrained motion, which shows efficiency in adapting to different kinds of constraint forms during the procedures of sliding, pulling, screwing, and perforating. 6 Making use of three-dimensional models of teeth, manufactured by stereolithographic technology, in practical teaching of endodontics P.

Tahani Journal of Medical Signals and Sensors; 2020; vol. 10 (no. 4); p. 239248 Athens log in required* In this research, a new package, including software and its prerequisite instruments, was proposed to help students in preclinical tooth preparation. For this purpose, images were taken from artificial teeth in different angles and directions before and after crown preparation and then were analyzed by the proposed methods to evaluate the quality and quantity of crown preparation. The proposed tooth image processing method had image registration, ROI segmentation, transformation to HSV color space, edge detection, morphology operation, and contour extraction abilities, which computed the amount and angle of crown preparation. Applying the proposed platform to a local tooth dataset showed a mean absolute error of 7.17 and a mean IOU of 0.89 in comparison to gold standard images segmented by the experts. Our method of evaluation seems totally a convenient aid to dental students to evaluate their work. However, before the application of this method as a part of dental education, the accuracy and validity of the outcomes should be tested against the faculty grading, a situation happening routinely in dental schools. 8 Exploring the Presence of Core Skills for Surgical Practice Through Simulation Ahmed Mohammed Balkhoyor, et al.

Numerous studies have shown the importance of low latency to the end user experience. Small response time increases on the order of a few hundred milliseconds directly translate to reduced user satisfaction and loss of revenue that persist even after a low latency environment is restored. One way to address this challenge in geo-distributed settings is to push all or part of the application, along with the data it requires, to the edge of the cloud closer to application clients. This thesis explores the idea of taking advantage of clients’ proximity to the edge of the network in order to reduce request latencies. SpearDB is a prototype replicated distributed database system which operates in a star network topology, with a core site and a large number of edge sites that are close to clients. Clients access the nearest edge, which holds replicas of locally relevant portions of the database. SpearDB’s edge sites coordinate through the core to provide a global transactional consistency guarantee (parallel snapshot isolation or PSI), while handling as much work locally as possible. SpearDB provides full general purpose transactional semantics with ACID guarantees. Experiments show that SpearDB is effective at reducing workload latencies for applications whose access patterns are geographically localizable. Many applications fit this criteria: bulletin boards (e.g., Craigslist, Kijiji), local commerce or services (e.g., Groupon, Uber), booking and ticketing (e.g., OpenTable, StubHub), location based services (mapping, directions, augmented reality), local news outlets and client-centric services (e-mail, rss feeds, gaming). SpearDB introduces protocols for executing application transactions in a geo-distributed setting under strong consistency guarantees. These protocols automatically hide the complexity as well as much of the latency introduced by geo-distribution from applications. The effectiveness of SpearDB depends on the placement of primary and secondary replicas at core and edge sites. The secondary replica placement problem is shown to be NP-hard. Several algorithms for automatic data partitioning and replication are presented to provide approximate solutions. These algorithms work in a geo-distributed core-edge setting under partial replication. Their goal is to bring data closer to clients in order to lower request latencies. Experimental comparisons of the resulting placements’ latency impact show good results. Surprisingly however, the placements produced by the simplest of the proposed algorithms are comparable in quality to those produced by more complex approaches.",,2017.0,,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

The future networks are shifting towards the cloudification of the network resources via Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This will equip ISPs with cutting-edge technologies to provide service customization during service delivery and offer QoE which meets customers’ needs via intelligent QoE control and management approaches. Towards this end, we provide in this paper a tutorial and a comprehensive survey of QoE management solutions in current and future networks. We start with a high-level description of QoE management for multimedia services, which integrates QoE modelling, monitoring, and optimization. This followed by a discussion of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) solutions as the dominant technique for streaming videos over the best-effort Internet. We then summarize the key elements in SDN/NFV along with an overview of ongoing research projects, standardization activities and use cases related to SDN, NFV, and other emerging applications. We provide a survey of the state-of-the-art of QoE management techniques categorized into three different groups: a) QoE-aware/driven strategies using SDN and/or NFV; b) QoE-aware/driven approaches for adaptive streaming over emerging architectures such as multi-access edge computing, cloud/fog computing, and information-centric networking; and c) extended QoE management approaches in new domains such as immersive augmented and virtual reality, mulsemedia and video gaming applications. Based on the review, we present a list of identified future QoE management challenges regarding emerging multimedia applications, network management and orchestration, network slicing and collaborative service management in softwarized networks. Finally, we provide a discussion on future research directions with a focus on emerging research areas in QoE management, such as QoE-oriented business models, QoE-based big data strategies, and scalability issues in QoE optimization.",IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,2019.0,10.1109/COMST.2019.2958784,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Tracking and monitoring non-sterile sources may provide the first step in estimating the state of sterility of surfaces. We extract the concept of monitoring sterility in surgery and implement it within a facility to monitor and diagnose potentially highly contagious patients, such as in the case of Covid-19. In particular, we use body tracking to monitor any patient movement within a designated space and simulate the flow of aerosols with an increased risk of contagious elements and surface contamination. We further deploy Augmented Reality to visualize any high-risk areas intuitively. The previous iteration of the system only rudimentary implemented surface contamination and lacked adaptivity to changes inside the scene. In this Master's Thesis, we investigate Scene-flow using Deep-Learning for monitoring the changes within the surface representation of the scene and enable monitoring of surfaces with increased risk of infection over a more extended period and scene movements. Abstract In surgical data science (SDS), Semantic Scene Graphs (SSGs) were proposed in earlier research to model surgical procedures and interventions. They logically visualize medical operation scenes, with nodes representing actors and objects, and the edges their relationship. Besides executing all analysis- heavy tasks (surgical phase- and tool recognition, human pose estimation) simultaneously, they also can dynamically adapt to scene changes. To validate SSGs, the 4D-operation room (OR) dataset was created, a 4D surgical SSG dataset that contains ten total knee replacement surgery simulations, annotated with SSG labels and graph- and human object poses. To support the dataset, this Abstract Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely employed for biometric measurement and diagnosis of internal organs due to its high availability and the fact it does not emit radiation. However, free-hand US examinations are often time-consuming and required years of training for a novice. To address this challenge, robotic techniques have been seen as a promising solution to provide accurate and repeatable US scans. To further enable automatically scanning for the internal organs covered by ribs, we registered the point clouds from a template CT to the 3D point clouds obtained from US sweep. The point clouds consist of the object's surface and the upper surface of the underlying bone. Afterward, an optimized trajectory can be computed using CT volume; and further, be transferred for robot execution. Abstract Commonly used sensors in computer vision send or receive light to measure the wavelength and energy within some specific spectrum. Additionally to this information, the relative oscillation of the electromagnetic wave defines its polarization. Emitted unpolarized natural light becomes polarized after being reflected from a surface. Hence it carries information about the object’s surface characteristics. In this Master Thesis project, we study the problem of how we can utilize such information in 6D object pose estimation. We first propose a baseline method, which encodes polarimetric and geometric information and learns the object pose in a data-driven supervised manner. Then we further utilize the invertible physical model to bring our pipeline into the realm of self-supervision. Thus, we introduce the first self-supervised 6D object pose prediction from polarimetric images. Abstract This project integrates a virtual respresentation of DLR's MIRO Surgery Robot. Our application combines the Head-Mounted-Display and AR visualization with the features of the MIRO robot to create GUI for multiple button options and explanations in a form of a tutorial. It also features a tracking technique to align the virtual robot with the real robot. Therefore we have created a communication protocol to send the configuration of the robot to the HMD and visualize the desired behavior. Abstract Although challenging, detecting and tracking catheters in fluoroscopic X-ray images is an essential task for interventional navigation during cardiac catheterization. Investigating catheter localization and tracking in a low dosage image setting is of even greater interest. Such a setting mitigates the risk of high radiation dosage exposure for both patient and physician. At the same time, catheter imaging is one of the ways to navigate the catheter to the operative field, which is essential for catheter placement. Wrong catheter guidance can result in lethal consequences. That is why the combination of catheter localization and tracking with low dosage images is a crucial problem. Recently, self-attention architectures have shown tremendous success in object detection and tracking for various computer vision tasks. However, the inclusion of temporal information into the framework of catheter tracking has not yet been investigated extensively. In this thesis, we create a self-attention-based neural network architecture for detecting and tracking catheter tips in sequences of fluoroscopic X-ray images. Abstract Surgical Operations, which take place in operating rooms of different sizes, require the use of various medical instruments. These medical instruments are numerous and are moved a lot during the operations performed by the medical staff. The 4D-OR dataset includes 10 mock surgeries, where 6 cameras were used to capture the operating room. In this project, the goal is to use the captured images or point clouds to analyse the presence of instruments in the scene using computer vision.

Abstract About 6.2% of the world’s adult population had type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2017, and an expected 7.3% will have type 2 diabetes in 2030 . This is not only associated with a lower quality of life for the patients due to the illness itself and its consequences but represents enormous health care costs and economic burden through lost productivity. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. This thesis will attempt to cluster single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a variety of adiposity-related phenotypes into genetic pathways and assess how these pathways affect the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, and other adiposity-related diseases. The analysis can be divided into five steps. In step one, a small number of well-established SNPs will be clustered based on their associations with 7 T2D-linked biomarkers from UK Biobank. In step two, data derived from abdominal MRI scans will be included in the clustering to determine whether these additional phenotypes refine the clusters found in step one. In step three, the causality structures of the clusters will be tested on two external datasets: MAGIC, a consortium of insulin-related traits, and GIANT, which focuses on anthropomorphic phenotype. Based on these results we will link our SNP clusters to known biological pathways in step four. Finally, in step five, we will validate and enhance our results using a larger initial list of BMI-related SNPs. Abstract Nodule segmentation is an essential step in the diagnosis and follow-up of thyroid pathologies. Automatic, deep learning based approaches for thyroid nodule segmentation can help the physicians to speed up the clinical workflow. In this project, a public dataset is used to train a deep learning network, which will be tested and fine tuned, if needed, on an in-house dataset. Abstract Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely employed for the diagnosis and staging of peripheral vascular diseases (PVD), mainly due to its high availability and the fact it does not emit radiation. Accurate, real-time segmentation of blood vessels in US images can aid in the measurement of lumen diameters and the assessment of vascular diseases. This, however, remains a challenging task, particularly for extremely small vessels that are difficult to visualize. To address this challenge, we are going to use the B-mode image and color Doppler image together to achieve robust and accurate segmentation results in real-time. The color Doppler images can provide a good estimation of vascular structures in the view of the current image. Besides, the spatial information of the arteries can be preserved from previous segmentation results using the optical flow technique. Afterward, the segmentation results are further used to guide the future movement of the robotic manipulator to accomplish the scan over limb arteries. Abstract There is an ever-increasing opportunity to explore auditory displays and sonification in medical interventions today. One of the most important motivations for conveying information through the auditory channel could be the shift of focus from in situ to external displays, and the overload of visual stimuli in augmented reality applications for surgeons. This project investigates various sonification methods that give users information about the proximity of navigation tools to targets. The developed approach is based on an interactive model-based sonification with four degrees of freedom. However, the aim is to make the sound as enjoyable and informative as possible.In the final step, a user study is conducted to compare the final candidate method with an existing baseline method.

In particular, setup costs of new systems in new environments are prohibitive for high-fidelity augmentation. The goal of this thesis is to take first steps towards an overall reduction in these costs. 
The main AR challenges that I focus on in this thesis are realistic lighting of virtual geometry, registration of polygons with the scene, tracking a user in a mobile context, creation of 3D annotations, and acquisition of the scene lighting environment. Each of these challenges is a fundamental component of many AR systems that commonly requires laborious setup in new environments. The contributions presented in this thesis directly address these challenges, lowering the startup costs. 
My first contribution is to enable more realistic lighting in AR applications by dynamically measuring the lighting environment to accurately shade virtual objects, and to use the video image to facilitate application of virtual light sources to dynamic physical geometry. Realistic lighting also depends on accurate registration of polygons with physical objects. My second contribution reduces the impact of registration errors for these polygons by shifting polygon edges to match image intensity edges. 
For mobile AR systems, high quality wide-area tracking is necessary. My third contribution is the GroundCam, which combines a camera pointed at the ground, used as an optical mouse, with a GPS unit for untethered, high quality position estimation. Good position estimates are needed to accurately create 3D annotations in the outdoor scene, which is what my fourth contribution focuses on. The aerial annotator system uses aerial photographs as a second viewpoint to enable easy annotation placement in outdoor scenes. Finally, my fifth contribution is Envisor, an application that allows users to quickly acquire environment maps of these scenes with just a head-worn or hand-held camera. 
To facilitate the work in this thesis, I developed two frameworks for conducting AR research. ARWin is an indoor desktop system that acts as a 3D application window manager, and is rapidly-deployable in new environments. Outdoor, mobile research is conducted within ARagorn, a wearable computing platform built with inexpensive, commonly-available hardware.",,2007.0,,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Typical assembly planners assume that parts have nominal shapes, while in reality their geometry varies according to the tolerance specifications. To account for toleranced parts, an assembly plan must be feasible for all possible variations of its components. Despite its practical importance, very few works address this problem. This paper presents a general framework for mechanical assembly planning with toleranced planar parts and shows how to incorporate it into existing planners. Our framework uses a general tolerancing model for parts: vertices are standard elementary functions of the part dimensions, which are allowed to vary within tolerance intervals. The relative position of parts is uniquely determined by an assembly graph, which defines constraints between features of neighboring parts. The assembly graph supports placements of parts with rotational degrees of freedom, cyclic relations, and conditional constraints, which occur in non-nominal contacts between edges. Using this framework, we show how to augment existing algorithms for useful motion types, including single and multiple step translations, and infinitesimal rigid motions. We demonstrate the dramatic reduction in the number of valid assembly plans when tolerances are introduced.",Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,2005.0,10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570748,semantic_scholar,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'
