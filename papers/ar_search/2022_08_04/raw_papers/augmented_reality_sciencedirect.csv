NFV provides the means to flexibly and dynamically manage and allocate resources, without being restricted to the hardware limitations of the network/cloud infrastructure. Resource orchestration for specific 5G vertical industries and use case families, such as Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), often introduce very strict requirements in terms of network performance. In such a dynamic environment, the challenge is to efficiently place directed graphs of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), named as SFCs (Service Function Chains), to the underlying network topology and to dynamically allocate the required resources. To this end, this work presents a novel framework, which makes use of a delay and location aware Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach, in order to perform optimized sequential SFC placement. Evaluation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of producing solutions that approximate well the global optimal, as well as achieving low execution time due to the employed GA-based approach and the incorporation of an early stopping criterion. The performance benefits of the proposed framework are evaluated in the context of an extensive set of simulation-based scenarios, under diverse network configurations and scales.",augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Emerging cloud platforms that tightly integrate compute and network resources enable novel services, such as versatile IoT (Internet of Things), augmented reality or Tactile Internet applications. Virtual infrastructure managers (VIMs), network controllers and upper-level orchestrators are in charge of managing these distributed resources. A key and challenging task of these orchestrators is to find the proper placement for software components of the services. As the basic variant of the related theoretical problem (Virtual Network Embedding) is known to be 
                        NP
                     -hard, heuristic solutions and approximations can be addressed. In this paper, we propose two architecture options together with proof-of-concept prototypes and corresponding embedding algorithms, which enable the provisioning of delay-sensitive IoT applications. On the one hand, we extend the VIM itself with network-awareness, typically not available in today's VIMs. On the other hand, we propose a multi-layer orchestration system where an orchestrator is added on top of VIMs and network controllers to integrate different resource domains. We argue that the large-scale performance and feasibility of the proposals can only be evaluated with complete prototypes, including all relevant components. Therefore, we implemented fully-fledged solutions and conducted large-scale experiments to reveal the scalability characteristics of both approaches. We found that our VIM extension can be a valid option for single-provider setups encompassing even 100 edge domains (Points of Presence equipped with multiple servers) and serving a few hundreds of customers. Whereas, our multi-layer orchestration system showed better scaling characteristics in a wider range of scenarios at the cost of a more complex control plane including additional entities and novel APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).",augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Through the construction of 5G user experience models for mobile augmented reality and tactile internet, the subjective expected experience of 5G users in mobile augmented reality applications is investigated. Based on the experimental results, the composition of mobile augmented reality, and the factors that affect 5G user, mobile 5G user experience model for augmented reality is as a design goal for mobile augmented reality. And research on mobile edge cloud computing powered by renewable energy. Based on the analysis of renewable energy, a 5G user computing task delay and power grid power consumption minimization model was established. It is decomposed into two sub-problems of computational resource allocation and task placement using alternating optimization. The sub-problems of computing tasks under renewable energy supply are obtained by solving the sub-problems. The experimental results show that the offload mode proposed in this paper is superior to the other two modes when the processing ratio before and after the task is less than 1, and the user contact frequency is greater than 0.0014. At the same time, it is obtained that the service node with higher mobility and larger computing power is allocated. The more workload, the more energy can be reduced in the network, thereby improving the performance of the system.",augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

This in turn burdens the process of deploying and updating hardware components and their corresponding software elements. Moreover, these devices are constantly generating data and sending them to central cloud platforms for advanced processing, with billions of devices are anticipated to be connected in the coming years, this will lead to impact the network performance. To alleviate this concern, a recent tendency is to process these data locally close to their sources at the network edge. However, edge devices are likely to be resource-constrained, which in some cases limits their abilities to perform processing tasks. This work falls within the efforts attempt to provide a solution to enable an effective management of resources at the edge devices, as well as, facilitating the deployment and update of heterogeneous software modules. The proposed solution relies on containers, a lightweight virtualization technology. It takes advantage of some containers concepts, especially the orchestration concept, to enable task forwarding and resource sharing between IoT gateway devices within the same cluster. Our experimentation has shown promising results and revealed the potential of existing virtualization platforms.",augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

NFV introduces volatility in the management of network functions, which can be dynamically orchestrated, i.e., placed, resized, etc. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can belong to VNF chains, where nodes in a chain can serve multiple demands coming from the network edges. In this paper, we formally define the VNF placement and routing (VNF-PR) problem, proposing a versatile linear programming formulation that is able to accommodate specific features and constraints of NFV infrastructures, and that is substantially different from existing virtual network embedding formulations in the state of the art. We also design a math-heuristic able to scale with multiple objectives and large instances. By extensive simulations, we draw conclusions on the trade-off achievable between classical traffic engineering (TE) and NFV infrastructure efficiency goals, evaluating both Internet access and Virtual Private Network (VPN) demands. We do also quantitatively compare the performance of our VNF-PR heuristic with the classical Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) approach proposed for NFV orchestration, showing the computational differences, and how our approach can provide a more stable and closer-to-optimum solution.",augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'
