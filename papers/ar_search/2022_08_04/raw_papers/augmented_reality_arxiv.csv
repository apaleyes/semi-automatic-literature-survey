networking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and
management of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this
paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for
microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered
compute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements
are known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the
application are not specified. As part of our solution, ROMA identifies and
leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for
various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to
appropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex,
multi-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application
requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications
in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains.
Through extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55%

allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is
proposed a Publish/-Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework
(PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources
between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules
IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally , the
framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled
backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users
and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation
Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT
data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub
architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework
components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of
an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating
resources efficiently keeping QoS awareness and handling restricted network
resources (bandwidth) for massive IoT traffic.",arxiv,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

  Films","Controlled growth, patterning and placement of carbon nanotube (CNT) thin
films for electronic applications are demonstrated. The density of CNT films is
controlled by optimizing the feed gas composition as well as the concentration
of growth catalyst in a chemical vapor deposition process. Densities of CNTs
ranging from 0.02 CNTs/{\mu}m^2 to 1.29 CNTs/{\mu}m^2 are obtained. The
resulting pristine CNT thin films are then successfully patterned using either
pre-growth or post-growth techniques. By developing a layered photoresist
process that is compatible with ferric nitrate catalyst, significant
improvements over popular pre-growth patterning methods are obtained.
Limitations of traditional post-growth patterning methods are circumvented by
selective transfer printing of CNTs with either thermoplastic or metallic
stamps. Resulting as-grown patterns of CNT thin films have edge roughness (< 1
{\mu}m) and resolution (< 5 {\mu}m) comparable to standard photolithography.
Bottom gate CNT thin film devices are fabricated with field-effect mobilities
up to 20 cm^2/Vs and on/off ratios of the order of 10^3. The patterning and
transfer printing methods discussed here have a potential to be generalized to
include other nanomaterials in new device configurations.",arxiv,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'
