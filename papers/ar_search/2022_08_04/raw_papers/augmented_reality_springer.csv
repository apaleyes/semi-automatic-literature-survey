In order to meet the latency requirements of new types of applications, service placement in edge computing becomes critical. The service placement strategy must be carried out in accordance with the relevant tasks within the program. However, previous research has paid little attention to related tasks within the application. If the service placement strategy does not consider task relevance, the system will frequently switch services and cause serious system overhead. In this paper, we mainly study the problem of service placement in edge computing. At the same time, we considered the issue of network access point selection during data transmission and the dependencies of task execution. We propose a Dynamic Service Placement List Scheduling (DSPLS) algorithm based on dynamic remaining task service time prediction. We conducted relevant simulation experiments, and our algorithm took the least amount of time to complete the task.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-022-04458-8,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is also succeeding from Cloud Computing due to its minimum latency constraints. In MEC, smart devices offload computation intensive tasks to the MEC server which achieves low latency. However, limitations exist for smart device battery lifetime and task execution delay because of an effective decision in the offloading scenario necessitating joint WPT and MEC offloading. The joint WPT and MEC offloading decisions are based on real time application requirements, placement of Base Station (BS) with power transfer capabilities for smart devices, and offloading opportunities in the MEC. To meet the energy consumption requirement, a BS integrated with MEC server and power transfer capability transfers wireless power to end devices as an incentive and offers opportunities for offloading. Transferring wireless power to end devices effectively meets the requirement of smart devices while extending battery lifetime. This article encapsulates the state of art work in methodologies of offloading in MEC and WPT to end nodes. We consider MEC offloading techniques with WPT and real time application requirements while summarizing related studies. We formulate a taxonomy of joint WPT and offloading in MEC. We compare the state-of-the-art studies based on parameters identified from taxonomy.

MEC represents a defining function of 5G, offering significant computational power at a reduced latency, allowing to augment the capabilities of user equipments while preserving their battery life. However, the demands generated by a plethora of innovative and concurrent IT services requiring high quality of service and quality of experience levels will likely overwhelm the—albeit considerable—resources available in 5G and Beyond scenarios. To take full advantage of its potential, MEC needs to be paired with innovative resource management solutions capable of effectively addressing the highly dynamic aspects of the scenario and of properly considering the heterogeneous and ever-changing nature of next generation IT services, prioritizing the assignment of resources in a highly dynamic and contextual fashion. This calls for the adoption of Artificial Intelligence based tools, implementing self-* approaches capable of learning the best resource management strategy to adapt to the ever changing conditions. In this paper, we present MECForge, a novel solution based on deep reinforcement learning that considers the maximization of total value-of-information delivered to end-user as a coherent and comprehensive resource management criterion. The experimental evaluation we conducted in a simulated but realistic environment shows how the Deep Q-Network based algorithm implemented by MECForge is capable of learning effective autonomous resource management policies that allocate service components to maximize the overall value delivered to the end-users.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10922-022-09672-6,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Companies can gain decisive competitive edges by automating their work processes and systems and networking them with each other and primary IT systems. A uniform communication standard such as OPC UA, a well-established global standard in the aforementioned manufacturing industries, is essential to a modular, scalable network of heterogeneous laboratory structures. Can the laboratory industry benefit from this standard and the years of development experience? In SPECTARIS, the German Industry Association for Optics, Photonics, Analytical and Medical Technologies, over 30 global market leaders, hidden champions and drivers of innovation in the laboratory industry put their heads together in the “Networked Laboratory Devices” working group and created the “Laboratory and Analytical Device Standard”, or LADS for short. Unlike numerous other attempts to establish communication standards for laboratories, LADS is based on the advanced OPC UA standard and takes an agnostic approach to cover the variety of devices, systems and requirements in laboratories. In this context, “agnostic” refers to the generic design and display of potentially as-yet-unknown aspects of the flow of information or communication structures. For the first time, LADS allows for modular, scalable networking of heterogeneous laboratory structures, efficient data transfers and – currently unused – user, process and device-based data analysis (keywords: big data, predictive analytics, data science) – even taking normative requirements into consideration.

In contrast, the computation-intensive tasks are offloaded to the cloud, and the data-intensive ones are offloaded to the edge. Though computation offloading over the cloud, edge, and terminals has been broadly studied, existing researches primarily establish scheduling algorithms on program high-level abstraction without consideration of challenges from program structures. We focus on task scheduling for offloading object-oriented applications while considering the ’encapsulation’ characteristic. We proposed a time-driven offloading strategy based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm employing the genetic algorithm operators with floating encoding (PGFE). This strategy introduces a genetic algorithm’s randomly two-point crossover and mutation operator to avoid converging on local optima effectively.

Since MEC servers have limited resources, an orchestrator utilizes a scheduling algorithm to decide where and when each task should execute so that the quality of service (QoS) of each task is achieved. The scheduling algorithm should use the least possible resources required to meet the service demands. In this paper, we develop a two-level cooperative scheduling algorithm with a centralized orchestrator layer. The first scheduling level is used to schedule tasks locally on MEC servers. In contrast, the second level resides at the orchestrator and assigns tasks to a neighboring base station or the cloud. The tasks serve in accordance with their priority, which is determined by the latency and required throughput. We also present a resource optimization algorithm for determining resource distribution in the system in order to ensure satisfactory service availability at the minimum cost. The resource optimization algorithm contains two variations that can be employed depending on the traffic model. One variant is used when the traffic is uniformly distributed, and the other is used when the traffic load is unbalanced among base stations. Numerical results show that the cooperative model of task scheduling outperforms the non-cooperative model. Furthermore, the results show that the suggested scheduling algorithm performs better than other well-known scheduling algorithms, such as shortest job first scheduling and earliest deadline first scheduling.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-022-01974-y,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard.

Heterogeneity, dynamism, and the growing number of computational devices in fog computing make reliability a challenge because failure is inevitable in such an environment. This work replicates an application on more than one fog node to ensure required reliability. But fog nodes may not offer the services free of cost. Therefore, to meet reliability requirement, IoT user has to pay more. Further, since fog owners may be autonomous, rational, and intelligent, they may hide the true cost of their fog resources. Therefore, the truthfulness of fog owners also becomes an important challenge. To address increased payment by IoT users and to ensure reliability and the truthfulness of fog owners, this work formulates the application placement problem considering the computational and reliability requirement of the IoT devices/users to minimize total payment. It is proved that the formulated problem is NP-hard.

The VNF is responsible for network services that run on virtual machines and can connect each of them alone or organize themselves into a single enclosure to use all the resources available in that enclosure. This flexibility allows physical and virtual resources to be used in a way that ensures control over power consumption, balance in resource use, and minimizing costs and latency. In order to consolidate VNF groups into a minimum number of virtual machine (VM) with estimation of the association relation to a measure of confidence under the context of possibility theory, we propose a new Fuzzy-FCA approach for VNF placement based on formal concept analysis (FCA) and fuzzy logic in mixed environment based on cloud data centers and Multiple access edge computing (MEC) architecture. Thus, the inclusion of this architecture in the cloud environment ensures the distribution of compute resources to the end user in order to reduce end-to-end latency. To confirm the effectiveness of our solution, we compared it to one of the best algorithms studied in the literature, namely the MultiSwarm algorithm. The results of the series of experiments carried out show the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm. Indeed, the harvested results confirm the capability of maximizing and balancing the use of resources, of minimizing the latency and the cost of energy consumption.

Aiming at increasing the VNF service satisfaction rates and minimizing the deployment cost, we use both transport and cloud-aware VNF scaling as well as multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms for VNF placement inside the cluster. The original joint scaling and placement problem is known to be NP-hard and hence the problem is solved by separating scaling and placement problems and solving them individually. The experiments are done using a dataset containing the information of a deployed digital-twin network service. These experiments show that considering transport and cloud parameters during scaling and placement algorithms perform more efficiently than the only cloud based or transport based scaling followed by placement algorithms. One of the MADM algorithms, Total Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), has shown to yield the lowest deployment cost and highest VNF request satisfaction rates compared to only transport or cloud scaling and other investigated MADM algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that considering both transport and cloud parameters in various availability scenarios of cloud and transport resources has significant potential to provide increased request satisfaction rates when VNF scaling and placement using the TOPSIS scheme is performed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10922-022-09645-9,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

It offers an effective solution to help mobile devices with computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks. However, the edge of network presents a dynamic environment with large number of devices, high mobility of users, heterogeneous applications and intermittent traffic. In such environment, edge computing often suffers from unbalance resource allocation, which leads to task failure and affects system performance. To tackle this problem, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning(DRL)-based workload scheduling approach with the goal of balancing the workload, reducing the service time and the failed task rate. Meanwhile, We adopt Deep-Q-Network(DQN) algorithms to solve the complexity and high dimension of workload scheduling problem. Simulation results show that our proposed approach achieves the best performance in aspects of service time, virtual machine(VM) utilization, and failed tasks rate compared with other approaches.

Accordingly, mobile edge computing (MEC) came into picture as novel emerging solutions to overcome many cloud computing issues. In this contemporary technology, the computation server and processing units are nearby edge servers to reduce latency, increase the network bandwidth and reduce energy consumption in user devices. These features can integrate with several domains such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence (AI), federated learning (FL) and fog computing, etc., to make the system more robust, elastic, efficient, and accurate. Regardless of the advantages, MEC faces several challenges, including security and privacy, deployment protocols, and offloading management. Although, various studies have been found tuning MEC to solve such challenges, the literature provide more ideas for smart developments toward applications particularly using FL and AI. Most researches miss combining interesting aspects of MEC, such as machine learning and deep learning approaches limiting works to only single aspect. Thus, a literature work is needed to focus on all the aspects of MEC together. This study aims to present a comprehensive survey on MEC by providing all necessary information, including network architecture, advantages, objectives, access technologies, deployment templates, characteristics, and many more. The work is not limited to only MEC background but also covers the AI and FL approaches used within MEC, allowing mobile phones to learn a shared predictive model collaboratively.

Nevertheless, these devices are considered constrained to processing such applications, due to the limitation of battery capacity and high-demand computation for these applications. Mobile cloud comping (MCC) is considered as an appropriate solution for addressing this problem and battery the battery lifetime of these devices, in which the intensive-computation tasks will be offloaded and processed at a conventional centralized cloud. However, cloud computing solution introduces a high communication delay which makes the computation offloading inappropriate for processing real-time applications. To tackle the problem of delay, a new emerging paradigm has been introduced, called mobile edge computing (MEC), in which the computation and storage capabilities of cloud computing have been provided at the edge of the network that enables such applications to be processed as well as satisfying the delay requirements. To this end, compared to other surveys, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on computation offloading on edge-cloud computing combination. In addition, we provide a novel taxonomy on computation offloading at edge-cloud computing combination and introduce the most and common recent computation offloading models regarding this taxonomy.

These kinds of applications are characterized by geographically distributed sensors that collect data to be processed through algorithms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Due to the vast amount of data to be processed by AI algorithms and the severe latency requirements of some applications, the emerging Edge Computing paradigm may represent the preferable choice for the supporting infrastructure. However, the design of edge computing infrastructures opens several new issues concerning the allocation of data flows coming from sensors over the edge nodes, and the choice of the number and the location of the edge nodes to be activated. The service placement issue can be modeled through a multi-objective optimization aiming at minimizing two aspects: the response time for data transmission and processing in the sensors-edge-cloud path; the (energy or monetary) cost related to the number of turned on edge nodes. Two heuristics, based on Variable Neighborhood Search and on Genetic Algorithms, are proposed and evaluated over a wide range of scenarios, considering a realistic smart city application with 100 sensors and up to 10 edge nodes. Both heuristics can return practical solutions for the given application. The results indicate a suitable topology for a network-bound scenario requires less enabled edge nodes comparatively with a CPU-bound scenario. In terms of performance gain, the VNS outperformed in almost every condition the GA approach, reaching a performance gain up to almost 40% when the network delay plays a significant role and when the load is higher. Hence, the experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed heuristics are useful to support the design of edge computing infrastructures for modern AI-based applications relying on data collected by geographically distributed IoT sensors.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80821-1_1,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Running such applications on mobile devices was challenging since mobile computing has inherent problems such as resource scarcity, frequent disconnections and mainly mobility. To address the shortcomings of mobile computing, researchers have used the concept of Cloud Computing (CC) to perform resource-intensive tasks outside mobile devices. This led to mobile and cloud computing convergence and the emergence of a new computing paradigm, the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), also called Mobile Cloud , which could effectively alleviate the problems of mobile computing. More sophisticated applications, such as online gaming, augmented reality, and virtual reality, which require broad bandwidth, low response latency and large computational power have emerged. In general, such a system relies on distant cloud services to perform all the data processing tasks, which result in explicit latency. The most promising solution for the requirements of aforesaid applications was the placement of content, compute, and cloud resources on the edge of the network, closer to concentrations of users. Consequently, Edge Computing (EC), which utilizes the proximal computational and networking resources, has arisen. The concept of Edge Computing was introduced, initially in the form of Cloudlets that assist mobile devices to gain computational and storage performance benefits, which later paved the way towards the concepts of Fog computing and Mobile Edge Computing, which essentially has to be referred as Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). Thus, mobile cloud has extended its computation model from centralized to distributed, from Internet cloud to edge cloud, and from mobile devices to mobile services. In this survey paper we investigate the pre-existing works in MCC to determine their role in the current trends for edge computing. We provide a holistic overview on the exploitation of EC for the realization of pervasive mobile applications and we briefly present the state-of-the art of edge computing paradigms and the key enabling technologies.

The computer-intensive applications and the Internet of Things (IoT) are the primary driving force behind the unprecedented and exponential growth of network traffic in recent times. It has also generated an enormous demand for computational requirements to meet the ever-growing and anticipated evolution of 5G networks. However, it is pertinent to highlight that the end-users, despite all this, continue to struggle with small storage-capacities and limited processing speed. To address this issue, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is the way forward, as it is the technology supporting the evolution of the 5G communication networks. Since it can host intensive computing applications, it creates efficient optimization of mobile resources. Before transmitting it to the cloud, it can also process extensive data and provide mobile users near proximity to cloud computing capabilities within the Radio Access Network (RAN). It offers context-aware services through the deployment of RAN knowledge. MEC, therefore, makes a wide range of applications where real-time response is appropriate, e.g. driverless cars, virtual reality, robotics and live media.

All of this produced information is passed to cloud servers for processing. As this process adds delay to processing, so it is not suitable for certain applications as some applications require a speedy response. To overcome this condition, fog computing comes in existent, which is an extension to cloud computing. Also, in the present time, fog is the most popular technology due to the vast demand for IoT devices. The fog nodes are placed between IoT devices and the cloud servers. As the execution of the request is performed at the fog layer so it can work with a limited number of resources i.e., less bandwidth, cost, and time as the processing is pushed closer to the end clients. The most challenging task in a fog environment is to appropriately distribute workload among computing nodes during the execution of IoT applications as it is one of the important factors which affect resource efficiency. The performance of any computing paradigm is directly proportional to the load balancing handling mechanism; poor mechanism reduces the overall performance of any computing environment. Realizing the challenge of load balancing among the computing nodes in the fog environment, various mechanisms and methods have been proposed so far and various experiments have also been conducted by the researchers to check the effectiveness of the mechanism. The appropriate load balancing mechanism will increase the effectiveness of the fog system due to better resource utilization. The chapter presents a framework (OLBA) for Load Balancing in Fog computing environments to balance the load between fog devices and improves QoS parameters i.e., Turnaround time resource utilization, response time, and delay parameter. This approach is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to find the local best and then to compare all the local best to find the ultimate global best solution.

Still, there is no end-to-end system platform that allows to deploy, update, manage and execute AI models in pervasive systems. We propose such a system platform in this paper. Most importantly, we reuse concepts and techniques from twenty years of pervasive computing research on how to enable runtime adaptation and apply it to AI. This allows to specify adaptive AI models that are able to react to a multitude of dynamic changes, e.g. with respect to available devices, networking conditions, but also application requirements and sensor data sources. Developers can optimise their applications iteratively, starting with a generic setup and refining it step by step towards their specific pervasive computing scenario. To show the applicability of our platform, we apply it to two pervasive use cases and evaluate them, achieving up to four times faster inference and three times lower energy consumption compared to a classical AI deployment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42486-021-00070-6,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

To solve the problems above, a seamless handover scheme for wireless access points based on perception is proposed. First, a seamless handover model based on load perception is proposed to solve the unbalanced network load, in which a seamless handover algorithm for wireless access points is used to calculate the access point with the highest weight, and a software-defined network controller controls the switching process. A joint allocation method of communication and computing resources based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to minimize the terminal energy consumption and the system delay. A resource allocation model is based on minimizing terminal energy consumption, and system delay is built. The optimal value of task offloading decision and resource allocation vector are calculated with deep reinforcement learning.

In order to deal with these challenges, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising solution. MEC pushes powerful computational and storage capacities from the remote cloud to the edge of networks in close proximity of vehicular users, which enables low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption.

In this context, we consider a general system consisting of a multi-cell communication network where each base station (BS) is equipped with a MEC server to provide computation offloading services to nearby mobile users. In addition, each SMD handles multiple independent offloadable heavy tasks that are latency-sensitive. The purpose of this article is to jointly optimize tasks’ offloading decisions as well as the allocation of critical radio resources while minimizing the overall energy consumption. Therefore, we have formulated a bi-objective optimization problem that is NP-hard. Because of the short decision time constraint, the optimal solution implementation is infeasible. Accordingly, with the use of the weighted aggregation approach, we propose Intelligent Truncation based Hybrid Local Search (ITHLS) solution. In critical radio resources situations, our solution jointly minimizes the number of penalized SMDs and the overall consumed energy. Finally, simulation experiments were realized to study the ITHLS solution performance compared to some effective state of the art solutions, and the simulation results in terms of decision-making time, energy and number of truncated SMDs are very promising.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-09365-9,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Besides, different service architectures and offloading strategies have a different impact on the service time performance of IoT applications. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for task offloading in an Edge-Cloud system in order to minimize the overall service time for latency-sensitive applications. This approach adopts fuzzy logic algorithms, considering application characteristics (e.g., CPU demand, network demand and delay sensitivity) as well as resource utilization and resource heterogeneity. A number of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach with other related approaches, where it was found to improve the overall service time for latency-sensitive applications and utilize the edge-cloud resources effectively.

However, due to the densified heterogeneous deployment of BSs, the end device may be covered by more than one BS, which brings new challenges for offloading decision, that is whether and where to offload computing tasks for low latency and energy cost. This paper formulates a multi-user-to-multi-servers (MUMS) edge computing problem in ultra-dense cellular networks. The MUMS problem is divided and conquered by two phases, which are server selection and offloading decision. For the server selection phases, mobile users are grouped to one BS considering both physical distance and workload. After the grouping, the original problem is divided into parallel multi-user-to-one-server offloading decision subproblems. To get fast and near-optimal solutions for these subproblems, a distributed offloading strategy based on a binary-coded genetic algorithm is designed to get an adaptive offloading decision. Convergence analysis of the genetic algorithm is given and extensive simulations show that the proposed strategy significantly reduces the average latency and energy consumption of mobile devices. Compared with the state-of-the-art offloading researches, our strategy reduces the average delay by 56% and total energy consumption by 14% in the ultra-dense cellular networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13677-021-00232-y,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

This way, computational tasks can be offloaded from end devices to nearby fog nodes, thus benefiting from high computational power and low latency at the same time. Architecture plays a central role in fog computing. Many papers on fog computing address architectural questions. However, a closer look reveals that different papers use the term “architecture” for very different concepts. This is rooted in the multi-disciplinary nature of the fog computing paradigm. The different communities involved in fog computing—network, hardware, system software, application software—all use the term “architecture,” but with different meaning. To facilitate the mutual understanding of architectural issues in fog computing, this paper introduces a conceptual framework for reasoning about architecture in fog computing.

The concept addresses the convergence of the edge intelligence embedded in the vehicles based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with the cooperative, collaborative intelligence distributed into the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge computing infrastructure federated with the hierarchical cognitive processes and analytics in physical, network, infrastructure, and data spaces. IoV integrates and links the ECAS vehicles’ domains with the intra-vehicle networks, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, the processing and cognitive functions provided by federated platforms using the intelligent edge and cloud computing infrastructure. The cognitive transformation of vehicles and the integration of immersive technologies, i.e., virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) combined with intelligent connectivity, IoT, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), digital twins (DTs), data, knowledge, security/privacy requirements and learning platforms provide the technological foundation of IoV allowing for entirely new services, applications, and user experiences. The paper advances the latest architectural concepts for ECAS vehicles. It proposes an IoV 3D multi-layered architecture that combines AI, edge computing and connectivity as part of the functional layers while integrating the system properties and trustworthiness properties into the overall architecture to provide efficient new mobility applications and services. The proposed system of systems concept for IoV applications allows for distributed intelligent functions to be embedded into the edge and cloud infrastructure for ECAS vehicles to provide a computing, processing, and intelligent connectivity continuum for IoV applications and services.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-76493-7_4,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

This concept can be implemented combining both the Mobile Edge Computing model and relatively large-scale centralized Data Centers.

Cloud computing systems, also known as a solution that offloads energy-consuming computation of IoT applications to a cloud server, cannot meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements. To address this issue, an edge computing system provides timely and context-aware services by bringing the computations and storage closer to the user. The dynamic flow of requests that can be efficiently processed is a significant challenge for edge and cloud computing systems. To improve the performance of IoT systems, the mobile edge orchestrator (MEO), which is an application placement controller, was designed by integrating end mobile devices with edge and cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose a flexible computation offloading method in a fuzzy-based MEO for IoT applications in order to improve the efficiency in computational resource management. Considering the network, computation resources, and task requirements, a fuzzy-based MEO allows edge workload orchestration actions to decide whether to offload a mobile user to local edge, neighboring edge, or cloud servers. Additionally, increasing packet sizes will affect the failed-task ratio when the number of mobile devices increases. To reduce failed tasks because of transmission collisions and to improve service times for time-critical tasks, we define a new input crisp value, and a new output decision for a fuzzy-based MEO. Using the EdgeCloudSim simulator, we evaluate our proposal with four benchmark algorithms in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications. Simulation results show that our proposal provides better results in terms of WLAN delay, service times, the number of failed tasks, and VM utilization.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13677-020-00211-9,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects.

With the rapid development of IoT, the fog computing paradigm is emerging as an attractive solution for processing the data of IoT applications. In the fog environment, IoT applications are executed by the intermediate computing nodes in the fog, as well as the physical servers in cloud data centers. On the other hand, due to the resource limitations, resource heterogeneity, dynamic nature, and unpredictability of fog environment, it necessitates the resource management issues as one of the challenging problems to be considered in the fog landscape.

When considering Edge Computing, it is possible to design a three-tier architecture (comprising tiers for the cloud devices, edge devices, and end devices) which is useful to meet emerging IoT applications that demand low latency, geo-localization, and energy efficiency. Like the Cloud, the Edge Computing paradigm relies on virtualization. An Edge Computing virtualization model provides a set of virtual nodes (VNs) built on top of the physical devices that make up the three-tier architecture. It also provides the processes of provisioning and allocating VNs to IoT applications at the edge of the network. Performing these processes efficiently and cost-effectively raises a resource management challenge. Applying the traditional cloud virtualization models (typically centralized) to virtualize the edge tier, are unsuitable to handle emerging IoT application scenarios due to the specific features of the edge nodes, such as geographical distribution, heterogeneity and, resource constraints. Therefore, we propose a novel distributed and lightweight virtualization model targeting the edge tier, encompassing the specific requirements of IoT applications. We designed heuristic algorithms along with a P2P collaboration process to operate in our virtualization model. The algorithms perform (i) a distributed resource management process, and (ii) data sharing among neighboring VNs. The distributed resource management process provides each edge node with decision-making capability, engaging neighboring edge nodes to allocate or provision on-demand VNs. Thus, the distributed resource management improves system performance, serving more requests and handling edge node geographical distribution. Meanwhile, data sharing reduces the data transmissions between end devices and edge nodes, saving energy and reducing data traffic for IoT-edge infrastructures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-019-00722-9,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

The existing standards on 5G mainly concentrate on the following issues: 10 Gigabyte data rate, 1-millisecond latency, high bandwidth per unit area, 99.999% availability, 100% coverage and 90% reduction in network energy usage. Hence, 5G has the capability to support various types of communications from the low power Local Area Network (LAN) to Wide Area Networks (WAN) with low-latency and high-speed. It allows human-to-human (H2H), human-to-machine (H2M) interactions for exchanging of data and signals. So, for better data transmission between different entities (for example, smart objects located across different geographic locations), efficient communication between billions of smart devices is required and the associated technology is called as “ Internet of Things ”. However, issues such as- latency-tolerant, low-data rate, high complexity, privacy and security in existing solutions may deteriorate the performance of any implemented solution in this environment. To mitigate the above-mentioned problems, the literature suggests that fog computing can be one of the options as it provides ultra-low-latency for Tactile-based applications. Tactile Internet is an emerging technology used for H2M interactions to support high-reliability, ultra-responsive, and high fidelity. Keeping focus on all the aforementioned challenges and constraints, in this paper, we provide an analysis on the usage of the strong backbone infrastructure of fog computing for 5G-enabled Tactile Internet with a maximum bandwidth of 1 Gigabyte having the minimum latency of 1-millisecond. It supports low-latency and high-reliability in Tactile-based applications. Keeping focus on the issues such as- resource management, communication infrastructure, fog orchestration, fog networking, healthcare, security and privacy of fog system in Tactile-based applications, we have explored and compared the existing state-of-the-art proposals using various parameters such as- energy-efficient, QoS, scalability, mobility, and interoperability. In addition, a number of open research challenges of fog computing for 5G-enabled Tactile Internet are also explored to provide deep insights to the readers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-019-01430-4,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

In this paper, we investigate a novel paradigm to deploy multimedia elastic applications at the edge in a very energy-efficient manner. Our approach is based on pre-provisioning virtual resources that remain “frozen” until the application scales out. Frozen resources are treated in a special way by the infrastructure, leveraging aggressive power-saving mechanisms that keep negligible their impact on energy consumption and performance. We report extensive measurements on QoS and power consumption that we carried out in a real testbed, which is the first working implementation of the proposed paradigm. Our work shows how resource utilization and performance can be increased by leveraging SDN technologies and conscious setting of cloud parameters. We investigate the trade-off between performance and power consumption (i.e., energy efficiency), in relation to different consolidation strategies. Finally, we measure power consumption and estimate energy saving for an elastic video transcoding application deployed at the network edge.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-018-7050-x,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

This could offer many benefits to the global vehicular network including, for example, lower latency, network off-loading and context-awareness (location, environment factors, etc.).

For that purpose their main features are compared and the state-of-the-art applications in VANETs are analyzed.

Recently, various types of Plug-and-Produce architectures were proposed that support the discovery, integration and configuration of field devices, automation equipment or industrial robots during commissioning or even operation of manufacturing systems. However, in many of these approaches, the configuration possibilities are limited, which is a particular problem if robots operate in dynamic environments with constrained workspaces and exchangeable automation components as typically required for flexible manufacturing processes. In this article, we introduce an extended Plug-and-Produce concept based on dynamic motion planning, co-simulation and a collaborative human-robot interaction scheme that facilitates the quick adaptation of robotics behaviors in the context of a modular production system. To confirm our hypothesis on the efficiency and usability of this concept, we carried out a feasibility study where participants performed a flexible workcell setup. The results indicate that the assistance and features for planning effectively support the users in tasks of different complexity and that a quick adaption is indeed possible.

Accordingly, the enlargement of distributed MEC installments will be realized and their power consumption might be a significant problem in terms of operating costs for service providers. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for MEC server clustering to minimize power consumption of the MEC environment. To do this, considering power consumption behavior of MEC servers using CPUs with dynamic voltage frequency scaling, we propose a power-efficient clustering scheme (PECS) that minimizes power consumption of MEC servers by obtaining the optimal number of clusters through convex optimization. Numerical results reveal the proposed PECS reduces power consumption of the MEC environment by 12.32% relative to an existing scheme while sustaining average delay of inflows processed in MEC servers at the acceptable level without turning off MEC servers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-018-1164-2,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

In this work, we present a design pattern, named Self-organising Coordination Regions (SCR), which aims to support scalable monitoring and control in distributed systems. Specifically, it is a decentralised coordination pattern for partitioned orchestration of devices (typically on a spatial basis), which provides adaptivity, resilience, and distributed decision-making in large-scale situated systems. It works through a self-organising construction of regions of space, where internal coordination activities are regulated via feedback/control flows among leaders and worker nodes.

In this regard, driver assistance and autonomous driving technology are gaining more attention. Such technology has the potential to reduce road accidents, traffic congestion, and fuel usage. However, vehicles cannot become fully autonomous, until they are able to sense their context efficiently (context sensing), and to use ambient learning to respond appropriately and within short timescales to the data they have sensed. Context sharing will also become essential, because a single vehicle will not be able to gain a holistic view of its context without cooperation from other nearby vehicles and from the roadside infrastructure. Indeed, there are further advantages when a group of vehicles make intelligent decisions based on a common understanding of their context. This chapter highlights the significance of ambient intelligence for next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles, describes its current state of the art, and also shows how its potential might be achieved. One of the main challenges refers to how to provision and coordinate cloud-based services to meet the needs of real-time (low latency) data-intensive (high data rate) ambient intelligence, particularly for safety-critical vehicular safety applications. It indicates how autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles are likely to make seamless use of any available wireless networking technologies to improve both coverage and reliability and, where feasible, to cache critical content near the network edge so as to minimize the number of network hops and hence service latencies.

Indeed, the 5G system aims to respond to a wide range of services including Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and, therefore, vehicular communications. However, the current Cooperative-Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) architecture does not meet the key design recommendations of the 5G architecture design. Thus, this integration is not possible yet. Indeed, five different improvements should be considered to make it possible: network intelligence and automation, edge data processing and interoperability, network control, environment virtualization and finally security and privacy. Different papers have already proposed architectures enabling some of these improvements through the integration of different technologies in the C-ITS architecture. To highlight their strengths and their limits, these states-of-the-art solutions are compared. None of them propose a solution meeting the five identified improvements. That is why this paper presents a new architecture taking all these improvements into account. In particular, to complete the existing work, automation, security, privacy and trust are considered. To do so, a knowledge plane enhancing the functioning of the whole architecture is designed. Moreover, a security and privacy plane, strengthening trust in the vehicular environment thanks to Blockchain, is proposed.

If failed to consider about this, the existing offloading schemes may cause user to overspend, this is unacceptable to user. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the task offloading problem in edge-cloud computing aiming to minimize the task duration while tasks are generated by user with constrainted budget. Besides edge servers are equipped with limited computation and storage resources. Specifically, the problem we formulate is an NP-hard problem. In order to solve it, we propose a heuristic strategy.

SDN is playing a key role in deploying mobile network services on network function virtualization (NFV) infrastructure for elastic and flexible deployment of core network services e.g., virtualization of evolved packet core in LTE to efficiently handle huge control signal overhead and traffic demands from machine-to-machine and internet of things devices. Besides, NFV and SDN are offering scalable, flexible and adaptable network service chaining platforms as a replacement for inflexible middleboxes. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new evolving platform which brings together IT services and cloud computing for offering end-users network aware services and solutions. In this survey, we enumerate numerous issues and challenges in designing SDN based wireless networks and review various SDN based seminal solutions for 4G/5G. Finally, this survey presents the role of SDN, NFV and MEC in designing 5G networks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-017-4825-8,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

The use-cases and the disruptive capabilities of 5G will bring forward a number of challenges for both the wireless radio and wired part of a 5G network. The wired transport network, typically consisting of access and core domains, has to adopt tailored networking solutions satisfying differentiated quality of service requirements as envisioned in 5G. While optical transport technology has been prevalent in core segments, it is also perceived as a key enabler for the 5G access networks due to its very high capacity and low transmission delay. However, existing optical transport technologies are hindered by inflexibility, poor resource utilization, and high costs, and cannot be stretched to 5G scale. On the other hand, optical technologies have been going through a paradigm shift towards an elastic optical network that is considered as the promising solution for future high-speed transport networks. This paper outlines key challenges for the design of a flexible, programmable, and dynamic 5G transport network, and discusses the enabling technologies and directions to address these challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10922-017-9434-z,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

In Small Cell enabled Mobile Edge Computing deployments, the impact of virtualization technologies is significant in two main aspects: the design and deployment of the telecommunication infrastructure, and the delivery of edge services. Besides, the adoption of virtualization technologies has implications also in the implementation of Self Organizing Network (SON) services and in the enforcement of Service Level Agreement (SLA) policies, both critical in the automation of the delivery of multi-tenant oriented services in such complex infrastructure. From the work performed by the H2020 SESAME project, the beneficial use of virtualization techniques emerges in adding network intelligence and services in the network edge. SESAME relays on virtualization for providing Small Cell as a Service (SCaaS) and per operator Edge Computing services, consolidating the emerging multi-tenancy driven design paradigms in communication infrastructures.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-65172-9_61,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Such trend is accompanied by remarkable progresses of miniaturised electronics, together with the proliferation of social services and computation intensive applications such as high definition video. On one hand, the current mobile network is unable to deliver sufficiently high data rates per user in order to support this growth, and a possible solution is provided by the dense deployment of small cell devices. On the other, mobile operators are struggling to lower costs of deployment and maintenance while keeping profitable revenues. This paper aims to provide overview of the solution developed by the 5G-PPP SESAME project. SESAME proposes to leverage on the concept of Small Cell-as-a-service (SCaaS), providing the complete architectural solution to deploy cloud-enabled small cells. The key innovations developed by SESAME include the deployment of computation capabilities at the mobile network edge, and to exploit virtualisation techniques to manage and orchestrate dense small cell scenarios and different use cases.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-44944-9_60,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Existing pervasive games commonly rely on a device screen for providing game-related information, while overlooking opportunities to include new types of contextual interactions like jumping, a punching gesture, or even voice to be used as game inputs. We present the design of Spellbound, a physical mobile team-based game, to help contribute to our understanding of how we can design pervasive games that aim to nurture a spirit of togetherness. We also briefly touch upon how togetherness and playfulness can transform physical movement into a desirable activity in the user evaluation section. Spellbound is an outdoor pervasive team-based physical game. It takes advantage of the above-mentioned opportunities and integrates real-world actions like jumping and spinning with a virtual world. It also replaces touch-based input with voice interaction and provides glanceable and haptic feedback using custom hardware in the true spirit of social play characteristic of traditional children’s games. We believe Spellbound is a form of digital outdoor gaming that anchors enjoyment on physical action, social interaction, and tangible feedback. Spellbound was well received in user evaluation playtests which confirmed that the main design objective of enhancing a sense of togetherness was largely met.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-015-0845-0,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'

Though CDNs and CCDNs share similar functionalities, introduction of cloud impose additional challenges that have to be addressed for a successful CCDN deployment. Several papers have tried to address the issues and challenges around CDN with varying degree of success. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no clear articulation of issues and challenges problems within the context of cloud-based CDNs. Hence, this paper aims to identify the open challenges in cloud-based CDNs.

This real-world physicality makes the experience fun for game players, yet it brings the unique challenge of creating and orchestrating such a game. That is, location-based games are often difficult to create, grow, and maintain over long periods of time. Our research investigates how location-based games can be designed to overcome this challenge of scalability. We studied the well-established location-based game of Geocaching through active participation and an online survey to better understand how it has succeeded in maintaining user involvement and growth over the last decade. Findings show that Geocaching benefits by having players directly create game content, including both lightweight and elaborate creations. Geocaching has also made it simple for players to perform game orchestration by monitoring game content, other players, and even non-players. We then characterize location-based games according to various attributes and suggest how the lessons learned from Geocaching could be applied more generally to the design of other location-based games and in which cases they should not be applied.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00779-011-0497-7,springer,augmented reality,'augmented reality' AND 'edge' AND 'orchestration' AND 'placement'
