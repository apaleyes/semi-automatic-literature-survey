computing technologies, the infrastructure (compute and network) available to
emerging applications (AR/VR, autonomous driving, industry 4.0, etc.) has
become quite complex. There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT devices, near
edge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of
networking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and
management of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this
paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for
microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered
compute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements
are known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the
application are not specified. As part of our solution, ROMA identifies and
leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for
various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to
appropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex,
multi-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application
requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications
in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains.
Through extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55%
and 44% compute and up to 80%, 95% and 75% network bandwidth for the
surveillance (watchlist) and transportation application (person and car
detection), respectively. This improvement is achieved while honoring the
application performance requirements, and it is over an alternative scheme that
employs a static and overprovisioned resource allocation strategy by ignoring
the resource coupling relationships.",1,unknown

Due to the convergence in technologies, the scope of the Internet of things (IoT) has evolved to a new dimension, it expands from data collection to device interconnections, and to pre-processing. This acceleration involves cloud and fog computing layers into the system which plays an integral role in IoT data storage and computing. Due to the diversity present in IoT devices, selection of computation devices and allocation of resources are major challenges to be addressed for efficient utilization of resources. In this paper, we presented the offloading and resource allocation model to address the solution to the above challenge. Firstly, a 5-layered neuro-fuzzy model is introduced to retrieve the fuzzy sets and rules which further passes to the fuzzy inference system to model an orchestration decision system. Additionally, to improve the system performance, we have presented the modified least loaded resource allocation algorithm which is adaptively required to reduce the failure rate of the applications. To showcase the efficacy of the model, 4 healthcare applications (augmented reality, patient pre-monitoring, record analysis, and billing systems) are evaluated with their heterogeneous parameters. The simulation findings show that our suggested model improves system performance by lowering network latency by 2.23–9.68 %, computation delay by 3.40–13.66 %, and system performance by 1.03–11.55%.

Cloud computing systems, also known as a solution that offloads energy-consuming computation of IoT applications to a cloud server, cannot meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements. To address this issue, an edge computing system provides timely and context-aware services by bringing the computations and storage closer to the user. The dynamic flow of requests that can be efficiently processed is a significant challenge for edge and cloud computing systems. To improve the performance of IoT systems, the mobile edge orchestrator (MEO), which is an application placement controller, was designed by integrating end mobile devices with edge and cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose a flexible computation offloading method in a fuzzy-based MEO for IoT applications in order to improve the efficiency in computational resource management. Considering the network, computation resources, and task requirements, a fuzzy-based MEO allows edge workload orchestration actions to decide whether to offload a mobile user to local edge, neighboring edge, or cloud servers. Additionally, increasing packet sizes will affect the failed-task ratio when the number of mobile devices increases. To reduce failed tasks because of transmission collisions and to improve service times for time-critical tasks, we define a new input crisp value, and a new output decision for a fuzzy-based MEO. Using the EdgeCloudSim simulator, we evaluate our proposal with four benchmark algorithms in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications.

In such distributed environments, service providers will typically face tens, hundreds, or thousands of compute location candidates (edge, regional, and central) where network service components can be placed. To take optimized placement decisions of network services and execute the management workflows, orchestration systems require up-to-date and accurate resource availability representation, in the form of a network inventory that can be immense in distributed cloud scenarios. As a result, the service management and placement problems may become not tractable. In this work, we propose the Abstracted Network Inventory (ANI) component to generate service-optimized network views over the same network inventory. ANI implements a novel abstraction method where network service requirements are used as an input to generate an optimized abstract network inventory representation, called Logical Network Inventory (LNI). We also provide a formal definition of the network model and problem statement along with the development of three algorithms to efficiently build an LNI. Results show the potential benefits of using an LNI to streamline service management and placement: (i) the relationship between compute nodes and links (i.e., density) in an LNI is reduced between 1.8-2.7x compared to a full network inventory topology; and (ii) up to 50% of time can be saved for service placement after abstracting around 20% of the compute nodes.",4,unknown

These applications require advanced computing models which allow for the processing of massive gathered amounts of data. Motions, gestures and object modification should be captured, added to the virtual environment, and shared with all the participants. Relying only on the cloud to process this data can cause significant delays. Therefore, a hybrid cloud/edge architecturewith an intelligent resource orchestration mechanism, that is able to allocate the available capacities efficiently is necessary.

We investigate the problem of optimal placement of pipelines of application functions (virtual service chains) and the steering of traffic through them, over a multi-technology edge network model consisting of both wired and wireless millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. This problem is NP-hard. We provide a comprehensive “microscopic” binary integer program to model the system, along with a heuristic that is one order of magnitude faster than optimally solving the problem. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of orchestrating virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity.

Common orchestration solutions make placement decisions based only on the resources of the underlying network and the application resource requests; however, using the profiles of applications to make placement decisions has the potential to enhance the final performance perceived by the end-users. This paper proposes the use of application profiles according to their popularity to guide their placement. To corroborate the effectiveness of the use of the profiles, two placement mechanisms are presented, one based on Genetic Algorithm and the other inspired on graph partitions. Simulation results show that it is possible to reduce the latency and jitter of applications via a service placement guided by the profiles. The mechanism based on graph partitions showed better results for all scenarios, followed closely by the Genetic Algorithm in the scenarios with lower load.",7,unknown
