Industry 4.0 environments, since it is able to provide flexible, modular, and
reconfigurable services with low latency and reduced costs. Orchestration
systems are becoming the core component of clouds since they take decisions on
the placement and lifecycle of software components. Current solutions start
introducing real-time containers support for time predictability; however,
these approaches lack of determinism as well as support for workloads requiring
multiple levels of assurance/criticality.
  In this paper, we present k4.0s, an orchestration model for real-time and
mixed-criticality environments, which includes timeliness, criticality and
network requirements. The model leverages new abstractions for both node and
jobs, e.g., node assurance, and requires novel monitoring strategies. We sketch
an implementation of the proposal based on Kubernetes, and present an
experimentation motivating the need for node assurance levels and adequate
monitoring."

applications are applied in mobile devices because they are significantly
energy-guzzling. In this paper, we design an edge-based energy-aware MAR system
that enables MAR devices to dynamically change their configurations, such as
CPU frequency, computation model size, and image offloading frequency based on
user preferences, camera sampling rates, and available radio resources. Our
proposed dynamic MAR configuration adaptations can minimize the per frame
energy consumption of multiple MAR clients without degrading their preferred
MAR performance metrics, such as latency and detection accuracy. To thoroughly
analyze the interactions among MAR configurations, user preferences, camera
sampling rate, and energy consumption, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first comprehensive analytical energy model for MAR devices.
Based on the proposed analytical model, we design a LEAF optimization algorithm
to guide the MAR configuration adaptation and server radio resource allocation.
An image offloading frequency orchestrator, coordinating with the LEAF, is
developed to adaptively regulate the edge-based object detection invocations
and to further improve the energy efficiency of MAR devices. Extensive

computing technologies, the infrastructure (compute and network) available to
emerging applications (AR/VR, autonomous driving, industry 4.0, etc.) has
become quite complex. There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT devices, near
edge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of
networking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and
management of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this
paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for
microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered
compute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements
are known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the

leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for
various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to
appropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex,
multi-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application
requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications
in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains.
Through extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55%

a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of

resources such as virtual machines, storage, and network elements that must be
deployed over distinct infrastructures such as cloud computing, Cloud of Things
(CoT), datacenters and backbone networks. For massive IoT data acquisition, a
gateway-based data aggregation approach is commonly used featuring sensor/
actuator seamless access and providing cache/ buffering and preprocessing
functionality. In this perspective , gateways acting as producers need to
allocate network resources to send IoT data to consumers. In this paper, it is
proposed a Publish/-Subscribe (PubSub) quality of service (QoS) aware framework
(PSIoT-Orch) that orchestrates IoT traffic and allocates network resources
between aggregates and consumers for massive IoT traffic. PSIoT-Orch schedules
IoT data flows based on its configured QoS requirements. Additionally , the
framework allocates network resources (LSP/ bandwidth) over a controlled
backbone network with limited and constrained resources between IoT data users
and consumers. Network resources are allocated using a Bandwidth Allocation
Model (BAM) to achieve efficient network resource allocation for scheduled IoT
data streams. PSIoT-Orch adopts an ICN (Information-Centric Network) PubSub
architecture approach to handle IoT data transfers requests among framework
components. The proposed framework aims at gathering the inherent advantages of
an ICN-centric approach using a PubSub message scheme while allocating

improvements over popular pre-growth patterning methods are obtained.
Limitations of traditional post-growth patterning methods are circumvented by
selective transfer printing of CNTs with either thermoplastic or metallic

However, the demands generated by a plethora of innovative and concurrent IT services requiring high quality of service and quality of experience levels will likely overwhelm the—albeit considerable—resources available in 5G and Beyond scenarios. To take full advantage of its potential, MEC needs to be paired with innovative resource management solutions capable of effectively addressing the highly dynamic aspects of the scenario and of properly considering the heterogeneous and ever-changing nature of next generation IT services, prioritizing the assignment of resources in a highly dynamic and contextual fashion. This calls for the adoption of Artificial Intelligence based tools, implementing self-* approaches capable of learning the best resource management strategy to adapt to the ever changing conditions. In this paper, we present MECForge, a novel solution based on deep reinforcement learning that considers the maximization of total value-of-information delivered to end-user as a coherent and comprehensive resource management criterion.

A uniform communication standard such as OPC UA, a well-established global standard in the aforementioned manufacturing industries, is essential to a modular, scalable network of heterogeneous laboratory structures. Can the laboratory industry benefit from this standard and the years of development experience? In SPECTARIS, the German Industry Association for Optics, Photonics, Analytical and Medical Technologies, over 30 global market leaders, hidden champions and drivers of innovation in the laboratory industry put their heads together in the “Networked Laboratory Devices” working group and created the “Laboratory and Analytical Device Standard”, or LADS for short. Unlike numerous other attempts to establish communication standards for laboratories, LADS is based on the advanced OPC UA standard and takes an agnostic approach to cover the variety of devices, systems and requirements in laboratories. In this context, “agnostic” refers to the generic design and display of potentially as-yet-unknown aspects of the flow of information or communication structures. For the first time, LADS allows for modular, scalable networking of heterogeneous laboratory structures, efficient data transfers and – currently unused – user, process and device-based data analysis (keywords: big data, predictive analytics, data science) – even taking normative requirements into consideration. This agnostic modelling makes LADS a future-proof communication solution for the laboratory industry, the likes of which the world has never seen."

Though computation offloading over the cloud, edge, and terminals has been broadly studied, existing researches primarily establish scheduling algorithms on program high-level abstraction without consideration of challenges from program structures. We focus on task scheduling for offloading object-oriented applications while considering the ’encapsulation’ characteristic. We proposed a time-driven offloading strategy based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm employing the genetic algorithm operators with floating encoding (PGFE). This strategy introduces a genetic algorithm’s randomly two-point crossover and mutation operator to avoid converging on local optima effectively.

Since MEC servers have limited resources, an orchestrator utilizes a scheduling algorithm to decide where and when each task should execute so that the quality of service (QoS) of each task is achieved. The scheduling algorithm should use the least possible resources required to meet the service demands. In this paper, we develop a two-level cooperative scheduling algorithm with a centralized orchestrator layer. The first scheduling level is used to schedule tasks locally on MEC servers. In contrast, the second level resides at the orchestrator and assigns tasks to a neighboring base station or the cloud. The tasks serve in accordance with their priority, which is determined by the latency and required throughput. We also present a resource optimization algorithm for determining resource distribution in the system in order to ensure satisfactory service availability at the minimum cost. The resource optimization algorithm contains two variations that can be employed depending on the traffic model. One variant is used when the traffic is uniformly distributed, and the other is used when the traffic load is unbalanced among base stations. Numerical results show that the cooperative model of task scheduling outperforms the non-cooperative model. Furthermore, the results show that the suggested scheduling algorithm performs better than other well-known scheduling algorithms, such as shortest job first scheduling and earliest deadline first scheduling."

Heterogeneity, dynamism, and the growing number of computational devices in fog computing make reliability a challenge because failure is inevitable in such an environment. This work replicates an application on more than one fog node to ensure required reliability. But fog nodes may not offer the services free of cost. Therefore, to meet reliability requirement, IoT user has to pay more. Further, since fog owners may be autonomous, rational, and intelligent, they may hide the true cost of their fog resources. Therefore, the truthfulness of fog owners also becomes an important challenge. To address increased payment by IoT users and to ensure reliability and the truthfulness of fog owners, this work formulates the application placement problem considering the computational and reliability requirement of the IoT devices/users to minimize total payment. It is proved that the formulated problem is NP-hard. For a sub-optimal solution in polynomial time, this work proposes a greedy-based truthfulness and reliability-aware application placement policy (TRAPPY).

The VNF is responsible for network services that run on virtual machines and can connect each of them alone or organize themselves into a single enclosure to use all the resources available in that enclosure. This flexibility allows physical and virtual resources to be used in a way that ensures control over power consumption, balance in resource use, and minimizing costs and latency. In order to consolidate VNF groups into a minimum number of virtual machine (VM) with estimation of the association relation to a measure of confidence under the context of possibility theory, we propose a new Fuzzy-FCA approach for VNF placement based on formal concept analysis (FCA) and fuzzy logic in mixed environment based on cloud data centers and Multiple access edge computing (MEC) architecture.

The results of the series of experiments carried out show the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm. Indeed, the harvested results confirm the capability of maximizing and balancing the use of resources, of minimizing the latency and the cost of energy consumption.

The original joint scaling and placement problem is known to be NP-hard and hence the problem is solved by separating scaling and placement problems and solving them individually. The experiments are done using a dataset containing the information of a deployed digital-twin network service. These experiments show that considering transport and cloud parameters during scaling and placement algorithms perform more efficiently than the only cloud based or transport based scaling followed by placement algorithms. One of the MADM algorithms, Total Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), has shown to yield the lowest deployment cost and highest VNF request satisfaction rates compared to only transport or cloud scaling and other investigated MADM algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that considering both transport and cloud parameters in various availability scenarios of cloud and transport resources has significant potential to provide increased request satisfaction rates when VNF scaling and placement using the TOPSIS scheme is performed."

The service placement issue can be modeled through a multi-objective optimization aiming at minimizing two aspects: the response time for data transmission and processing in the sensors-edge-cloud path; the (energy or monetary) cost related to the number of turned on edge nodes. Two heuristics, based on Variable Neighborhood Search and on Genetic Algorithms, are proposed and evaluated over a wide range of scenarios, considering a realistic smart city application with 100 sensors and up to 10 edge nodes. Both heuristics can return practical solutions for the given application. The results indicate a suitable topology for a network-bound scenario requires less enabled edge nodes comparatively with a CPU-bound scenario. In terms of performance gain, the VNS outperformed in almost every condition the GA approach, reaching a performance gain up to almost 40% when the network delay plays a significant role and when the load is higher. Hence, the experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed heuristics are useful to support the design of edge computing infrastructures for modern AI-based applications relying on data collected by geographically distributed IoT sensors."

The computer-intensive applications and the Internet of Things (IoT) are the primary driving force behind the unprecedented and exponential growth of network traffic in recent times. It has also generated an enormous demand for computational requirements to meet the ever-growing and anticipated evolution of 5G networks. However, it is pertinent to highlight that the end-users, despite all this, continue to struggle with small storage-capacities and limited processing speed. To address this issue, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is the way forward, as it is the technology supporting the evolution of the 5G communication networks. Since it can host intensive computing applications, it creates efficient optimization of mobile resources. Before transmitting it to the cloud, it can also process extensive data and provide mobile users near proximity to cloud computing capabilities within the Radio Access Network (RAN). It offers context-aware services through the deployment of RAN knowledge. MEC, therefore, makes a wide range of applications where real-time response is appropriate, e.g. driverless cars, virtual reality, robotics and live media. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), dense heterogeneous networks (HetNets), cloud radio access networks (C-RAN), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), IoT, wireless power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH) and machine learning (ML) are all main technologies for 5G. The MEC summary, including the fundamental characteristics, challenges and market factors, is presented in this chapter. In addition to the integration of MEC with the upcoming 5G and beyond technologies including NOMA, WPT EH, UAV, IoT and heterogeneous CRAN and ML, we also address the role of MEC in the 5G network architecture. In doing so, we address the state of the art research activities and describe the potential of MEC’s future course."

But a majority of scheduling policies for the MEC environment consider offloading and execution of tasks only between two computing platforms: (i) mobile and edge or (ii) edge and cloud. In this paper, we consider the scheduling of a set of user applications with partial offloading and execution of tasks in all the three layers of compute stack: the mobile device, edge, and the cloud, to minimize the energy consumption of the edge nodes. Our extensive simulation reveals that the proposed scheduling strategy achieves an energy reduction up to 30% with an execution speedup up to 6% while meeting the delay constraints of the applications."

All of this produced information is passed to cloud servers for processing. As this process adds delay to processing, so it is not suitable for certain applications as some applications require a speedy response. To overcome this condition, fog computing comes in existent, which is an extension to cloud computing. Also, in the present time, fog is the most popular technology due to the vast demand for IoT devices. The fog nodes are placed between IoT devices and the cloud servers. As the execution of the request is performed at the fog layer so it can work with a limited number of resources i.e., less bandwidth, cost, and time as the processing is pushed closer to the end clients. The most challenging task in a fog environment is to appropriately distribute workload among computing nodes during the execution of IoT applications as it is one of the important factors which affect resource efficiency. The performance of any computing paradigm is directly proportional to the load balancing handling mechanism; poor mechanism reduces the overall performance of any computing environment. Realizing the challenge of load balancing among the computing nodes in the fog environment, various mechanisms and methods have been proposed so far and various experiments have also been conducted by the researchers to check the effectiveness of the mechanism. The appropriate load balancing mechanism will increase the effectiveness of the fog system due to better resource utilization. The chapter presents a framework (OLBA) for Load Balancing in Fog computing environments to balance the load between fog devices and improves QoS parameters i.e., Turnaround time resource utilization, response time, and delay parameter. This approach is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to find the local best and then to compare all the local best to find the ultimate global best solution. An analysis and comparison with the traditional techniques, i.e., FCFS, SJF, Max_Min is also performed for a better understanding of load balancing mechanism in Fog Computing."

In addition, each SMD handles multiple independent offloadable heavy tasks that are latency-sensitive. The purpose of this article is to jointly optimize tasks’ offloading decisions as well as the allocation of critical radio resources while minimizing the overall energy consumption. Therefore, we have formulated a bi-objective optimization problem that is NP-hard. Because of the short decision time constraint, the optimal solution implementation is infeasible. Accordingly, with the use of the weighted aggregation approach, we propose Intelligent Truncation based Hybrid Local Search (ITHLS) solution. In critical radio resources situations, our solution jointly minimizes the number of penalized SMDs and the overall consumed energy. Finally, simulation experiments were realized to study the ITHLS solution performance compared to some effective state of the art solutions, and the simulation results in terms of decision-making time, energy and number of truncated SMDs are very promising."

This paper formulates a multi-user-to-multi-servers (MUMS) edge computing problem in ultra-dense cellular networks. The MUMS problem is divided and conquered by two phases, which are server selection and offloading decision. For the server selection phases, mobile users are grouped to one BS considering both physical distance and workload. After the grouping, the original problem is divided into parallel multi-user-to-one-server offloading decision subproblems. To get fast and near-optimal solutions for these subproblems, a distributed offloading strategy based on a binary-coded genetic algorithm is designed to get an adaptive offloading decision. Convergence analysis of the genetic algorithm is given and extensive simulations show that the proposed strategy significantly reduces the average latency and energy consumption of mobile devices. Compared with the state-of-the-art offloading researches, our strategy reduces the average delay by 56% and total energy consumption by 14% in the ultra-dense cellular networks."

In this chapter, we explore such data plane optimization problems. We start with the basic problem of incrementally deploying SDN-enabled switches in the data plane of a traditional (non-SDN) network. Following that, we explore methods for optimizing the behavior of these switches to support various important SDN applications such as traffic engineering, coordinated scheduling, network slicing, security, fault management, and network measurement."

This chapter is devoted to the existing technologies of using 5G network for IoT and solutions to apply them in industrial automation. Initially explored in this chapter are the possibilities of using a 5G network for IoT, types of communication, network technologies, and management issues and the possibilities of processing edge computing, big data, and mobile cloud computing. Also, the 5G-enabled IoT architecture, structure, and construction principles are analyzed. Several stages of applying 5G-enabled IoT systems in industrial digitization and important information on the requirements for their indicators in industrial automation, such as requirements for data rate, scalability, reliability, latency, resilience, long battery lifetime, and connection density, mobility, and security, have been analyzed. Also, the existing technologies (such as WNFV, HetNet, D2D, M2M, massive MIMO, and 5G-enabled IoT for industrial purposes) currently used in 5G-based IoT for industrial automation have been studied, and their solutions such as requirements of 5G network and resource allocation optimization have been explored."

This way, computational tasks can be offloaded from end devices to nearby fog nodes, thus benefiting from high computational power and low latency at the same time. Architecture plays a central role in fog computing. Many papers on fog computing address architectural questions. However, a closer look reveals that different papers use the term “architecture” for very different concepts. This is rooted in the multi-disciplinary nature of the fog computing paradigm. The different communities involved in fog computing—network, hardware, system software, application software—all use the term “architecture,” but with different meaning. To facilitate the mutual understanding of architectural issues in fog computing, this paper introduces a conceptual framework for reasoning about architecture in fog computing. This conceptual framework uses three independent dimensions to describe architecture. Based on the three architecture dimensions, several architecture views can be defined to serve the different viewpoints of the involved disciplines, and to highlight different aspects of the architecture. The conceptual framework is validated using a literature mapping study."

Cloud computing systems, also known as a solution that offloads energy-consuming computation of IoT applications to a cloud server, cannot meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements. To address this issue, an edge computing system provides timely and context-aware services by bringing the computations and storage closer to the user. The dynamic flow of requests that can be efficiently processed is a significant challenge for edge and cloud computing systems. To improve the performance of IoT systems, the mobile edge orchestrator (MEO), which is an application placement controller, was designed by integrating end mobile devices with edge and cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose a flexible computation offloading method in a fuzzy-based MEO for IoT applications in order to improve the efficiency in computational resource management. Considering the network, computation resources, and task requirements, a fuzzy-based MEO allows edge workload orchestration actions to decide whether to offload a mobile user to local edge, neighboring edge, or cloud servers. Additionally, increasing packet sizes will affect the failed-task ratio when the number of mobile devices increases. To reduce failed tasks because of transmission collisions and to improve service times for time-critical tasks, we define a new input crisp value, and a new output decision for a fuzzy-based MEO. Using the EdgeCloudSim simulator, we evaluate our proposal with four benchmark algorithms in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications.

However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears."

However, the movement of users could induce service migration or interruption in the MEC network. Especially for highly mobile users, they accelerate the frequency of services’ migration and handover, impacting on the stability of the total MEC network. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-access edge computing architecture, setting up the infrastructure for dynamic service migration in the ultra-dense MEC networks. Moreover, we propose a new mechanism for users with high mobility in the ultra-dense MEC network, efficiently arranging service migrations for users with high-mobility and ordinary users together. Then, we propose an algorithm for evaluating migrated services to contribute to choose the suitable MEC servers for migrated services. The results show that the proposed mechanism can efficiently arrange service migrations and more quickly restore the services even in the blockage. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm is able to make a supplement to the existing algorithms for selecting MEC servers because it can better reflect the capability of migrated services."

Bringing AR/VR to the next level to enable immersive interconnected AR/VR will require significant advances towards 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and a Tactile Internet of Things (IoT).

When considering Edge Computing, it is possible to design a three-tier architecture (comprising tiers for the cloud devices, edge devices, and end devices) which is useful to meet emerging IoT applications that demand low latency, geo-localization, and energy efficiency. Like the Cloud, the Edge Computing paradigm relies on virtualization. An Edge Computing virtualization model provides a set of virtual nodes (VNs) built on top of the physical devices that make up the three-tier architecture. It also provides the processes of provisioning and allocating VNs to IoT applications at the edge of the network. Performing these processes efficiently and cost-effectively raises a resource management challenge. Applying the traditional cloud virtualization models (typically centralized) to virtualize the edge tier, are unsuitable to handle emerging IoT application scenarios due to the specific features of the edge nodes, such as geographical distribution, heterogeneity and, resource constraints. Therefore, we propose a novel distributed and lightweight virtualization model targeting the edge tier, encompassing the specific requirements of IoT applications. We designed heuristic algorithms along with a P2P collaboration process to operate in our virtualization model. The algorithms perform (i) a distributed resource management process, and (ii) data sharing among neighboring VNs. The distributed resource management process provides each edge node with decision-making capability, engaging neighboring edge nodes to allocate or provision on-demand VNs. Thus, the distributed resource management improves system performance, serving more requests and handling edge node geographical distribution. Meanwhile, data sharing reduces the data transmissions between end devices and edge nodes, saving energy and reducing data traffic for IoT-edge infrastructures."

Recently, specific strategies for the edge have emerged to face the challenges of dynamically changing conditions in heterogeneous architectures. This work aims to establish a quantitative evaluation approach for edge orchestration strategies.

All strategies show a better average response time during our experiment. However, the strategies result in different outcomes for other QoS measurements, like resource utilization.

Edge and fog computing represent practical solutions to counter the huge communication needs between IoT devices and the cloud. Considering the complexity and heterogeneity of edge and fog computing, however, resource provisioning remains the Achilles heel of efficiency for IoT applications. According to the importance of operating-system virtualization (so-called containerization), we propose an application-aware container scheduler that helps to orchestrate dynamic heterogeneous resources of edge and fog architectures. By considering available computational capacity, the proximity of computational resources to data producers and consumers, and the dynamic system status, our proposed scheduling mechanism selects the most adequate host to achieve the minimum response time for a given IoT service. We show how a hybrid use of containers and serverless microservices improves the performance of running IoT applications in fog-edge clouds and lowers usage fees.

Different approaches of edge computing have been developed: mobile edge computing (MEC), fog computing (FC) and cloudlet are the main ones. After introducing the vehicular environment background, this paper aims to study and compare these different technologies. For that purpose their main features are compared and the state-of-the-art applications in VANETs are analyzed. In addition, MEC, FC, and cloudlet are classified and their suitability level is debated for different types of vehicular applications. Finally, some challenges and future research directions in the fields of edge computing and VANETs are discussed."

Recently, various types of Plug-and-Produce architectures were proposed that support the discovery, integration and configuration of field devices, automation equipment or industrial robots during commissioning or even operation of manufacturing systems. However, in many of these approaches, the configuration possibilities are limited, which is a particular problem if robots operate in dynamic environments with constrained workspaces and exchangeable automation components as typically required for flexible manufacturing processes. In this article, we introduce an extended Plug-and-Produce concept based on dynamic motion planning, co-simulation and a collaborative human-robot interaction scheme that facilitates the quick adaptation of robotics behaviors in the context of a modular production system. To confirm our hypothesis on the efficiency and usability of this concept, we carried out a feasibility study where participants performed a flexible workcell setup. The results indicate that the assistance and features for planning effectively support the users in tasks of different complexity and that a quick adaption is indeed possible. Based on our observations, we identify further research challenges in the context of Plug, Plan and Produce applied to smart manufacturing."

Accordingly, the enlargement of distributed MEC installments will be realized and their power consumption might be a significant problem in terms of operating costs for service providers. Thus, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for MEC server clustering to minimize power consumption of the MEC environment. To do this, considering power consumption behavior of MEC servers using CPUs with dynamic voltage frequency scaling, we propose a power-efficient clustering scheme (PECS) that minimizes power consumption of MEC servers by obtaining the optimal number of clusters through convex optimization. Numerical results reveal the proposed PECS reduces power consumption of the MEC environment by 12.32% relative to an existing scheme while sustaining average delay of inflows processed in MEC servers at the acceptable level without turning off MEC servers."

In this work, we present a design pattern, named Self-organising Coordination Regions (SCR), which aims to support scalable monitoring and control in distributed systems. Specifically, it is a decentralised coordination pattern for partitioned orchestration of devices (typically on a spatial basis), which provides adaptivity, resilience, and distributed decision-making in large-scale situated systems. It works through a self-organising construction of regions of space, where internal coordination activities are regulated via feedback/control flows among leaders and worker nodes. We present the pattern, provide a template implementation in the Aggregate Computing framework, and evaluate it through simulation of a case study in Edge Computing."

In this regard, driver assistance and autonomous driving technology are gaining more attention. Such technology has the potential to reduce road accidents, traffic congestion, and fuel usage. However, vehicles cannot become fully autonomous, until they are able to sense their context efficiently (context sensing), and to use ambient learning to respond appropriately and within short timescales to the data they have sensed. Context sharing will also become essential, because a single vehicle will not be able to gain a holistic view of its context without cooperation from other nearby vehicles and from the roadside infrastructure. Indeed, there are further advantages when a group of vehicles make intelligent decisions based on a common understanding of their context. This chapter highlights the significance of ambient intelligence for next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles, describes its current state of the art, and also shows how its potential might be achieved. One of the main challenges refers to how to provision and coordinate cloud-based services to meet the needs of real-time (low latency) data-intensive (high data rate) ambient intelligence, particularly for safety-critical vehicular safety applications. It indicates how autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles are likely to make seamless use of any available wireless networking technologies to improve both coverage and reliability and, where feasible, to cache critical content near the network edge so as to minimize the number of network hops and hence service latencies. Both of these approaches should improve the network quality of service afforded to driving applications."

Indeed, the 5G system aims to respond to a wide range of services including Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and, therefore, vehicular communications. However, the current Cooperative-Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) architecture does not meet the key design recommendations of the 5G architecture design. Thus, this integration is not possible yet. Indeed, five different improvements should be considered to make it possible: network intelligence and automation, edge data processing and interoperability, network control, environment virtualization and finally security and privacy. Different papers have already proposed architectures enabling some of these improvements through the integration of different technologies in the C-ITS architecture. To highlight their strengths and their limits, these states-of-the-art solutions are compared. None of them propose a solution meeting the five identified improvements. That is why this paper presents a new architecture taking all these improvements into account. In particular, to complete the existing work, automation, security, privacy and trust are considered. To do so, a knowledge plane enhancing the functioning of the whole architecture is designed. Moreover, a security and privacy plane, strengthening trust in the vehicular environment thanks to Blockchain, is proposed. The role of the different components of this four-plane architecture is also described. Finally, some of the main challenges of the deployment of the proposed architecture are discussed."

At the same time, the low-latency, high-span service is becoming a necessity of today’s devices. To accomplish the future demand, large-scale network adaptation requires next-generation cellular infrastructure, known as fifth generation (5G). In this chapter, we discuss how these requirements can be achieved over the next 10 years. We have covered the techniques that we presume to have a good possibility of being adopted in next-generation 5G networks. The proposed technology has been described in several texts and accepted in many technical recommendation reports. It is observed that large-capacity growth can only be possible with major architectural adoption in cellular and wireless network technology.

Moreover, we discuss the links between flexibility and reconfigurability, on the one side, and context awareness and content awareness, on the other; we show how two of the building blocks of the Flex5Gware architecture, namely on-the-fly MAC reconfiguration and dynamic multi-cell coordinated resource scheduling, can leverage context and content information to make reconfiguration decisions. Our evaluation, conducted by both prototyping and simulation, show that this brings significant benefits in terms of improved coexistence of heterogeneous access networks and reduced latency. We terminate our paper by discussing how the Flex5Gware architecture aims at influencing future system standardization and leveraging the benefits of some key 5G networking enablers described in the paper."

In edge-cloud computing, a set of servers are deployed near the mobile devices such that these devices can offload tasks to the servers with low latency. Most existing works usually focus on offloading tasks under the premise that sufficient resources are owned by edge servers while ignoring budget constraint of user. If failed to consider about this, the existing offloading schemes may cause user to overspend, this is unacceptable to user. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the task offloading problem in edge-cloud computing aiming to minimize the task duration while tasks are generated by user with constrainted budget. Besides edge servers are equipped with limited computation and storage resources. Specifically, the problem we formulate is an NP-hard problem. In order to solve it, we propose a heuristic strategy. The simulation results prove that the proposed scheme can improve the success ratio and reduce the task duration, compared to random and greedy offloading schemes."

We believe Spellbound is a form of digital outdoor gaming that anchors enjoyment on physical action, social interaction, and tangible feedback.

Hence, this paper aims to identify the open challenges in cloud-based CDNs. In this regard, we present an overview of cloud-based CDN followed by a detailed discussion on open challenges and research dimensions. We present a state-of-the-art survey on current commercial and research/academic CCDNs. Finally, we present a comprehensive analysis of current CCDNs against the identified research dimensions."

This real-world physicality makes the experience fun for game players, yet it brings the unique challenge of creating and orchestrating such a game. That is, location-based games are often difficult to create, grow, and maintain over long periods of time. Our research investigates how location-based games can be designed to overcome this challenge of scalability. We studied the well-established location-based game of Geocaching through active participation and an online survey to better understand how it has succeeded in maintaining user involvement and growth over the last decade. Findings show that Geocaching benefits by having players directly create game content, including both lightweight and elaborate creations. Geocaching has also made it simple for players to perform game orchestration by monitoring game content, other players, and even non-players. We then characterize location-based games according to various attributes and suggest how the lessons learned from Geocaching could be applied more generally to the design of other location-based games and in which cases they should not be applied."

In such distributed environments, service providers will typically face tens, hundreds, or thousands of compute location candidates (edge, regional, and central) where network service components can be placed. To take optimized placement decisions of network services and execute the management workflows, orchestration systems require up-to-date and accurate resource availability representation, in the form of a network inventory that can be immense in distributed cloud scenarios. As a result, the service management and placement problems may become not tractable. In this work, we propose the Abstracted Network Inventory (ANI) component to generate service-optimized network views over the same network inventory. ANI implements a novel abstraction method where network service requirements are used as an input to generate an optimized abstract network inventory representation, called Logical Network Inventory (LNI). We also provide a formal definition of the network model and problem statement along with the development of three algorithms to efficiently build an LNI. Results show the potential benefits of using an LNI to streamline service management and placement: (i) the relationship between compute nodes and links (i.e., density) in an LNI is reduced between 1.8-2.7x compared to a full network inventory topology; and (ii) up to 50% of time can be saved for service placement after abstracting around 20% of the compute nodes."

In this paper, a blockchain and federated learning-enabled predicted edge-resource allocation (FLP-RA) algorithm is introduced to manage the allocation of computing resources in B5G networks. It allows for smart edge nodes to train their local data and share it with other nodes to create a global estimation of future network loads. As such, nodes are able to make accurate decisions to distribute the available resources to provide the lowest computing delay."

The most widely used Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) is OpenStack, which is responsible for managing compute, storage and virtual network resources. As the current scheduler of OpenStack does not take into account the underlying physical network characteristics, in order to deploy network services (NS) in a geographically distributed infrastructure, multiple VIMs and an orchestrator on top of them, are necessary for resource management. In contrast to today's setups we show a novel solution that merges these functionalities under one common OpenStack domain: our solution is capable of i) measuring the bandwidth and delay characteristics of the underlying physical network among compute nodes, ii) creating a topology model that contains both compute-, and network-related features, iii) mapping the incoming service requests, and re-mapping already deployed services to the underlying resources with our novel orchestration algorithm, iv) deploying and migrating services via OpenStack API calls."

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of orchestrating virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity. Moreover, we observe significant gains when deploying a small number of mmWave links that complement the Wire physical infrastructure in high node density networks."

Common orchestration solutions make placement decisions based only on the resources of the underlying network and the application resource requests; however, using the profiles of applications to make placement decisions has the potential to enhance the final performance perceived by the end-users. This paper proposes the use of application profiles according to their popularity to guide their placement. To corroborate the effectiveness of the use of the profiles, two placement mechanisms are presented, one based on Genetic Algorithm and the other inspired on graph partitions. Simulation results show that it is possible to reduce the latency and jitter of applications via a service placement guided by the profiles. The mechanism based on graph partitions showed better results for all scenarios, followed closely by the Genetic Algorithm in the scenarios with lower load."

Emerging AR/VR services put even more pressure on current network infrastructures, calling for considerable advancements toward fully cloud-native architectures.

One approach to support emerging use cases such as, e.g., virtual reality and in-network image processing is to introduce virtualized network functions (vNF)s at the edge of the network, placed in close proximity to the end users to reduce end-to-end latency, time-to-response, and unnecessary utilisation in the core network. While placement of vNFs has been studied before, it has so far mostly focused on reducing the utilisation of server resources (i.e., minimising the number of servers required in the network to run a specific set of vNFs), and not taking network conditions into consideration such as, e.g., end-to-end latency, the constantly changing network dynamics, or user mobility patterns. In this paper, we formulate the Edge vNF placement problem to allocate vNFs to a distributed edge infrastructure, minimising end-to-end latency from all users to their associated vNFs. We present a way to dynamically re-schedule the optimal placement of vNFs based on temporal network-wide latency fluctuations using optimal stopping theory. We then evaluate our dynamic scheduler over a simulated nation-wide backbone network using real-world ISP latency characteristics. We show that our proposed dynamic placement scheduler minimises vNF migrations compared to other schedulers (e.g., periodic and always-on scheduling of a new placement), and offers Quality of Service guarantees by not exceeding a maximum number of latency violations that can be tolerated by certain applications."

The primary goal of our cooperative game approach is to find optimal control decisions toward the appropriate system operation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of several performance criteria from the numerical simulations. Experimental results show that we can achieve a mutually desirable solution with a good system performance balance while enhancing the resource efficiency better than the existing cloud-edge control protocols."

We argue that the large-scale performance and feasibility of the proposals can only be evaluated with complete prototypes, including all relevant components. Therefore, we implemented fully-fledged solutions and conducted large-scale experiments to reveal the scalability characteristics of both approaches. We found that our VIM extension can be a valid option for single-provider setups encompassing even 100 edge domains (Points of Presence equipped with multiple servers) and serving a few hundreds of customers.

Accordingly, we minimize a sum of intertwined costs including the energy consumption, latency and accuracy loss of multiple MDs, while satisfying the maximum latency constraint and the minimum accuracy constraint of each MAR application. With rigorous analysis, we design a theoretical framework for the optimization of MD performance by jointly managing the frame resolution of the image to offload to the MEC server from MDs, and the computation capacity distribution over MDs in the case of the limited computation capacity of the MEC server. Our numerical analysis validates that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the number of service-level agreement violations, such as exceeding the maximum latency constraint, compared with the existed algorithm.

We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization.

The success of the edge computing networking paradigm depends on the proper orchestration of the edge servers. Several Edge applications and services are intolerant to latency, especially in 5G and beyond networks, such as intelligent video surveillance, E-health, Internet of Vehicles, and augmented reality applications. The edge devices underwent rapid growth in both capabilities and size to cope with the service demands. Orchestrating it on the cloud was a prominent trend during the past decade. However, the increasing number of edge devices poses a significant burden on the orchestration delay. In addition to the growth in edge devices, the high mobility of users renders traditional orchestration schemes impractical for contemporary edge networks. Proper segmentation of the edge space becomes necessary to adapt these schemes to address these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a segmentation technique employing lax clustering and segregated mobility-based clustering. We then apply latency mapping to these clusters. The proposed scheme’s main objective is to create subspaces (segments) that enable light and efficient edge orchestration by-reducing the processing time and the core cloud communication overhead. A bench-marking simulation is conducted with the results showing decreased mobility-related failures and reduced orchestration delay."

Many edge applications, such as multi-player augmented reality (AR) gaming and federated machine learning, require that distributed clients work collaboratively for a common goal through message exchanges. Given an edge network, it is an open problem how to deploy such collaborative edge applications to achieve the best overall system performance. This paper presents a formal study of this problem. We first provide a mix of cost models to capture the system. Based on a thorough formulation, we propose an iterative algorithm dubbed ITEM, where in each iteration, we construct a graph to encode all the costs and convert the cost optimization problem into a graph cut problem. By obtaining the minimum $s-t$ cut via existing max-flow algorithms, we address the original problem via solving a series of graph cuts. We rigorously prove that ITEM has a parameterized constant approximation ratio. Inspired by the optimal stopping theory, we further design an online algorithm called OPTS, based on optimally alternating between partial and full placement updates. Our evaluations with real-world data traces demonstrate that ITEM performs close to the optimum (within 5%) and converges fast. OPTS achieves a bounded performance as expected while reducing full updates by more than 67% of the time."

Edge computing promises to exploit these underlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive applications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key missing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned, unmanaged devices into a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the heterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability of such devices. In this paper we propose an orchestration framework IBDASH , which orchestrates application tasks on an edge system that comprises a mix of commercial and personal edge devices. IBDASH targets reducing both end-to-end latency of execution and probability of failure for applications that have dependency among tasks, captured by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). IBDASH takes memory constraints of each edge device and network bandwidth into consideration. To assess the effectiveness of IBDASH , we run real application tasks on real edge devices with widely varying capabilities. We feed these measurements into a simulator that runs IBDASH at scale. Compared to three state-of-the-art edge orchestration schemes and two intuitive baselines, IBDASH reduces the end-to-end latency and probability of failure, by 14% and 41% on average respectively. The main takeaway from our work is that it is feasible to combine personal and commercial devices into a usable edge computing platform, one that delivers low and predictable latency and high availability."

When running on top of geographically dispersed edge clouds, fully unleashing the benefits of service function chaining is, however, by no means trivial. In this paper, we propose an online orchestration framework for cross-edge service function chaining, which aims to maximize the holistic cost efficiency, via jointly optimizing the resource provisioning and traffic routing on-the-fly. This long-term cost minimization problem is difficult since it is NP-hard and involves future uncertain information. To simultaneously address these dual challenges, we carefully combine an online optimization technique with an approximate optimization method in a joint optimization framework, through: 1) decomposing the long-term problem into a series of one-shot fractional problem with a regularization technique and 2) rounding the fractional solution to a near-optimal integral solution with a randomized dependent scheme that preserves the solution feasibility. The resulting online algorithm achieves an outstanding performance guarantee, as verified by both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations."

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network-periphery, in proximity to end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in MEC-enabled multi-cell networks with multidimensional (storage-computation-communication) constraints.

Time-critical applications and services are real-time software whose failure could result in catastrophic consequences such as fatalities, damage to property, even financial losses. Edge computing is the main enabler of 5G ultra-low latency use cases. Edge resources are limited compared to the abundant cloud computing resources. As such, provisioning time-critical applications at the edge is more challenging and demanding. Even though virtual network function (VNF) sharing improves the utilization of the service providers’ resources, service requests -including time-critical ones- can still be rejected due to insufficient resources. This paper proposes IPTSV, an immediate placement scheme for time-critical services with VNF sharing. The proposed scheme prioritizes time-critical premium (Pr) services over best-effort (BE) services. In cases when no resources are available for Pr services, a preemption mechanism preempts resources for the Pr service, by deporting one or more deployed BE services. The experimental results show that IPTSV can reduce the Pr services rejection rate to $\sim 0\%$, while minimizing the disturbance that BE services might witness such as prolonged waiting and turnaround times."

In this regard, the dynamic items should be refreshed to the newest versions timely, when cached at the network edge. The state-of-the-art content placement methods mostly target on static items, and cache the popular items with priority to maximize the local hit rate. However, popular content items may have higher dynamics and require frequent cache refresh, which consumes more transmissions and degrades the system efficiency. In this work, we revisit the content placement problem at mobile edge, where the content dynamics and popularity are jointly considered when choosing items to cache. To this end, the effective hit rate of an cached content item is derived with respect to the corresponding request rate (i.e., popularity) and version update rate (i.e., dynamics). Specifically, the effective hit rate is proved to increase with the request arrival rate in an convex manner and decrease with the version update rate. Then, the popularity- and-lifetime-aware placement (PALAP) scheme is proposed to maximize the overall effective hit rate of the local cache when providing dynamic content services. Extensive simulations are conducted on OMNeT++ platform to validate the obtained analytical results. In addition, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can double the cache hit rate compared with the conventional most-popular-first placement (MPFP) scheme, if the content requests are less concentrated. Accordingly, the average service delay can be reduced effectively, especially when the system is heavily loaded."

In particular, network slicing allows network operators (NOs) to divide the available network resources into multiple logical network slices (NSs) for providing dedicated virtual networks tailored to the specific service/business requirements. MEC enables NOs to provide diverse ultra-low latency services for supporting the needs of different industry verticals by moving computing facilities to the network edge. An NS can be constructed/deployed by instantiating a set of virtual network functions (VNFs) on top of MEC cloud servers for provisioning diverse latency-sensitive/time-critical communication services (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality) on demand at a lesser cost and time. However, VNFs, MEC cloud servers, and communication links are subject to failures due to software bugs, misconfiguration, overloading, hardware faults, cyber attacks, power outage, and natural/man-made disaster. Failure of a critical network component disrupts services abruptly and leads to users’ dissatisfaction, which may result in revenue loss for the NOs. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-connectivity in 5G networks to tackle this problem and our proposed approach is resilient against i) failure of VNFs, ii) failure of local servers within MEC, iii) failure of communication links, and iv) failure of an entire MEC cloud facility in regional level. To this end, we formulate the problem as a binary integer programming (BIP) model in order to optimally deploy NSs with the minimum cost, and prove it is NP-hard. Since the exact optimal solution for the NP-hard problem cannot be efficiently computed in polynomial time, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm based heuristic to obtain near-optimal solution in polynomial time. By extensive simulations, we show that our proposed approach not only reduces resource wastage, but also improves throughput while providing high resiliency against failures."

Prior research significantly focused on offloading tasks from terminals to edge servers, yet most ignored how to store task's necessary data (such as databases and pretrained machine‐learning models) on edge servers. Today, as data‐intensive tasks such as deep learning and augmented reality become common, large data storage and powerful computation resources are needed. This is a cumbersome challenge, because many lightweight edge servers have limited resources. If an edge server does not have a task's necessary data, then it needs to offload the task to cloud datacenters or download the necessary data from the cloud. Either case could increase data processing latency. To address this problem, this paper proposes an edge‐side collaborative storage framework called Edge‐side Cooperative Storage (ECS). In ECS, edge servers collaboratively store and process data‐intensive tasks's necessary data. Here, we particularly focus on how to effectively place data on ECS, using an approach that differs from existing works (that model data placement problems as linear/integer programming problems). Our work models cooperative storage as a graph and solves the data placement problem by using a graph‐based iterative algorithm. This algorithm easily extends to a distributed version, so distributed ECSworks efficiently without a centralized scheduler. We also evaluate ECS's effectiveness and convergence through simulations. Simulation results show that ECSis 2× better than a traditional nonshared storage framework in terms of the cache hit rate."

Moreover, 5G enables billions of devices to transfer an unprecedented amount of data at the same time. This transformation calls for novel technologies like multi-access edge computing (MEC) to satisfy the stringent latency and bitrate requirements of the mentioned applications. The main challenge pertaining to MEC is that the edge MEC nodes are usually characterized by scarce computational resources compared to the core or cloud, arising the challenge of efficiently utilizing the edge resources while ensuring that the service requirements are satisfied. When considered with the users’ mobility, this poses another challenge, which lies in minimization of the service interruption for the users whose service requests are represented as service function chains (SFCs) composed of virtualized network functions (VNFs) instantiated on the MEC nodes or on the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of joint user association, SFC placement, and resource allocation, employing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The objective functions of this MILP-based problem formulation are to minimize (i) the service provisioning cost, (ii) the transport network utilization, and (iii) the service interruption. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle the scalability issue of the MILP-based algorithms.

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network edge, in proximity to the end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be pre-stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in dense MEC networks with multidimensional constraints. We show that this problem generalizes several well-known placement and routing problems and propose an algorithm that achieves close-to-optimal performance using a randomized rounding technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize available storage, computation, and communication resources to maximize the number of requests served by low-latency edge cloud servers."

The applications of Augmented Reality (AR) have received great attention from academics and operators. However, the complex computing required for AR applications has caused service operators to face the problems of poor user experience due to insufficient computing resources. Network function virtualization (NFV) enables operators to directly establish network functions on virtual machines and can flexibly adjust the number of each virtual network function (VNF) according to users’ requirements. Thus, the system can reduce unnecessary waste of resources. In addition, we use multi-access edge computing (MEC) to provide computing resources. The edge server is close to users and reduces transmission cost of the system. This paper proposes an MEC-based VNF placement and scheduling scheme for AR applications. Considering the functional topology of AR applications, the compute-intensive application can provide good service quality for a large number of users within limited resources. The simulation shows that the proposed method can maintain good service quality as the number of user requests increases."

As a contribution, we propose a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of novel and sustainable technologies (e.g., D2D communication, Massive MIMO, SDN, and NFV) and has major features such as scalability, reliability, and ultra-low latency support.

Provisioning reliable network services for users is the top priority of most network service providers, as unreliable services or severe service failures can result in tremendous losses of users, particularly for their mission-critical applications. In this paper, we study reliability-aware VNF instances provisioning in an MEC, where different users request different network services with different reliability requirements through paying their requested services with the aim to maximize the network throughput. To this end, we first formulate a novel reliability-aware VNF instance placement problem by provisioning primary and secondary VNF instances at different cloudlets in MEC for each user while meeting the specified reliability requirement of the user request. We then show that the problem is NP-hard and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we instead devise an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio for the problem. Moreover, we also consider two special cases of the problem. For one special case where each request only requests one primary and one secondary VNF instances, the problem is still NP-hard, and we devise a constant approximation algorithm for it. For another special case where different VNFs have the same amounts of computing resource demands, we show that it is polynomial-time solvable by developing a dynamic programming solution for it. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising, and the empirical results of the algorithms outperform their analytical counterparts as theoretical estimations usually are very conservative."

With multiple possible computation centers, the “where” and when” of solving these requests becomes paramount when meeting user deadlines. We formulate the problem of meeting users’ deadlines while minimizing the total cost to the edge-to-cloud service provider as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. We show the NP-hardness of this problem, and propose two heuristics based on making decisions on a local vs global scale. We vary the user numbers, the QoS constraint, and the cost difference between a remote cloud and cloudlets(edge clouds), and run multiple Monte-Carlo runs for each case.

This technology not only minimizes the end-to-end latency but also increases the efficiency of computing. Some latency-sensitive applications, such as cloud video, online game, and augmented reality, take advantage of the MEC system to provide fast and stable services. Several new network techniques, including the implementation of NFV (Network Function Virtualization), the placement of VNF (Virtual Network Function) and the scheduling of SFC (Service Function Chain), should be considered to be applied in the MEC system. In this paper, we focus on the research about the scheduling of SFC in the NFV enabled MEC system and propose a solution accordingly. First, we make reasonable assumptions on the settings of MEC systems and model the SFC scheduling problem into a flexible job-shop scheduling problem. Since minimizing the latency can significantly improve the quality of service (QoS) and increase the revenue of Internet Service Providers, our optimization goal is to minimize the overall scheduling latency. To solve this optimization problem, a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm DQS is proposed. DQS can detect the variation of the MEC system’s environment and perform adaptive scheduling for SFC requests. As the results of the simulation indicate, DQS works better than the other off-the-shelf algorithms in two key indexes: overall scheduling latency and average resource usage. Moreover, DQS can shorten the decision time and schedule SFCs stably with high performance. It is suitable to be extended to an online scheduling algorithm."

This centralized approach has limited ability to support real-time analysis of large-scale streaming data due to network bandwidth and latency constraints between data source and cloud. We propose RealEdgeStream (RES) an edge enhanced stream analytics system for large-scale, high performance data analytics. The proposed approach investigates the problem of video stream analytics by proposing (i) filtration and (ii) identification phases. The filtration phase reduces the amount of data by filtering low-value stream objects using configurable rules. The identification phase uses deep learning inference to perform analytics on the streams of interest. The phases consist of stages which are mapped onto available in-transit and cloud resources using a placement algorithm to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints identified by a user.

However, the most popular container orchestration tools, e.g., Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, do not take into account the locality aspect during deployment, resulting in poor location choices at the edge of the network. In this paper, we propose an edge deployment strategy to tackle the lack of locality awareness of the container orchestrator. In this strategy, the orchestrator collects information about latency and the real-time resource consumption from the current container deployments, providing a bird's-eye view of the most demanded locations and the best places for deployment to cover the largest number of clients.

The main objective is proposed to ensure the quality of experience (QoE) of users, which is also yet to be studied extensively. A utility function modeling user perception of service latency is used to evaluate QoE. We formulate the problem of service provisioning in MEC as an Integer Nonlinear Programming (INLP), aiming at maximizing the total utility of all users.

To make EC pervasive, the following challenges must be tackled: how to satisfy the growing demand for edge computing facilities, how to discover the nearby edge servers, and how to securely access them? In this paper, we present ExEC, an open framework where edge providers can offer their capacity and be discovered by application providers and end-users. ExEC aims at the unification of interaction between edge and cloud providers so that cloud providers can utilize services of third-party edge providers, and any willing entity can easily become an edge provider. In ExEC, the unfolding of initially cloud-deployed application towards edge happens without administrative intervention, since ExEC discovers available edge providers on the fly and monitors incoming end-user traffic, determining the near-optimal placement of edge services. ExEC is a set of loosely coupled components and common practices, allowing for custom implementations needed to embrace the diverse needs of specific EC scenarios. ExEC leverages only existing protocols and requires no modifications to the deployed infrastructure. Using real-world topology data and experiments on cloud platforms, we demonstrate the feasibility of ExEC and present results on its expected performance."

Edge Computing (EC) is a promising approach to address the requirements set by upcoming industrial systems. However, the combination of distributed edge network and multiple mobile devices gives rise to the need for live migration. Migration of multiple services in parallel demands for an intelligent allocation of network resources. This paper describes a dynamic algorithm to perform smart allocation of resources for live migration on demand. In addition to maintaining the Quality of Service requirements of the end devices, it also maintains the network overhead due to live migration low. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using a discrete-event network simulator."

To address this, mobile edge-cloud (MEC) has been proposed as an approach to bring resources closer to users. Recently, in contrast to conventional fixed cloud locations, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has, with some added cost due to the necessary decentralization, enhanced MEC with new flexibility in placing MEC services to any nodes capable of virtualizing their resources. In this work, we address the question on how to optimally place resources among NFV-enabled nodes to support mobile multimedia applications with low latency requirement and when to adapt the current resource placements to address workload changes. We first show that the placement optimization problem is NP-hard and propose an online dynamic resource allocation scheme that consists of an adaptive greedy heuristic algorithm and a detection mechanism to identify the time when the system will no longer be able to satisfy the applications' delay requirement. Our scheme takes into account the effect of current existing techniques (i.e., auto-scaling and load balancing). We design and implement a realistic NFV-enabled MEC simulated framework and show through extensive simulations that our proposal always manages to allocate sufficient resources on time to guarantee continuous satisfaction of the application latency requirements under changing workload while incurring up to 40% less cost in comparison to existing overprovisioning approaches."

Proposed applications include high-definition, low-latency video streaming, remote surgery, as well as applications for tactile Internet, virtual or augmented reality that demand network side data processing (such as image recognition, transformation or head/eye motion aware rendering). One approach to support these use cases is to introduce virtualized network services at the edge of the network, in close proximity of the end users to reduce end-to-end latency, time-to-response and unnecessary utilization of the core network, while providing flexibility for resource allocation. While many research projects including our previous work on Glasgow Network Functions have proposed running virtual network functions (vNF)s at the network edge, a latency-optimal placement allocation has not been presented before for the network edge and therefore the impact on user-to-vNF latency has not been investigated.In this paper, we formulate a simple vNF placement problem that minimizes end-to-end latency from users to their network functions. We have implemented the problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with the Gurobi solver, and evaluated it with a real topology of a network provider. We use our solution to compare two vNF deployment scenarios over an emulation of a national backbone network: a two-tier edge deployment and a cloud-only deployment. We show that, in our example, using edge servers can deliver up to 70% improvement in user-to-vNF latency."

To cope with this issue, we propose MEO with fuzzy-based logic that splits tasks from mobile devices and maps them onto the cloud and edge servers to reduce the latency of handling these tasks and task failures. A fuzzy-based MEO handles the multi-criteria decision-making process to decide where the offloaded task should run by considering multiple parameters in the same framework. Our approach selects the appropriate host for task execution and finds the optimal task-splitting strategy. Compared to the existing approaches, the service time using our proposal can achieve up to 7.6%, 22.6%, 38.9%, and 51.8% performance gains for augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications, respectively."

Existing research works have paid lots of attention to how to offload computation tasks from terminals to edge servers, but most of them ignored how to store tasks' necessary data like pretrained models or databases on edge servers. Recently, the data-intensive tasks like deep learning and augmented reality are becoming common, which need large data storages and powerful computation resources. This leads to a cumbersome challenge, since many lightweight edge servers have limited resources. If an edge server does not have a task's necessary data, it needs to offload the task to cloud data centers or download the necessary data from the cloud. Both cases could increase the data processing latency. To address this problem, this paper proposes an edge-side collaborative storage framework (ECS). In ECS, the edge servers collaboratively store and process data-intensive tasks' necessary data. Particularly, if an edge server does not have the necessary data, it will forward the task to the nearest servers that contain the data. An effective iterative data placement algorithm is also proposed to improve ECS's performance. The experimental results show that ECS is 2 x better than the traditional non-shared storage framework in terms of the cache hit rate."

Currently, by matching the characteristics of incoming Internet of Things (IoT) applications to the current state of computing and networking resources, a mobile edge orchestrator (MEO) provides high-quality service while temporally and spatially changing the incoming workload. Moreover, a fuzzy-based MEO is used to handle the multicriteria decision-making process by considering multiple parameters within the same framework in order to make an offloading decision for an incoming task of an IoT application. In a fuzzy-based MEO, the fuzzy-based offloading strategy leads to unbalanced loads among edge servers. Therefore, the fuzzy-based MEO needs to scale its capacity when it comes to a large number of devices in order to avoid task failures and to reduce service times. In this paper, we investigate and propose an online workload balancing algorithm, which we call the fuzzy-based (FuB) algorithm, for a fuzzy-based MEO. By considering user configuration requirements, server geographic locations, and available resource capacities for achieving an online algorithm, our proposal allocates the proximate server for each incoming task in real time at the MEO. A simulation was conducted in augmented reality, healthcare, compute-intensive, and infotainment applications. Compared to two benchmark schemes that use the fuzzy logic approach for an MEO in IoT environments, the simulation results (using EdgeCloudSim) show that our proposal outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of service time, the number of failed tasks, and processing times when the system is overloaded."

To evaluate an augmented reality (AR) system in combination with a 1.5-T closed-bore magnetic resonance (MR) imager as a navigation tool for needle biopsies.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The experimental protocol had institutional animal care and use committee approval. Seventy biopsies were performed in phantoms by using 20 tube targets, each with a diameter of 6 mm, and 50 virtual targets. The position of the needle tip in AR and MR space was compared in multiple imaging planes, and virtual and real needle tip localization errors were calculated. Ten AR-guided biopsies were performed in three pigs, and the duration of each procedure was determined. After successful puncture, the distance to the target was measured on MR images. The confidence limits for the achieved in-plane hit rate and for lateral deviation were calculated. A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine whether the placement error in a particular dimension (x, y, or z) differed from the others.


RESULTS
For the 50 virtual targets, a mean error of 1.1 mm +/- 0.5 (standard deviation) was calculated. A repeated measures analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant difference (P > .99) in the errors in any particular orientation. For the real targets, all punctures were inside the 6-mm-diameter tube in the transverse plane. The needle depth was within the target plane in 11 biopsy procedures; the mean distance to the center of the target was 2.55 mm (95% confidence interval: 1.77 mm, 3.34 mm). For nine biopsy procedures, the needle tip was outside the target plane, with a mean distance to the edge of the target plane of 1.5 mm (range, 0.07-3.46 mm). In the animal experiments, the puncture was successful in all 10 cases, with a mean target-needle distance of 9.6 mm +/- 4.85. The average procedure time was 18 minutes per puncture.


CONCLUSION
Biopsy procedures performed with a combination of a closed-bore MR system and an AR system are feasible and accurate."

Since many such mobile applications are computation-intensive, mobile edge computing (MEC), a promising computing paradigm that can provide on-demand computation resources (i.e., virtual machines (VMs)), is considered to adopt for allowing MUs to offload their computation tasks to EgSvrs in the proximity. Previous works have developed many schemes to schedule computation tasks to be offloaded to edge servers (EgSvrs). However, these developed schemes are centralized, which are vulnerable to congested coordination operations, and have no trustworthiness guarantee as well. In this paper, we propose to design a decentralized coordination scheme to orchestrate MUs and EgSvrs for scheduling computation tasks to their right VMs by taking advantage of blockchain technology. Specifically, we develop an efficient task-VM matching algorithm that jointly considers task execution time and energy consumption. Particularly, we prove the stability of the task-VM matching achieved by the developed matching algorithm. Besides, we further implement the developed task-VM matching algorithm on the blockchain by developing a smart matching contract to perform task-VM matching on the blockchain without trusted third parties. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our decentralized coordination scheme can improve the performance significantly and converge to a stable state very quickly."

Such new standards must be capable of serving large number of devices, especially mobile and wearable devices, with the best quality-of-experience (QoE) possible including highly crowded areas. The 5G standard, which is not just an extension to 4G, has emerged as a viable solution to fulfill the aforementioned needs. In this context, 5G promises a paradigm shift, in telecommunication systems and services, by focusing not only on providing high-speed connections with higher data rates, but also in serving large number of devices/users while maintaining high QoE. 5G is regarded as capable of satisfying the resource requirements for the emerging mobile applications such as virtual and augmented reality, vehicular networks (VANETs), and the internet-of-things (IoT) applications. 5G will support emerging communications including machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with low cost, low latency, high bandwidth, and energy efficiency. The deployment of 5G-based systems, which is expected to be available by 2020, will require the integration of multiple new technologies to achieve its goals. Such technologies include Mobile Edge Comping (MEC), wireless virtualization, and software defined systems or networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) among others. In addition, methodologies for resource manipulation and sensing as well as allocation for optimized performance so that QoE of the end-users is maximized. Due to the nonlinearity of the QoE model, the resource manipulation with solution provision within the context of SDN for MEC devices should be solved concurrently so that the associated performance can be assessed and evaluated. The inclusion of MEC, SDN, and NFV, and its possible support for 5G systems is emerging as one of the highly active research areas with a large room for improvements. One specific aspect of great importance is the continuously increasing processing, caching, and storage capabilities required by the emerging applications such as IoT and virtual reality. Considering the aforementioned needs, we arranged a special issue in European Transactions on Telecommunications (ETT). In response to the call for contribution of this special issue, we received 19 paper submissions. After a careful review process, 11 outstanding papers were selected for this special section. The first article is entitled “EdgePlace: Availability-aware Placement for Chained Mobile Edge Applications,” co-authored by Zhu, He and Huang, Changcheng. The authors proposed a novel model to track the availability and cost impact from placement policy changes of the mobile edge applications. The authors formulated their model as a stochastic programming problem. To minimize the complexity challenge, they also propose a heuristic algorithm called EdgePlace. The second article is entitled “A Collaborative Mobile Edge Computing and User Solution for Service Composition in 5G Systems,” co-authored by Al Ridhawi, Ismaeel; Aloqaily, Moayad; Kotb, Yehia; Al Ridhawi, Yousif; and Jararweh, Yaser. The authors envision a real-time context-aware service-composition collaborative framework that lies at the edge of the network, comprising MEC and user devices for fast composite service delivery. The proposed solution decomposes cloud data into a set of files and services, which are then replicated to MEC nodes. The third article is entitled “Sub-Carriers Assignment Scheme for Multiple Secondary Users in OFDMA Based IEEE 802.22 WRAN: A Game Theoretic Approach,” co-authored by Gupta, Nitin; Dhurandher, Sanjay; and Woungang, Isaac. The paper developed a suboptimal algorithm in which initially optimal number of subcarriers are found considering the equal power distribution. The problem is formulated as an oligopoly market competition and a noncooperative Cournot game is used in which different unlicensed secondary users (SUs) compete for the number of subcarriers based upon the data rate they are getting from current channel condition. The fair distribution of subcarriers is ensured by finding the Nash equilibrium.

We tackle the edge cloud network design problem for mobile access networks. The model is such that the virtual machines (VMs) are associated with mobile users and are allocated to cloudlets. Designing an edge cloud network implies first determining where to install cloudlet facilities among the available sites, then assigning sets of access points, such as base stations to cloudlets, while supporting VM orchestration and considering partial user mobility information, as well as the satisfaction of service-level agreements. We present link-path formulations supported by heuristics to compute solutions in reasonable time. We qualify the advantage in considering mobility for both users and VMs as up to 20% less users not satisfied in their SLA with a little increase of opened facilities. We compare two VM mobility modes, bulk and live migration, as a function of mobile cloud service requirements, determining that a high preference should be given to live migration, while bulk migrations seem to be a feasible alternative on delay-stringent tiny-disk services, such as augmented reality support, and only with further relaxation on network constraints."

Specifically, this research explores the use of ET hardware and software in real-world contexts to analyze how visual attention is impacted by location and proximity to geometric edges, as well as elements of contrast, intensity against context, and facial features. Researchers also used data visualization and interpretation tools in augmented reality environments to anticipate human responses to alternative placement and design. Results show that ET methods, supported by the screen-based and wearable eye-tracking technologies, can provide results that are consistent with previous research of signage performance using static images in terms of cognitive load and legibility, and ET technologies offer an advanced dynamic tool for the design and placement of signage."

To this end, it is necessary to understand how mobile network latency changes over time during a session with different carriers and how the server placement affects the latencies. In this paper, we present results from a measurement study of mobile network latency and jitter in 4G networks of Hong Kong and Helsinki, two very different cities in terms of population density and mobile infrastructure. Based on the results, we introduce a lightweight carrier selection algorithm that displays latencies 10 to 20% lower than single carrier operation."

Typical assembly planners assume that parts have nominal shapes, while in reality their geometry varies according to the tolerance specifications. To account for toleranced parts, an assembly plan must be feasible for all possible variations of its components. Despite its practical importance, very few works address this problem. This paper presents a general framework for mechanical assembly planning with toleranced planar parts and shows how to incorporate it into existing planners. Our framework uses a general tolerancing model for parts: vertices are standard elementary functions of the part dimensions, which are allowed to vary within tolerance intervals. The relative position of parts is uniquely determined by an assembly graph, which defines constraints between features of neighboring parts. The assembly graph supports placements of parts with rotational degrees of freedom, cyclic relations, and conditional constraints, which occur in non-nominal contacts between edges. Using this framework, we show how to augment existing algorithms for useful motion types, including single and multiple step translations, and infinitesimal rigid motions. We demonstrate the dramatic reduction in the number of valid assembly plans when tolerances are introduced."
