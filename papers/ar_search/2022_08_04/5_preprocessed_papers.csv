Applications and the network control layer on the other hand mainly operate in isolation without direct communication. Recently, increased integration between the network and application has been advocated to benefit both the application and the network but the information exchange has mostly been limited to flow level information. We argue that in the realm of datacenter networks, sharing additional information such as the function processing times and deployment data for planning jobs and tasks can result in major optimization benefits for the network. In this study we present Accord as a Network Application Integration solution to achieve a holistic network-application management solution. We propose a protocol as an API between the network and application then we build a system that uses the processing and networking data from the application to perform network scheduling and routing optimizations. We demonstrate that for a sample distributed learning application, an Accord enhanced solution that uses the application processing information can yield up to 27.8% reduction in Job Completion Time (JCT). In addition, we show how Accord can yield better results for routing decisions through a reinforcement learning algorithm that outperforms first shortest path first by %13.",UCC,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In such multi-domain settings, the collaboration between networks and applications provides opportunities to both applications to improve their performances and network service providers to increase their business offerings. Although many systems are proposed to support such collaborations, they are point or incremental solutions. In this work, we propose the exploration of a more integrated architecture with huge possibilities taking a network-application integration (NAI) approach. Specifically, we explore the NAI possibilities in two concrete aspects: application-aware networking and network-aware applications. We review recent progress in these two aspects, and identify the key barriers in systematically realizing such a deep integration. To address these barriers, we propose a generic multi-domain NAI exposure and discovery framework, called MUDED. Through different systematic analysis and demonstrated prototypes, the MUDED's key components showcase: the maturing of the IETF ALTO protocol on the road to becoming a generic NAI possibilities discovery and exposure mechanism; and the optimized network view generation to simplify the network service placement and management.",2020 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN),2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

As the IoT becoming a major factor in our daily life, provisioning a low response time of the services to IoT users through edge computing is an important problem. Caching necessary program data for the task in an edge node effectively reduces the response time of the computation task. However, due to the increase of IoT users and devices, it is noteworthy that limited-resource edge nodes would receive a number of tasks, having a heavy burden of processing the requests. Therefore, the limited resource and caching space at cloudlet need the careful design of the caching algorithm to utilize the space of multiple edge nodes and relieve the burden of computations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative program caching system that makes different edge nodes cooperatively store program data and cache the replicas of the data requested frequently to handle a number of requests from IoT users. In particular, we develop a cooperative caching algorithm that caches the appropriate number of data replicas depending on the number of requests on each cloudlet and the popularity of the data to minimize the response time. The simulation results show that the proposed cooperative caching algorithm can effectively reduce the response time for IoT users compared to other existing algorithms.",PloS one,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation
