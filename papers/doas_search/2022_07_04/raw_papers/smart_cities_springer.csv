Several international technological organizations have realized the immense potential of autonomous vehicular systems and are currently working towards their complete development for mainstream application. From deep learning algorithms for road object detection to intrusion detection systems for CAN bus monitoring, the functioning of a self-driving vehicle is powered by the simultaneous working of multiple inner vehicle module systems that perform proper vehicle navigation while ensuring the physical safety and digital privacy of the user. Transparency of the vehicle’s thought processes can assure the user of its credibility and reliability. This paper introduces explainable artificial intelligence, which aims to converge the decision-making processes of Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS). Here, the domain of Explainable AI (XAI) provides clear insights into the role of explainable AI in autonomous vehicles and increase human trust for AI based solutions in the same sector. This paper exhibits the trajectories of transportation advancements and the current scenario of the industry. A comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis is performed to compare the simulations of XAI and vehicular smart systems to showcase the significant developments achieved. Visual explanatory methods and an intrusion detection classifier were created as part of this research and achieved significant results over extant works.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-19-1142-2_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The types of commodities and goods mainly determine the right trailer for carrying them. Furthermore, finding the commodities’ flow is an important task for transportation agencies in better planning freight infrastructure investments and initiating near-term traffic throughput improvements. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained deep learning based truck classification system that can detect and classify the trucks, tractors, and trailers following the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) vehicle schema.

This article attempts to improve the traditional prediction model by adopting Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network. ConvLSTM can effectively capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of traffic crashes within road network. It overcomes the shortcoming of the FC-LSTM model that ignores the spatial characteristics of traffic crashes. Therefore, the ConvLSTM model shows excellent performance when predicting traffic crashes. To verify the effectiveness of the ConvLSTM, this study uses historical crash data in the City of Ningbo to train the model and compares the result with that from FC-LSTM. The results show that ConvLSTM has better accuracy and lower loss values. Moreover, the model has higher calculation efficiency. Therefore, the ConvLSTM model is more suitable for predicting traffic crashes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13177-022-00307-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, whether mobility changes are entirely pandemic related has not been investigated for each urban function. This paper evaluates the potential determinants of urban mobility changes for six different urban functions during the COVID-19 pandemic via community mobility data collected by Google. Using artificial neural networks (ANN), the dynamics that affect mobility changes in the following urban functions; grocery/pharmacy, residential, parks, retail/recreation, transport stations, and workplaces, were analysed for Çankaya, one of the densest districts in the capital of Turkey. Results of the prediction model show that responses to the pandemic differed considerably by urban function. Before the new normal era, changes in urban mobility trends were strongly dependent on the pandemic as a public health threat and represented by restrictive government measures. However, impacts of the pandemic on intracity mobility decreased in the new normal era when rules were relaxed. These results are useful for developing proactive policies to ensure rapid post-pandemic recovery in urban economics and planning.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s41685-022-00247-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, most traffic signals cooperate via pre-defined timing phases, which is extremely inefficient in real-time traffic scenarios. Most existing studies on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) traffic signal control have focused on designing efficient communication methods, but have ignored the importance of how agents interact in cooperative communication. To achieve more efficient cooperation among traffic signals and alleviate urban traffic congestion, this study constructs a Graph Cooperation Q-learning Network Traffic Signal Control (GCQN-TSC) model, which is a graph cooperation network with an embedded self-attention mechanism that enables agents to adjust their attention in real time according to the dynamic traffic flow information, perceive the traffic environment quickly and effectively in a larger range, and help agents achieve more effective collaboration. Moreover, the Deep Graph Q-learning (DGQ) algorithm is proposed in this model to optimize the traffic signal control strategy according to the spatio-temporal characteristics of different traffic scenes and provide the optimal signal phase for each intersection. This study also integrates the ecological traffic concept into MARL traffic signal control, which aims to reduce traffic exhaust emissions. Finally, the proposed GCQN-TSC is experimentally validated both in a synthetic traffic grid and a real-world traffic network using the SUMO simulator. The experimental results show that GCQN-TSC outperforms other traffic signal control methods in almost all performance metrics, including average queue length and waiting time, as it can aggregate information acquired from collaborative agents and make network-level signal optimization decisions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10489-022-03208-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, the environmental sustainability compensation mechanism of Shanghai City has been reevaluated, calculated, and analyzed based on LCA-emergy methodology in order to compare and judge whether the current compensation mechanism and standard are qualified. The results demonstrate that (1) emergy amount of incineration accounts for approximately 50% of the total emergy, followed by emergy amount of gas pollution (33%), emergy amount of recycling (6%), emergy amount of discard (5%), emergy amount of landfill (4%), and emergy amount of storage (2%). Compared with emergy sustainability index, emergy amount of landfill (1.620) has the best level of sustainability, followed by emergy amount of incineration (1.307), emergy amount of discard (1.302), and emergy amount of storage (0.752). (2) The new emergy ecological subsidy standard should be 1045.14 $/t in Shanghai City, but the current national standard is 82.2 $ (about 12.7:1), which has caused a lot of negative impact on the ecological environment in Shanghai City. Meanwhile, the error variation of each factor is analyzed by artificial neural network. In order to balance the gap between them, some positive measures and policies should be adopted in the municipal solid waste treatment system, including raising subsidies for waste disposal, improving the efficiency of the recyclable garbage disposal, and enhancing the use proportion of renewable energy.

Many contestations arise from the effects of inequitable access and intersecting crises currently faced by cities, which may be amplified by the algorithmic and data-centric infrastructures being introduced in urban contexts. In this article, I argue for a critical lens into how inter-related urban technologies, big data and policies, constituted as Urban AI, offer both challenges and opportunities. I examine scenarios of contestations in urban mobility , defined broadly to include equitable access, movement, and liberty to engage with the socio-cultural, political, and urban fabric of cities. I anchor my arguments through a framework of rights, risks, and responsibilities for critically examining and configuring the roles, values and ethical implications for all stakeholders including human, AI and non-human entities within an urban ecosystem. As a way forward, I examine the European Commission’s proposed regulations on AI systems through an illustrative case study of an automated parking control system introduced by the City of Amsterdam.

The present study aimed to predict flood vulnerability for Warsaw, Poland, using three machine learning models, such as the Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), the artificial neural networks (ANN), and the deep learning neural networks (DLNNs). The perfomance of these three methods was assessed in order to select the best method for flood vulnerability mapping in densely urbanized city. Thus, initially, thirteen flood predictors were evaluated using the information gain ratio (IGR), and eight most important predictors were considered from model training and testing. The performance of the applied models and accuracy of the result was evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures. By using the testing dataset, the result reveals that DLNN (AUC = 0.877) is the more performant model in comparison to ANN (AUC = 0.851) and BLR (AUC = 0.697).

In this research, prediction of SSC has been done using artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and multi-linear regression (MLR) models. Performance evaluation of developed models has been carried out on the basis of root mean square error ( RMSE ), correlation coefficient ( r ), coefficient of efficiency ( CE ) and pooled average relative error ( PARE ). Cross-correlation function (CCF) validated that gamma test (GT) is an appropriate tool for the selection of most responsive input variables. On the basis of GT and CCF, GT-6 model was selected as the model with most effective input variables, with the values of gamma, standard error and V -ratio as 0.0643, 0.00583 and 0.2570, respectively.

By leveraging the emerging availability of crowdsourced data, we aim for novel insights on how they relate to each other, which remains a substantial scientific challenge. Specifically, our study focuses on extracting spatial-temporal information from taxi trips in an attempt on grouping urban space based on human mobility, and subsequently assess its potential relationship with urban functional characteristics in terms of local points-of-interest (POI) distribution. Proposing a vector representation of urban areas, constructed via unsupervised machine learning on trip data’s temporal and geographic factors, the underlying idea is to define areas as “related” if they often act as destinations of similar departing regions at similar points in time, regardless of any other explicit information. Hidden relations are mapped within the generated vector space, whereby areas are represented as points and stronger/weaker relatedness is conveyed through relative distances. The mobility-related outcome is then compared with the POI-type distribution across the urban environment, to assess the functional consistency of mobility-based clusters of urban areas. Results indicate a meaningful relationship between spatial-temporal motion patterns and urban distributions of a diverse selection of POI-type categorizations, paving the way to ideally identify homogenous urban functional zones only based on the movement of people. Our data-driven approach is intended to complement traditional urban development studies on providing a novel perspective to urban activity modeling, standing out as a reference for mining information out of mobility and POI data types in the context of urban management and planning.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s43762-022-00049-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The water quality of the reservoir is an important factor affecting the safety of water supply. Timely and accurate water quality prediction is very important for the formulation of a scientific and reasonable reservoir water supply plan. Considering the problem of high requirement of basic data in constructing water quality hydrodynamic physical model, this paper established a new data-driven model of water quality prediction in urban reservoir based on the Long and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and the water quality data’s decomposition is implemented through the Complete Ensemble Empirical Modal Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method. This model can not only realize the water quality prediction during different foreseen periods, but also solve the problem of low prediction accuracy caused by the randomness and large volatility of the measured data. Taking Xili Reservoir in Shenzhen of China as an example, the prediction of water concentration including total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus and PH value of Xili reservoir was realized based on historical monitoring data. Through simulation calculation, the prediction results of total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus and PH value in the water quality prediction model are highly consistent with the measured results, it is found that the simulation effect is good, and this model can well simulate the reservoir’s water quality concentration change process. For the total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen, the relative prediction error of the model can be controlled below 10%, which shows the rationality of the built model. The research of this paper can provide an important theoretical and technical support for the water quality prediction and operation plan formulation of Xili Reservoir.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11269-022-03224-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Firstly, this work analyzes the relevant theories and processing methods of short-term traffic flow prediction. Secondly, the random forest regression (RFR) theory in machine learning is discussed to realize the short-term traffic flow prediction model (STTPM). Meanwhile, STTPM data are processed by k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and optimized by Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) and RFR method. Finally, the KNN-CEEMD-RFR model is proposed, and the performance of the model is evaluated. The results show that the proposed KNN-CEEMD-RFR model has better traffic prediction effect than support vector regression, RFR model, and CEEMD-RFR model. The prediction of support vector regression model is the worst, followed by RFR model. The mean square error of CEEMD-RFR is about 2% lower than that of RFR without data preprocessing. The mean square error of KNN-CEEMD-RFR model is 4% smaller than that of CEEMD-RFR model. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the proposed KNN-CEEMD-RFR model is more than 92%, which has a very ideal prediction effect.

The current classification method does not incorporate crucial urban auxiliary GIS data on building height and imperviousness that could significantly improve urban-type LCZ classification utility as well as accuracy. This study utilized a hybrid GIS- and remote sensing imagery-based framework to systematically compare and evaluate different machine and deep learning methods. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier outperforms in terms of accuracy, but it requires multi-pixel input, which reduces the output’s spatial resolution and creates a tradeoff between accuracy and spatial resolution. The Random Forest (RF) classifier performs best among the single-pixel classifiers. This study also shows that incorporating building height dataset improves the accuracy of the high- and mid-rise classes in the RF classifiers, whereas an imperviousness dataset improves the low-rise classes. The single-pass forward permutation test reveals that both auxiliary datasets dominate the classification accuracy in the RF classifier, while near-infrared and thermal infrared are the dominating features in the CNN classifier. These findings show that the conventional LCZ classification framework used in the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) can be improved by adopting building height and imperviousness information.

In this paper, we propose a deep spatio-temporal residual network model based on Region-reConStruction algorithm to predict the usage of shared bikes in the bike-sharing system. We first propose an Region-reConStruction algorithm (RCS) to partition the shared bicycle sites within a city into separate areas based on their geographic location information as well as bikes’ migration trends between stations. We then combine the RCS algorithm with a deep spatio-temporal residual network to model the key factors affecting the usage of shared bicycles. RCS makes good use of the migration trend of shared bikes during user usage, thus greatly improving the accuracy of prediction.

Differential privacy, a state-of-the-art formal notion, has been used as the privacy guarantee in two different and independent steps when training deep learning models. On one hand, we considered gradient perturbation , which uses the differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm to guarantee the privacy of each time series sample in the learning stage. On the other hand, we considered input perturbation , which adds differential privacy guarantees in each sample of the series before applying any learning. We compared four state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and their Bidirectional architectures, i.e., Bidirectional-LSTM and Bidirectional-GRU. Extensive experiments were conducted with a real-world multivariate mobility dataset, which we published openly along with this paper. As shown in the results, differentially private deep learning models trained under gradient or input perturbation achieve nearly the same performance as non-private deep learning models, with loss in performance varying between $$0.57$$ 0.57 and $$2.8\%$$ 2.8 % . The contribution of this paper is significant for those involved in urban planning and decision-making, providing a solution to the human mobility multivariate forecast problem through differentially private deep learning models.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-022-07393-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The disease in question both physically restricts mobility and brings along psychological problems. Especially in advanced ages, paralysis becomes much more difficult and requires serious care since it causes many effects in elderly people’s daily routines, required specific healthcare services, costs…etc. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to design an Internet of Health Things (IoHT)-based unmanned robot vehicle for paralyzed patients, by using deep learning for control of the system and creating a connected healthcare synergy. In this context, the electronic part of the robot was designed first and then a deep learning-based model was created. Before creating the model, the data obtained from the sensors were adequately pre-processed, and the related problem formation was shaped for a Deep Learning process. In order to compare the Deep Learning model with other machine learning techniques from the state of the art, different models based on Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were generated using the same data. The performances of these models were compared and the obtained results were analyzed. According to the experimental results, the Deep Learning model has the highest performance with 99.5% success rate and 0.5% loss rate. This work presents some relevant results in which using deep learning techniques point excellent performances in the area of IoHT applications. A second contribution of this paper is related to the evaluation of the communication flow of the systems, to analyze if it was good enough to cover a smart environment. The findings in this manner were positive in terms of technical analysis and the patient feedback taken from a total of 10 paralyzed patients.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11227-021-04292-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Compared with classical prediction methods, recently published ones based on neural networks have made significant improvements, but there still exist problems. First, several valuable characteristics in human mobility, such as the geographic relevance, community, and diversity of user movements, are not fully exploited. Second, the sparsity and imbalance of the check-in data also greatly restrict the prediction performance. To alleviate them, this manuscript proposes a new human mobility prediction method called the group-based multi-features move (GMFMove). This method constructs a prediction model based on recurrent neural network and attention mechanism. Three important factors that influence user movements, i.e., the sequence of location, the category of location, and the geographic relevance of human mobility, are taken into consideration in the model to better capture the mobility preference. Furthermore, GMFMove uses a deep-learning-based matrix factorization to integrate prior information including implicit feedbacks and social relationships for grouping users. Then, for each user group, we use a separate multi-features move (MFMove) model to train it and get the subresult. Finally, all of them are integrated in terms of the weights to obtain the final prediction result. We conduct extensive experiments on four real check-in datasets, and the experimental results show that GMFMove method significantly outperforms other methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-022-06971-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We focus on 2D leaching of hardened cement paste under diffusive or advective-dispersive transport conditions, a solid solution representation of the calcium silicate hydrates and either 4 or 7 chemical components, and use the HPx (coupled Hydrus-PHREEQC model) reactive transport code as baseline. We find that after training, both our DNN-based and kNN-based codes, $$\hbox {HPx}_{\rm{py}}$$ HPx py -DNN and $$\hbox {HPx}_{\rm{py}}$$ HPx py -kNN, can make satisfactorily to very accurate predictions while providing either a 3 to 9 speedup factor compared to HPx with parallelized geochemical calculations over 4 cores. Benchmarking against single-threaded HPx, these speedup factors become 8 to 33. Overall, $$\hbox {HPx}_{\rm{py}}$$ HPx py -DNN and $$\hbox {HPx}_{\rm{py}}$$ HPx py -kNN are found to achieve a close to optimal speedup when DNN regression and kNN search are performed on a GPU. Importantly, for the more complex 7-components cement system, no emulator that is globally accurate over the full space of possible geochemical conditions could be devised. Instead we therefore build “local” emulators that are only valid over a relevant fraction of the input parameter space. This space is identified by running a coarse and thus computationally cheap full RT simulation, and subsequently explored by kernel density sampling.

This study aimed to predict PM_10 concentrations by analyzing air pollutant data in Korea (Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, and Busan) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning methods. Real-time data from January 2014 to December 2020 were organized as hourly averages. The SO_2, NO_2, CO, O_3, and PM_10 data from 2014 to 2018 were used for training, and data from 2019 to 2020 were used as test data. The highest prediction accuracy was accomplished using all observations. The contribution ratio of each model component to the predictions was verified using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and PM_10 showed the greatest contribution. The other components, as secondary aerosol precursors, were divided by area. CO and O_3 were found to be high in Seoul (Gwanak), which has been highly urbanized. On the other hand, CO and NO_2 were found to be high in Incheon (Namdong), Daejeon (Yuseong), and Busan (Sasang), which are relatively suburban areas. The deep learning results indicated that the predicted PM_10 concentration was most affected by past and present concentrations of PM_10.

This not only enhances pollution but also leads to several road accident fatalities which may be greatly reduced by proper monitoring and surveillance. Further, with the advent of UAV technology and due to the incompatibility of traditional techniques, surveillance has become one of UAVs prominent application domains. However, it requires algorithmic analysis of aerial images which becomes extremely challenging due to multi-scale rotating objects with large aspect ratios, extremely imbalanced categories, cluttered background, and birds-eye view. Therefore, this article presents the novel aerial image traffic monitoring and surveillance algorithms based on the most advanced and popular DL object detection models (Faster-RCNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv4) using the AU-AIR dataset. This dataset is exceedingly imbalanced and to resolve this issue, another 500 images have been grabbed by web-mining techniques. The novel contribution of this work is two-fold. First, this article scientifically distinguishes the inappropriateness of ground-view images for aerial object detection. Second, a regress comparison of these algorithms has been made to investigate their effectiveness. Extensive experimental analysis endorses the efficiency of YOLOv4 as it outperforms the other developed models by a minimum mAP margin of 88%. Also, more than 6 times high detection speed and greater adaptability with stronger detection robustness ensure its real-time practical implementation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-021-11146-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To perform the 3D parameter regression, we replace YOLOv5’s anchor boxes with our hybrid anchor boxes. Our method is available in different model sizes such as YOLOv5: small, medium, and large. The new model that we propose is optimized for real-time embedded constraints (lightweight, speed, and accuracy) that takes advantage of the improvement brought by split attention (SA) convolutions called small split attention model (Small-SA).

In addition, it seeks to work against the assumption that advocating for transparency in algorithms is, therefore, the key for achieving an enhanced understanding of the role of algorithmic technologies on modern life. Drawing on applied assemblage thinking via the concept of the urban assemblage, I demonstrate how the notion of urban assemblage can work as an alternative way to explore the distributed and potential dimensions of what has been termed as Urban AI phenomena. Rather than seeing Urban AI phenomena as black-boxed, unknown and opaque, the notion of urban assemblage locates such entities within the wider contests of the city: urban places, communities and politics, where human-algorithmic relationships gather and disperse. In addition, this approach focuses on the potentialities of Urban AI phenomena—how algorithmic systems can operate differently through different aspects of the city—which can be seen to manifest new forms of resistance, collective actions and democracy. I use a case study of an algorithmic system designed to facilitate digital democracy—vTaiwan—to exemplify how assemblage methodology foregrounds the role of cities as spaces and places for exploring the democratic possibilities of algorithmic systems.

The impact of such technological innovation on the social dynamics of the urban environment is an ever changing and multi-faceted field of research. In this paper, the space and time defined by the autonomous vehicle is used as a window to view the way in which a shift in urban transport dynamics can impact the temporal experience of an individual. Using the finite window of time created by an autonomous vehicle, a theoretical framework is put forward that seeks to show how contrasting narratives exist regarding the experience of the window of time within the autonomous vehicle. By taking a theoretical approach informed by social theory, the dissolution of barriers between separate spheres of life is explored to highlight the increased commodification of time. In focusing on both the space and time created by the autonomous vehicle this approach seeks to highlight how artificial intelligence can provide a contemporary space in the urban environment while also opening a new window of time. The cognitive dissonance observed when comparing the narratives of autonomous vehicle stakeholders and the historical shift in time use leads to a belief that technology makes the user more free in terms of time.

In order to develop the prediction model, measuring noise levels of five different hours, speed of vehicles, and traffic volume in every monitoring point have been studied and analyzed. Traffic volume, percent of heavy vehicles, speed, traffic flow, road gradient, pavement, road side carriageway distance factors were taken as input parameter, whereas L _Aeq as output parameter for formation of neural network architecture. As traffic flow is heterogenous which mainly contains 59%, two wheelers and different vehicle specifications with varying speeds also affect driving and honking behavior which constantly changing noise characteristics. From radial noise diagrams shown that average noise levels of all the stations beyond permissible limit and the highest noise levels were found at the speed of 50–55 km/h in both peak and non-peak hours. Noise descriptors clearly indicate high annoyance level in the study area. Artificial neural network with 7–7-5 formation has been developed and found as optimum due to its sum of square and overall relative error 0.858 and .029 in training and 0.458 and 0.862 in testing phase respectively.

Although attention to urban tourism development is increasing, this paper indicates that no comprehensive study has yet combined the two subjects of tourism development and branding for spatial modeling. Thus, for assessing urban tourism potential (AUTP), a novel hybrid modeling approach combining K-mean, fuzzy logic, and an artificial neural network (ANN) was used. The findings indicate that in Tabriz metropolis, areas 3 and 7 and the southwestern portion of region 6 have the most significant potential for urban tourism. In contrast, areas 4, 8, and 10 located within the worn-out urban fabric have the least potential for tourism. Subsequently, by examining the correlation between urban tourism conditioning factors (UTCFs) and tourism maps, it was determined that factors including distance from the catering centers, distance from the fault, quality of construction materials, distance from the historical centers, distance from the health centers, maximum temperature, and distance from the parking are the most critical in terms of increasing urban tourism's potential and branding.

However, the two existing types of solutions have inherent flaws. One is traditional models, such as the gravity model and radiation model. These models rely on fixed and simple mathematical formulas derived from physics, and ignore rich geographic semantics, which makes them difficult to model complex human mobility patterns. The other is the machine learning models, most of which simply leverage the features of Origin-Destination (OD), ignoring the topological nature of the interaction network and the spatial correlation brought by the nearby areas. In this paper, we propose a ‘preprocessing-encoder-decoder’ hybrid learning model, which can make full use of geographic semantic information and spatial neighborhood effects, thereby significantly improving the prediction performance. Specifically, in the preprocessing part, we divide the study area into grids, and then incorporates features such as location, population, and land use types. The second step of the encoder designs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve the fusion of neighborhood features, constructs a spatial interaction network with the grids as nodes and the flows as edges, and then uses the graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract the embeddings of the nodes.

The passenger-count inside a car will be restricted based on the vehicle capacity and the COVID-19 hot-spot zone. Traffic rules will be impacted to align with a similar contagious outbreak. The on-road ‘Yellow-Vulture’ cameras need to incorporate such surveillance rules to monitor related anomalies for preventing contamination. To maintain safe-distance, an automatic surveillance system will be preferred by the Government very soon. Moreover, facial mask usage during the journey has become an essential habit to stop the spread of the infection. In this article, we have proposed a deep-Learning based framework that employs an augmented image data set to provide proper surveillance in the transport system to maintain the health protocols. Fast and accurate detection of the number of passengers inside a car and their face masks from the traffic inspection camera feed has been demonstrated. We have exploited the advantages of the popular Transfer Learning approach with novel variations of images while performing the training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to watch over in-vehicle social-distancing in post-pandemic circumstances through deep-Learning based image analysis. The superiority of the proposed framework has been established over several state-of-the-art techniques using different numerical metrics and visual comparisons along with a support of statistical hypothesis test.

We evaluate these challenges in an open source map labeling tool (QGIS), provide results from a preliminary study, and discuss if there are other techniques that could be applicable to solving these challenges. These techniques are based on quantified cartographic rules or on machine learning. We focus on deep learning for which we provide several examples of techniques from other application domains that might have a potential in map label placement. The aim of the paper is to explore those techniques and to recommend future practical studies for each of the identified five challenges in map production.

Consistent developments in almost all realms of modern human society affected the health of the air adversely. Daily industrial, transport, and domestic activities are stirring hazardous pollutants in our environment. Monitoring and predicting air quality have become essentially important in this era, especially in developing countries like India. In contrast to the traditional methods, the prediction technologies based on machine learning techniques are proved to be the most efficient tools to study such modern hazards. The present work investigates six years of air pollution data from 23 Indian cities for air quality analysis and prediction. The dataset is well preprocessed and key features are selected through the correlation analysis. An exploratory data analysis is exercised to develop insights into various hidden patterns in the dataset and pollutants directly affecting the air quality index are identified. A significant fall in almost all pollutants is observed in the pandemic year, 2020. The data imbalance problem is solved with a resampling technique and five machine learning models are employed to predict air quality. The results of these models are compared with the standard metrics. The Gaussian Naive Bayes model achieves the highest accuracy while the Support Vector Machine model exhibits the lowest accuracy.

A Comparison of Two Deep Learning Methods for Flow and Transport Data Assimilation,Mathematical Geosciences,10.1007/s11004-022-10003-3,Springer,2022-05-12,"Groundwater modeling is an important tool for water resources management and aquifer remediation. However, the inherent strong heterogeneity of the subsurface and scarcity of observed data pose major challenges for groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling. Data assimilation such as the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) can be used to improve the understanding of the subsurface by integrating a variety of data into the modeling. For highly heterogeneous aquifers such as fluvial deposits, traditional data assimilation methods cannot preserve geological structures. In this work, two of the most popular deep learning methods, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), are compared for identifying geological structures using flow and transport data assimilation. Specifically, VAE and GAN are used to re-parameterize the hydraulic conductivity fields with low dimensional latent variables. The ES-MDA then is used to update the latent variables by assimilating the observed data such as hydraulic head and contaminant concentration into the model. Synthetic examples of both categorical and continuous variables are conducted to test the performance of coupling ES-MDA with VAE or GAN. The results demonstrate that the generating quality of GAN is better such that channels are generated with similar properties as in the training image, while VAE has the advantage that data assimilation is more successful in allowing better localization of the actual channels for the considered inverse problem.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11004-022-10003-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The route discovery process among the nodes depends on the network connectivity of the nodes in the MANETs. The selection of mobility nodes to offer reliable routing is facilitated by the presented mobility prediction algorithm. To predict node mobility, the proposed ARIMA model employs autocorrelation to forecast node mobility in the future with the random walk (RW) model. For the predicted mobility model, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and auto-correlation function (ACF) are assessed. The error performance metric mean square error (MSE) is very lower for the ARIMA-predicted mobility datasets as compared with the RNN-predicted mobility datasets. Different scenarios of speed values are examined for the proposed models. The error metrics for the walking scenario at the speed 1 and 1.5 m/s; the running scenario at the speed 4 and 10 m/s; and the cycling scenario at the speed 5 and 15 m/s are analyzed in the presented work.

The performance of such systems is heavily debated and so are the underlying scientific methods that serve as the basis for many such technologies. In this article I will engage with this new technology, and with the debates and literature that surround it. Working at the intersection of criminology, policing, surveillance and the study of emotional AI this paper explores and offers a framework of understanding the various issues that these technologies present particularly to liberal democracies. I argue that these technologies should not be deployed within public spaces because there is only a very weak evidence-base as to their effectiveness in a policing and security context, and even more importantly represent a major intrusion to people’s private lives and also represent a worrying extension of policing power because of the possibility that intentions and attitudes may be inferred. Further to this, the danger in the use of such invasive surveillance for the purpose of policing and crime prevention in urban spaces is that it potentially leads to a highly regulated and control-oriented society. I argue that emotion recognition has severe impacts on the right to the city by not only undertaking surveillance of existing situations but also making inferences and probabilistic predictions about future events as well as emotions and intentions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00146-022-01435-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Then, the study analyses the data using the summative content analysis technique with two data analysis software. The analysis identifies the following themes and generates insights into local government services: AI adoption areas, cautionary areas, challenges, effects, impacts, knowledge basis, plans, preparedness, roadblocks, technologies, deployment timeframes, and usefulness.

This article represents a self adaptive real-time traffic light control algorithm based on the traffic flow.

The proposed system utilizes single image processing via neural network and You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) framework to establish traffic clearance at the signal. We employed YOLO architectures because it is accurate in terms of mean average precision (mAP), interaction over union (IOU) values and fast in object detection tasks as well. It runs significantly faster than other detection methods with comparable performance. The average processing time of single image was estimated to be 1.3 s. Further based on the input from YOLO we estimated the ‘on’ time period green light for effective traffic clearance. Several real time parameters like number of vehicles (two wheelers, four wheelers), road width and junction crossing time are considered to estimate the ‘on’time of green light. Moreover, we used the real traffic images to test the performance and trained the system with different dataset.

In Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), vehicles act as connected entities, and exchange data with each other and with the back-end servers on the mobile network. These communications are often session based and require a light weight protocol for session establishment and continuity. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can act as the base for this kind of communication. However, its simplicity also makes the protocol vulnerable to various web attacks such as identity theft and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). As 5G technologies will enable high data rates to the users, this will also exponentially increase the threat of high-speed DDoS on the servers originating from different sources. Thus, appropriate solutions need to be developed for securing SIP systems from these threats. Machine Learning (ML) has transpired as a building block in cyber security solutions, and a large number of techniques are available to make quick and robust network defense systems by automating the identification of attack flows in the network. In this paper, a Deep Learning-based model is proposed for the identification and alleviation of DDoS attacks in SIP based networks. The work presented here uses a system that is scalable and highly available with load balancing and failover addressing capabilities. The datasets used for conducting experiments are created by emulating SIP sessions, generating DDoS attacks, capturing the normal and attack flows, and extracting time window-based features from the packets. A stacked autoencoder model is trained on the curated datasets to detect various types of DDoS attacks. Once an attack is detected, the Mitigation Policy Recommender module recommends various actions for threat mitigation. Performance of the system is assessed in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The proposed model obtains a significant improvement in the performance than the previously existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and detection rate.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11036-022-01973-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Efficient taxi cruising strategies are helpful to alleviate urban traffic congestions, reduce pollution emission, attenuate greenhouse gas, and also provide a fast service for passengers. However, in real scenarios, taxis cruising strategies are mostly based on their own experiences. At unfamiliar urban areas or during off-peak hours, drivers usually have no good idea for an optimal cruising strategy, which causes a low efficiency for service and also increases taxi operation costs. Considering that it is difficult to construct an analytical model for the taxis scheduling and cruising, in this paper, we put forward a data-driven model for multi-taxis cruising based on reinforcement learning. Furthermore, an evolutionary reinforcement learning method is proposed, which aims at improving the exploration of reinforcement learning and enhancing reinforcement learning to maximize the global reward in multi-agent tasks.

However, simple approaches for quickly and precisely measuring the flow velocity in microchannels are still lacking. Herein, we propose a deep neural networks assisted scalar imaging velocimetry (DNN-SIV) for quick and precise extraction of fluid velocity in a shallow microfluidic channel with a high aspect ratio, which is a basic geometry for cell culture, from a dye concentration field with spatiotemporal gradients. DNN-SIV is built on physics-informed neural networks and residual neural networks that integrate data of scalar field and physics laws to determine the height-averaged velocity. The underlying enforcing physics laws are derived from the Navier–Stokes equation and the scalar transport equation. Apart from this, dynamic concentration boundary condition is adopted to improve the velocity measurement of laminar flow with small Reynolds number in microchannels. The proposed DNN-SIV is validated and analyzed by numerical simulations. Compared to integral minimization algorithm used in conventional SIV, DNN-SIV is robust to noise in the measured scalar field and more efficiently allowing real-time flow visualization. Furthermore, the fundamental significance of rational construction of concentration field in microchannels is also underscored. The proposed DNN-SIV in this paper is agnostic to initial and boundary conditions that can be a promising velocity measurement approach for many potential applications in microfluidic chips, although its performance remains to be experimentally validated.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10404-022-02542-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many deep learning-based algorithms using two-dimensional images have become an essential tool for autonomous vehicles with object detection, tracking, and segmentation for road target detection, primarily including pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on visual data to classify and generalize target objects which can satisfy pedestrians’ and other vehicles’ safety requirements in their environment. In real-time, outstanding results are obtained by deep learning-based algorithms for object detection. While several studies have thoroughly examined different types of deep learning-based object detection methods, there are a few comparable studies that either test the detection speed or accuracy of the object detection algorithms. In addition to speed and accuracy, autonomous driving also depends on model size and energy efficiency. However, there is a lack of comparison on various such metrics among existing deep learning-based methods. This article aims to provide a detailed and systematic comparative analysis of five independent mainstream deep learning-based algorithms for road object detection, namely the R-FCN, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, and YOLOv4 on a large-scale Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD100K) dataset. The experimental results are analyzed using the mean Average Precision (mAP) value and inference time. Additionally, various practical metrics, such as model size, computational complexity, and energy efficiency of deep learning-based models are precisely computed. Furthermore, the performance of each algorithm is evaluated under different road environmental conditions at various times of day and night.

This newly suggested risk prediction model is for predicting risk by reflecting static features of the road, such its length and the speed limit on it, and dynamic features of the road, such as traffic volume when driving on it, and the altitude and azimuth of the sun. For this purpose, 4470 accident cases, collected over 5 months from August to December 2018 in Seoul—the most complex, high-traffic, and accident-prone city in Korea—were analyzed. As a result of testing the model using such data, it was found to have an accuracy of 75% and recall of 81%. Based on testing results for the suggested risk prediction model, a system was developed to guide not only accident-prone regions predicted using statistical data but to also guide a risk level for the road. This level of risk is estimated based upon each given situation, so it can change even for the same road. This guide system can be used to provide a level of risk for each road segment and region but also to improve roads with recommendations, such as installation of safety features.

Many regression analysis methods exist for assessing geographical flood risk; furthermore, a handful of machine learning methods have been created for mitigation and estimation purposes—there are none for prevention. Therefore, in this study, we developed a machine learning flood assessment model that leverages several machine learning models for the Busan Metropolitan City. Each was applied to a test dataset, and their performances were evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve; thereafter, the model determined to be the most reliable was used to create a flood risk assessment map. The model was then used to assess the areas of highest probability of flooding. Upon its completion, we discovered that flooding may now occur with less rainfall than that of the 10-year return period. The derived map is expected to be used as a basic source for the development of preventive countermeasures against urban flooding, thus contributing to the enhancement of flood control and response capacities in applicable regions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-021-05142-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This study is based on a large set of measurements collected from real pebbles, traced along the stream through radio-frequency identification tags after precipitation events. Two classes of data-driven models based on machine learning and functional geostatistics approaches are proposed and evaluated to predict the probability of movement of single pebbles within the stream. The first class built upon gradient-boosting decision trees allows one to estimate the probability of movement of a pebble based on the pebbles’ geometrical features, river flow rate, location, and subdomain types. The second class is built upon functional kriging, a recent geostatistical technique that allows one to predict a functional profile—that is, the movement probability of a pebble, as a function of the pebbles’ geometrical features or the stream’s flow rate—at unsampled locations in the study area. Although grounded in different perspectives, both models aim to account for two main sources of uncertainty, namely, (1) the complexity of a river’s morphological structure and (2) the highly nonlinear dependence between probability of movement, pebble size and shape, and the stream’s flow rate. The performance of the two methods is extensively compared in terms of classification accuracy. The analyses show that despite the different perspectives, the overall performance is adequate and consistent, which suggests that both approaches can provide modeling frameworks for sediment transport. These data-driven approaches are also compared with physics-based ones that are classically used in the hydrological literature. Finally, the use of the developed models in a bottom-up strategy, which starts with the prediction/classification of a single pebble and then integrates the results into a forecast of the grain-size distribution of mobilized sediments, is discussed.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11004-022-09995-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To accomplish this, the required data sets on the road geometric, traffic and built-environmental conditions are collected from 84 road segments located in various parts of four Indian cities. The satisfaction levels of bicyclists at each site are also assessed using a Likert scale of 1–6 (excellent–worst). Subsequently, three promising AI techniques namely, Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Genetic programming (GP) and Bayesian regularization neural network (BRNN) are utilized to develop the BLOS models. All models are trained and tested with eight significant attributes of the road segments. Among all models, the MARS-based one has shown the best prediction performance in the present context with a coefficient of determination ( R ^2) value of 0.92 with averaged observations. On the other hand, GP has produced the simplest (regression-like) but reliable model, which is the most favourable for field applications. The relative importance of input variables has concluded that the outermost lane width, traffic volume, on-street parking activities and pavement condition index are by far the most important variables in the present context.

Previous research has conceptualized AI transparency as knowledge that empowers citizens and experts to make informed choices about the use and governance of AI. Conversely, in this paper, we critically examine if transparency-as-knowledge is an appropriate concept for a public realm where private interests intersect with democratic concerns. We conduct a practice-based design research study in which we prototype and evaluate a transparent smart electric vehicle charge point, and investigate experts’ and citizens’ understanding of AI transparency. We find that citizens experience transparency as burdensome; experts hope transparency ensures acceptance, while citizens are mostly indifferent to AI; and with absent means of control, citizens question transparency’s relevance.

One simple click-on end device can make every tool accessible to users; however, whether correct information is received remains to be an open question. Incorrect information that bundles the factors of fake, malicious, or fraudulent information, whether deliberately or not, may worsen misunderstandings. To avoid these cases escalating to the level of crime, a universal financial fraud-awareness model was designed in this study. The model first targets accurate fraud detection and classification using the natural language processing technique. An anti-fraud chatbot is then implemented as an instance of the model and deployed on a widely used social network service, namely LINE. This implementation aims to manage finance-fraud cases and provide anti-fraud suggestions to deal with foreseeable fraud events. Statistics of the comparison between Word2vec, ELMO, BERT, and DistilBERT on the five-strong conventional machine-learning models and the models of artificial neural networks indicate that the proposed model can achieve an accuracy of over 98% while detecting potential finance-fraud cases.

It addresses prediction of fine particle air pollutants of diameter less than 2.5 µm (particulate matter 2.5), their concentration being substantially influenced by urban traffic. We collect worldwide multicity data from health-related public sources on which mining is performed using classical data mining/machine learning paradigms: association rules, clustering and classification. Challenges include adapting appropriate techniques based on data, and capturing subtle domain-specific aspects. The prediction tool is built using knowledge discovered by mining, leveraging health standards, catering to novice, intermediate and expert users. The prediction output is accurate, efficient, interpretable and useful as evident from our experiments. The tool is helpful for urban decision support.

Computer vision can be utilised to detect road users, conveying their presence to vehicles that cannot perceive them. However, accurate object detection algorithms are typically computationally heavy, depending on delay-prone cloud computation or expensive local hardware. Similar problems are faced in many intelligent transportation applications, in which road users are detected with a roadside camera. We propose utilising Motion Detection and Classification (MoDeCla) for road user detection. The approach is computationally lightweight and capable of running in real-time on an inexpensive single-board computer. To validate the applicability of MoDeCla in intelligent transportation applications, a detection benchmark was carried out on manually labelled data gathered from surveillance cameras overseeing urban areas in Espoo, Finland. Separate datasets were gathered during winter and summer, enabling comparison of the detectors in significantly different weather conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art object detectors, MoDeCla performed detection an order of magnitude faster, yet achieved similar accuracy. The most impactful deficiency of MoDeCla was errors in bounding box placement. Car headlights and long dark shadows were found especially difficult for the motion detection, which caused incorrect bounding boxes. Future improvements are also required for separately detecting overlapping road users.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-022-00581-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One mechanism for sending medical data is to send information to other medical centers without preserving confidentiality. This method is not impressive because in treating people, the privacy of medical information is a principle. In the proposed framework, the opinion of experts from other medical centers for the treatment of patients is received and consider the best therapy. The proposed method has two layers. In the first layer, data transmission uses blockchain. In the second layer, blocks related to patients’ records analyze by machine learning methods. Patient records place in a block of the blockchain. Block of patient sends to other medical centers. Each treatment center can recommend the proposed type of treatment and blockchain attachment and send it to all nodes and treatment centers. Each medical center receiving data of the patients, then predicts the treatment using data mining methods. Sending medical data between medical centers with blockchain and maintaining confidentiality is one of the innovations of this article. The proposed method is a binary version of the HHO algorithm for feature selection. Another innovation of this research is the use of majority voting learning in diagnosing the type of disease in medical centers.

For this goal, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) was used to consider the latent relationships among large geographical regions. The solution has been evaluated with an open dataset including trips throughout the country of Spain and the current weather conditions. The results indicate a high accuracy in predicting the number of trips for multiple time horizons, and more important, they show that our proposal only needs a single model for processing all the mobility areas in the dataset, whereas other techniques require a different model for each area under study.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10489-021-02645-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While the entry and exit passenger demand prediction problem has been studied in various studies, the OD passenger flow prediction problem receives much less attention. One key challenge for short-term OD flow prediction is the partial observability of the OD flow information due to trips having not been completed at a certain time interval. This paper develops a novel deep learning architecture for the OD flow prediction in urban railway systems and examines various mechanisms for data representation and for dealing with partial information. The deep learning framework consists of three main components, including multiple LSTM networks with an attention mechanism capturing short/long-term temporal dependencies, a temporally shifted graph matrix for spatiotemporal correlations, and a reconstruction mechanism for partial OD flow observations. The model is validated using smart card data from Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system and compared with state-of-the-art prediction models. Experiments are designed to examine the characteristics of the proposed approach and its various components. The results show the superior performance (accuracy and robustness) of the proposed model and also the importance of partial observations of OD flow information in improving prediction performance.

In this paper, interatomic potential driven by machine learning is developed based on datasets generated by first-principle molecular dynamics simulations in order to research the local structure and properties of molten Li_2CO_3-Na_2CO_3 binary salts at target temperatures. The machine learning potential enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to DFT and yields precise descriptions of microstructures and properties. Microstructural evolution is analyzed through partial radial distribution functions. We observed lithium cation exhibits more coordination modes and the strength of Na^+ with CO_3^2− is weaker than that of Li^+. Further, comparing the inter-ionic partial radial distribution function diagrams of binary melts and those of pure melt, interatomic characteristics were obtained. The evolution of properties calculated by machine learning, including density, self-diffusion coefficients, thermal conductivity, and viscosity over the entire operating temperature range, is documented. The relationships between properties and temperature or properties and the fraction of Li_2CO_3 were explored by the trained machine learning potential.

In 5G-based mobile edge computing (MEC) environment, efficient caching at the edge of the network provides a solution for satisfying the quality of experience (QoE) requirements for lower latency. An intelligent caching strategy for MEC based on machine learning has been proposed, namely EICache, which considers the user’s mobility and interest preferences. It could predict user’s mobility using historical trajectory based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, and predict interest using Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) method, to obtain the content of interest in advance, and then cache the content in advance on the neighboring edge node where the user is likely to go. Performance evaluations have been conducted using public YouTube trending video datasets from Kaggle and real trajectory datasets, compared with different cache replacement methods. The metrics of the cache hit rate, and the overall request latency are used for evaluation. By training the datasets first and then predicting, the accuracy of LSTM-based location prediction is about 80%, and the accuracy of GBDT-based interest prediction reaches about 25.4%.

Increasing access to large datasets collected in real time could make certain mathematical models developed in research fields related to the management of urban systems obsolete. These ongoing evolutions are the subject of numerous works whose main angle of reflection is the future of cities rather than the transformations at work in the academic field. Our article proposes grasp the scientific dynamics in areas of research related to two urban systems: transportation and water. The article demonstrates the importance of grasping these dynamics if we want to be able to apprehend what the urban management of tomorrow's cities will be like. To analyse these research areas’ dynamics, we use two complementary materials: bibliometric data and interviews. The interviews conducted in 2018 with academics and higher education officials in Paris and Edinburgh suggest avenues for hybridization between traditional modelling approaches and research in machine learning, artificial intelligence and Big Data. The bibliometric analysis highlight the trends at work: it shows that traffic flow as well as transportation studies are focussing more and more on AI and Big Data and that traffic flow studies are arousing a growing interest among computer scientists, while, so far, this interest is less pronounced in the water research area, and more especially regarding water quality. The differences observed between research on transportation and that on water confirm the multifaceted nature of the developments at work and encourage us to reject overly hasty and simplistic generalisations about the transformations underway.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00146-021-01166-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of this study is modeling landscape aesthetic quality of urban parks using an artificial neural network to predict the value of landscape aesthetic and prioritizing the influential variables of the model. To evaluate the landscape aesthetic quality in the urban park, a combination of user perspective and artificial neural network modeling approach has been used. The aesthetic quality of 100 urban park landscapes was quantified based on citizens' perception. Totally, 15 landscape attributes were recorded as influential variables on visual quality of landscape.

Classical methods include the phase retrieval algorithm based on the transport of intensity equation (TIE) and iteration. The phase retrieval algorithm based on TIE can directly obtain the absolute phase without reference beam and phase unwrapping but is sensitive to noise. On the other hand, the intensity difference method needs to be used to approximate the intensity differential when solving the algorithm. Therefore, the defocus distance between intensity images has great influence on the accuracy of retrieval results. The phase retrieval algorithm based on TIE will be limited if it is extended to the phase retrieval of large objects. In order to widen its application range, an adaptive phase retrieval algorithm based on convolutional neural network under all defocus distances is proposed. The new algorithm consists of two important components: phase retrieval algorithm module and convolutional neural network optimization module. Firstly, the preliminary retrieval results are obtained by the phase retrieval algorithm module at different defocus distances, and then the accuracy of the results is further improved by the convolutional neural network module.

We find that intracity spatial homogeneity is highly associated with socioeconomic status indicators such as gross domestic product and population growth. Moreover, intercity spatial homogeneity values obtained by transferring the model across different cities reveal the intercity similarity of urban network structures originating in Europe, passed on to cities in the United States and Asia.

Based on these rationales, we compare different machine learning algorithms to determine their efficacy and robustness at modeling the different transport processes in the Reynolds stress transport equations. Those data-driven algorithms include Random forests, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for flow in channels are used both as training and testing of the ML models. The optimal hyper-parameters of the ML algorithms are determined using Bayesian optimization. The efficacy of the above-mentioned algorithms is assessed in the modeling and prediction of the terms in the Reynolds stress transport equations. It was observed that all three algorithms predict the turbulence parameters with an acceptable level of accuracy. These ML models are then applied for the prediction of the pressure strain correlation of flow cases that are different from the flows used for training, to assess their robustness and generalizability. This explores the assertion that ML-based data-driven turbulence models can overcome the modeling limitations associated with the traditional turbulence models and ML models trained with large amounts of data with different classes of flows can predict flow field with reasonable accuracy for unknown flows with similar flow physics.

We investigate whether feasible market equilibriums arise without central control or communication between agents. Observed behavior in such environments serves as a stepping stone towards self-organizing logistics systems like the Physical Internet, while also offering valuable insights for the design of contemporary transport brokerage platforms. We model an agent-based environment in which shipper and carrier actively learn bidding strategies using policy gradient methods, posing bid- and ask prices at the individual container level. Both agents aim to learn the best response given the expected behavior of the opposing agent. Inspired by financial markets, a neutral broker allocates jobs based on bid-ask spreads. Our game-theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focus on behavioral insights. To evaluate system performance, we measure adherence to Nash equilibria, fairness of reward division and utilization of transport capacity. We observe good performance both in predictable, deterministic settings ( $$\sim $$ ∼  95% adherence to Nash equilibria) and highly stochastic environments ( $$\sim $$ ∼  85% adherence). Risk-seeking behavior may increase an agent’s reward share, yet overly aggressive strategies destabilize the system. The results suggest a potential for full automation and decentralization of freight transport markets.

Reconstruction-based methods can sometimes show low error on simple-to-reconstruct points that are not part of the training data, for example the all black image. Instead, we introduce a new unsupervised Lipschitz anomaly discriminator (LAD) that does not suffer from these biases. Our anomaly discriminator is trained, similar to the discriminator of a GAN, to detect the difference between the training data and corruptions of the training data. We show that this procedure successfully detects unseen anomalies with guarantees on those that have a certain Wasserstein distance from the data or corrupted training set. These additions allow us to show improved performance on MNIST, CIFAR10, and health record data. Further, LAD does not require decoding back to the original data space, which makes anomaly detection possible in domains where it is difficult to define a decoder, such as in irregular graph structured data.

The TMS, along with data analysis techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and/or Data Mining (DM) are useful tools for demand forecasting, facilitating strategic, tactical and operational decision making, which ultimately improves the logistics distribution performance. For this, this work proposes a methodology that will compare three prediction methods (traditional statistical method, hybrid method and artificial neural network), which will be tested through the Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicator to determine which one has more accurate results in the forecast of demand for freight transport. The experimental results obtained in this research show that the historical data saved in a TMS can be used for reliably freight transportation demand forecasting.

Machine learning methods, and neural networks, in particular, are useful in modeling this sort of complex problems, although they generally lack of probabilistic interpretations. We propose a neural network method embedded in a Bayesian framework for modeling and predicting the number of cases of infectious diseases in areal units. A key feature is that our combined model considers the impact of human movement on the spread of the infectious disease, as an additional random factor to the also considered spatial neighborhood and temporal correlation components. Our model is evaluated over a COVID-19 dataset for 245 health zones of Castilla-Leon (Spain).

Such applications include augmented reality, online gaming, and other real-time applications that need higher computational resources. These applications, executing on mobile devices, often need to access external computing resources and offload the application tasks to the cloud or mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. However, delivering task offloading results to the users in the MEC environment is a challenge, certainly when user mobility is high. Sub-optimal server selection at the offloading stage increases latency, energy consumption and deteriorates both quality of experience and quality of service. Existing techniques proposed in the literature handle computation offloading and mobility management separately. Without considering the real-time mobility factors, the solutions produced are sub-optimal. Some solutions exist to manage mobility, but they involve higher time complexity. We consider the user mobility in offloading decisions and present a lightweight mobility prediction and offloading (LiMPO) framework that offloads the compute-intensive tasks to the predicted user location using artificial neural networks with less complexity. In addition, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm based server selection technique that jointly optimizes latency and energy consumption while improving the resource utilization of MEC servers. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with two other techniques task-assignment with optimized mobility and dynamic mobility-aware offloading algorithm for edge computing.

Computer vision techniques, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) applied on video monitoring data, can provide a cost-efficient and timely alternative to traditional data collection and analysis methods. This paper presents a framework designed to take videos as input and output traffic volume counts and intersection turning patterns. This framework comprises a CNN model and an object tracking algorithm to detect and track vehicles in the camera’s pixel view first. Homographic projection then maps vehicle spatial-temporal information (including unique ID, location, and timestamp) onto an orthogonal real-scale map, from which the traffic counts and turns are computed. Several video data are manually labeled and compared with the framework output. The following results show a robust traffic volume count accuracy up to 96.91%. Moreover, this work investigates the performance influencing factors including lighting condition (over a 24-h-period), pixel size, and camera angle. Based on the analysis, it is suggested to place cameras such that detection pixel size is above 2343 and the view angle is below 22°, for more accurate counts. Next, previous and current traffic reports after Texas A&M home football games are compared with the framework output. Results suggest that the proposed framework is able to reproduce traffic volume change trends for different traffic directions. Lastly, this work also contributes a new intersection turning pattern, i.e., counts for each ingress-egress edge pair, with its optimization technique which result in an accuracy between 43% and 72%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s43762-021-00031-w,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Geospatial data and technology can be used to measure urban sprawl and predict urban expansion. This technology can shed light on the characteristics, causes, and consequences of urban expansion. Unlike other studies, the methodology proposed in this paper works on a regional level rather than an individual city. In this article, Land Use Land Cover changes and the magnitude and direction of city-region sprawl in the Isfahan Metropolitan area were modelled using a multi-temporal analysis of remote sensing imagery. Shannon’s Entropy was used to quantify city-region dispersion during the last fifty years. A Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain Analysis were then used to forecast future city-region sprawl based on past patterns and physical constraints. The results revealed that this region has been suffering from sprawl during this period in different directions. Moreover, it will continue in specific directions due to several economic, political, demographic, environmental, and (urban) planning factors.

However, the growing demand for groundwater must meet the needs of an enormous community to sustain the severe effects of limited water resources. Therefore, the groundwater level (GWL) should be analyzed for efficient groundwater management to identify groundwater usages. However, predicting the GWL is a challenging task in water resource management because of large complex data. So, this research has proposed generalized intelligence control with hybrid ant colony African buffalo optimization (GIC with HAC-ABO) approach to forecast the GWL in alluvial aquifers at Varanasi City. Initially, the well locations at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, are identified with the use of differential global positioning system (DGPS). Subsequently, the GWL in the well for post-monsoon and pre-monsoon is measured using a graduated steel tape. Then the fitness value of HAC-ABO in GIC was updated to predict the GWL in Varanasi wells. Here, the proposed technique has analyzed the GWL for both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for every year and also predicts the future GWL in Varanasi well after 30 years.

This calls for the algorithms with highly adaptive ability of perception and computation. By actively interacting with the surroundings, optimal control decision strategies can be automatically calculated. Although research efforts have been devoted to this domain for many years, the general mathematical optimization methods can only find the approximated solutions inside systems, which makes the performance of the transportation systems difficult to achieve perfectly optimal. In this context, introduction of intelligent technologies represented by artificial intelligence has been regarded as a promising perspective. Artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science, attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and simulates a novel intelligent machine that can respond in the ways similar to human intelligence. Since the birth of AI, its theory and technology have become increasingly mature, expanding applications in many fields such as robotics, language recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and expert systems. It can be imagined that the scientific and technological products brought by artificial intelligence in the future will be the “container” of human intelligence. Generalized into transportation systems, the AI abstracts the complex system processes as black boxes and then uses the idea of statistical learning to model the complex system processes. By discovering potential and unobservable patterns, the AI provides more opportunities to solve the uncertainty problems hidden in the transportation systems. Predictably, the AI technology will be the key breakthrough in the evolution from conventional transportation systems to autonomous transportation systems. Therefore, this chapter is organized via three aspects of contents: (1) Overview of AI; (2) Need and Evolution of AI; and (3) AI for Transportation Systems. In this chapter, the wide AI conception is described by dividing it into three branches: cognitive AI, machine learning AI, and deep learning AI. Further, the need and evolution of AI are surveyed via three parts.

Image semantics is a complex problem where the image classification, the semantic segmentation and the object detection subroutines are staged in a cascade framework through spatio-temporal datasets. Urban scene analysis has been coupled in several applications such as security, autonomous vehicles, and mass transport. The initial problem of an urban scene is characterized as the pursuit of discrete 2D-3D movements on the street. Therefore, an accurate segmentation of the scene is required to minimize the spatial gap in the scene. The complete framework provides critical decision-making tools to protect the human and the moving objects. New generation autonomous systems turn on their real time sensors to monitor all possible movements in a street. However, the sensing stage must be interpreted within semantics to generate the city insights. The task of semantic segmentation is to label every pixel including the background into a semantic class. The object detection locates the presence of objects and types or classes of the located objects in an image. The instance segmentation contains these two tasks. This paper is composed of the instance segmentation of base objects through Cityscapes dataset. YOLACT deep learning architecture has been applied on high resolution images.

Time series analysis models exploit forecasting techniques based solely on the history of the variable of interest. They work by capturing patterns in historical data and extrapolating them into the future. The Times Series features recurring structures that can be captured through careful and precise analysis of its performance. Machine Learning-based methods are able to identify these recurring structures fully automatically. In this chapter we have faced the problem of the elaboration of forecasting models based on Deep Learning algorithms for data with time series characteristics. First, we introduced the Time Series, and we analyzed the most popular forecast models based on the traditional methodologies of classical Statistics. Next, we introduced Deep Learning-based methodologies that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain and which have proven effective in capturing the recurring characteristics of time series. In this context, we developed a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks for the prediction of equivalent noise levels produced by a road infrastructure.

Fine-grained vehicle classification appears to be a challenging task as compared to vehicle coarse classification. Exploring a robust approach for vehicle detection and classification into fine-grained categories is therefore essentially required. Existing Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) systems have been developed on synchronized and controlled traffic conditions. Need for robust VMMR in complex, urban, heterogeneous, and unsynchronized traffic conditions still remain an open research area. In this paper, vehicle detection and fine-grained classification are addressed using deep learning. To perform fine-grained classification with related complexities, local dataset THS-10 having high intraclass and low interclass variation is exclusively prepared. The dataset consists of 4250 vehicle images of 10 vehicle models, i.e., Honda City, Honda Civic, Suzuki Alto, Suzuki Bolan, Suzuki Cultus, Suzuki Mehran, Suzuki Ravi, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Wagon R and Toyota Corolla. This dataset is available online. Due to having almost no design variation in some make and models over the years, vehicle models are not separated by their year of generation. Two approaches have been explored and analyzed for classification of vehicles i.e., fine-tuning, and feature extraction from deep neural networks. A comparative study is performed, and it is demonstrated that simpler approaches can produce good results in local environment to deal with complex issues such as dense occlusion and lane departures. Hence reducing computational load and time, e.g. finetuning Inception-v3 produced highest accuracy of 97.4% with lowest misclassification rate of 2.08%. Finetuning MobileNet-v2 and ResNet-18 produced 96.8% and 95.7% accuracies, respectively.

Controlling the operational tasks of the OTN intelligently will overcome the wrongs behavior of the human interventions while they are provisioning the optical network and will enhance the performance of the communication networks to the end customers. One of the most encouraging technologies which can assist in the administrating the assets of the OTN is the Artificial Inelegance (AI), that can be employed in the provisioning of the optical network to perform several of the everyday tasks in the network instead of using human interventions. In this paper, for the first time, we present the machine learning (ML) as a branch of the AI technology to handle and perform the routine tasks in the OTN of Egypt in smart and automated techniques. The expected outcomes from practicing ML in managing OTN show that the time of the fault localization will be reduced from average 40 min to about 10 min and consequently this will decrease main time of repair (MTTR) by about 30 min, the number of the customer’s tickets will be lowered by about 25%, and the number of network faults will be decreased by about 75% as a result of performing the preventive maintenance tasks of the network in an automated technique, and the reply time to the clients is expected to be reduced from average 50 min to about 5 min only.

The proposed approach, called DA-SSL (Domain Adaptation meets Semi-Supervised Learning) attempts to find a joint subspace of the source and target domains using Linear Discriminant Analysis, such that the projections of the data into this latent subspace can be both domain invariant and discriminative. This aim, however, can be rather difficult to accomplish because of the missing labeled data in the target domain. To defeat this challenge, we use an incremental semi-supervised approach based on optimal transport theory, that conducts selective pseudo-labeling for unlabeled target instances.

The smart city uses innovative technology to manage and operate cities intelligently. Through the research of facial expression recognition technology, this paper explores the application of facial expression recognition in smart city construction. In this paper, a hybrid neural network structure is proposed, which includes Sparse Autoencoder and Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN). The network reconstructs the input data by Sparse Autoencoder, so as to learn the approximate value between the original data and the reconstructed data, and obtain more high-dimensional abstract features. Then, combined with the Convolutional Neural Network, the features are further extracted and dimensionally reduced. The model can effectively solve the problem that the shallow network structure can not fully extract image features and train the model with a small number of samples. In this paper, CK+, FER2013 and Oulu-CASIA databases are used for Cross-Validation of the model. The experimental results show that the model has achieved good results in both databases.

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) in recent decades, developments in smart sensing and actuating technologies have been adopted for the environment. As such, interactions between humans and the environment have become more synergetic and efficient, creating so-called “smart environments”. In recent years, smart environments, such as smart homes, smart farms and smart cities, have matured at an increasing rate. Therefore, keeping track of applications for smart environments has become an important aspect of research. Although several research efforts have targeted reviewing aspects of smart environments, such as technologies, architectures, and security, a gap is identified. Reviews focusing on approaches using a combination of IoT and ML in smart environments/cities are lacking. In this chapter, a systematic review of the combination of IoT and ML in smart environments is presented. Moreover, a summary of approaches to combine IoT and ML in smart environments is provided.

We compare seven popular machine learning techniques by proposing a different approach that quantifies the relevance of location features in real estate price estimation with high and fine levels of granularity. We take advantage of a newly available open dataset provided by the French government that contains 5 years of historical data of real estate transactions. At a high level of granularity, we obtain important differences regarding the models’ prediction powers between cities with medium and high standards of living (precision differences beyond 70% in some cases). At a low level of granularity, we use geocoding to add precise geographical location features to the machine learning algorithm inputs. We obtain important improvements regarding the models’ forecasting powers relative to models trained without these features (improvements beyond 50% for some forecasting error measures). Our results also reveal that neural networks and random forest techniques particularly outperform other methods when geocoding features are not accounted for, while random forest, adaboost and gradient boosting perform well when geocoding features are considered. For identifying opportunities in the real estate market through real estate price prediction, our results can be of particular interest.

Smart parking is one of the important IoT usage scenarios in urban environments. In this work, we show how to use machine learning methods on Internet of things parking sensors’ data to detect free parking spaces. We have used about 100,000 instances of data from NBPS parking sensors provided by Mobilisis company. These are actual data from parking sensors with a magnetometer deployed all over the world. The data was preprocessed, normalized, and clustered, because temperature has a large effect on the value of the magnetometer. Next, the XGBoost algorithm and different architectures of artificial neural networks were used to predict whether the parking space is free or not. Used machine learning methods achieve better accuracy than the current classic algorithm based on the history data of a particular parking sensor that is currently used in production (Mobilisis smart parking solution).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2380-6_14,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Related algorithms, for example, Multi-Scale-Dilation Net extracts multi-resolution features for fusion, and U-Net fuses features of various scales in the convolution process. The larger the scale of these two algorithms, the greater the weight of the target. This paper hopes to strengthen the characteristics of small-scale targets and proposes the algorithm Deep-Skip Net, which itself is also an encoder-decoder network similar to U-Net, but does not perform full-scale Skip connections. And Skip connection to the smallest two scales to ensure network accuracy. For the original scale, deep-level skip connections are used to retain the effective characteristics of small-scale objects.

Moreover, the production and consumption of different kinds of renewable energy are constantly increasing every year. However, forecasting renewable resources in terms of production and consumption is becoming more vital for the decision-making process in the energy sector. Indeed, the accurate forecasting of renewable energy permits to ensure optimal management of energy.

In sensitivity analysis, the classes of tree hazard are sensitive to three variables which are: soil depth, cracks and cavities, and wind protected, respectively. The results of SVM modeling, with 97.5% classification accuracy, in comparison with MLP (94%) and RBFNN (87.9%), in test samples, introduced TFPM_SVM as an ecological failure hazard assessment model for P. orientalis . Such as other prediction model in urban trees management, TFPM_SVM was developed for urban forest and green spaces managers to assess the hazard of old P. orientalis trees failure for precaution actions planning timely. TFPM_SVM as an environmental decision support system is applicable where the old and hazardous trees could be rehabilitated or removed before any unexpected failure occurs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-021-04972-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In IoT based smart cities, the smart objects (devices) are connected with each other via internet as a backbone. The sensed data by the smart objects are transmitted to the sink for further processing using multi hop communication. The smart cities use the analyzed data to improve their infrastructure, public utilities and they enhance their services by using the IoT technology for the betterment of livelihood of the common people. For IoT based smart cities, waste collection is a prominent issue for municipalities that aim to achieve a clean environment. With a boom in population in urban areas, an increasing amount of waste is generated. A major issue of waste management system is the poor process used in waste collection and segregation. Public bins begin to overflow for a long period before the process of cleaning starts, which is resulting in an accumulation of bacteria causing bad odors and spreading of diseases. In order to overcome this issue, in this paper an IoT based smart predication and monitoring of waste disposal system is proposed which utilizes off-the-shelf components that can be mounted to a bin of any size and measure fill levels. An Arduino microcontroller is employed in the proposed model to interface the infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), weight sensors, and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module is used to monitor the status of bins at predetermined intervals. The proposed system transmits the data using the cluster network to the master module which is connected to the backend via Wi-Fi. As data is collected, an intelligent neural network algorithm namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used which will intelligently learn and predict the upcoming wastage from waste generation patterns. Moreover, the proposed system uses Firebase Cloud Messaging to notify the appropriate people when the bins were full and needed to be emptied. The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) is used to send notification messages in web apps in browsers that provide service work support. Hence, the proposed system is useful to the society by providing facilities to the governments for enforcing stricter regulations for waste disposal. Additional features such as automated calibration of bin height, a dynamic web data dashboard as well as collation of data into a distributed real-time firebase database are also provided in the proposed system.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-021-08897-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, offering a brief overview of the urban planning histories of both Amsterdam and New Amsterdam, or present-day New York City, we then examine how software and hardware innovations in the AV industry could transform citizens’ movement through urban areas and interactions with physical infrastructure. Looking to Amsterdam’s famous canals, we investigate how the development of autonomous vehicles serves as an example of programmable infrastructure that responds in real-time to human behaviour. Following this, we propose how implementing autonomous ridesharing systems in cities could provide opportunities for repurposing present-day automobile infrastructure, i.e., parking.

The development of the financial industry is the fastest and most mature. Now in the transportation field, blockchain technology and big data technology are combined; it can solve some of the pain points in traffic. Blockchain technology is a decentralized technology. Decentralization means that each node in the network is independent of each other and carries out point-to-point information data transmission. In this process, there is no organization or individual pairing and transmission process. Using blockchain technology in traffic scenarios can put information and data on the chain to ensure that information and data will not be tampered with and can be traced back at all times. This article proposes a method to build a big data platform for urban intelligent transportation using blockchain technology. The method takes data as the core, eliminates the centralized computer management of multiple organizations, changes the methods of data collection, data processing and analysis, completes the data storage modules and methods, and realizes the complete platformization of the urban intelligent transportation system. The results show that the urban intelligent transportation big data platform architecture using blockchain technology overcomes the limitations of multiple organizations, discovers urban intelligent transportation data, and further solves the problem of insufficient data in existing network archives.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-8052-6_19,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

High delivery costs, noisy and polluting traffic, bad working conditions and failed delivery attempts could be addressed by measures like AI-based demand forecasting, intelligent tour and route optimization or digital delivery assistance. However, there is little empirical evidence on the extent to which AI can do this. Thus, the purpose of this report is to elaborate the relevance of AI for solving ULML problems by identifying use cases, potentials and challenges of implementing AI in ULML planning and execution. Therefore, we conducted 15 explorative expert interviews with ULML companies and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis to obtain an initial orientation in this new empirical research field. The findings indicate, among others, that the ULML industry is in the very early stages of AI implementation and that there is relevant potential for efficiency and service improvement. However, one of the key challenges is the perceived high level of uncertainty about achieving economic benefits while having high investment and AI operating costs. The practical contribution of this paper is to provide guidance for ULML companies starting AI activities.

However, the prediction that considers some other factors as environmental and weather conditions are considered to be more accurate. Predicting traffic flow is a fascinating research area. To forecast traffic, several different data mining approaches are used. Existing traffic flow forecast approaches are mostly based on shallow traffic prediction methods, which are insufficient for many real-world applications.

To let road users make decisions better and faster, it would be desirable to design an automated software, being a component of an Intelligent Transport System, which offers proper suggestions to the users instantly upon analyzing all available live videos. In this paper, we propose to create a real-time road traffic condition estimation system. Its design is based on a combination of deep learning algorithms: the YOLOv5, DeepSORT, and the Non-Maximum Suppression algorithms. Putting together the YOLOv5 with our proposed two-stage NMS strategy, the improvement on the efficiency of object detection on live videos is noticeable. Our two-stage strategy removes the requirement to manually tune the NMS parameters continuously. With DeepSORT, we are able to track moving vehicles, and create motion trajectories, which we can use filtering strategy to assess the latest road traffic conditions. Since different lanes on a road may have different traffic situations, we separate the lanes based on angles and propose to use a lane status score independently for each lane.

Various researchers have submitted different recommendations for resolving the traffic congestions and for providing optimum routes to travel from a particular origin to the specified destination with less time and less fuel consumption. Historical traffic data has been used in traffic recommendation systems to present optimum travel routes to road users. The process of finding the optimum navigational path for a particular route is the personalization of the transportation system. The personalization makes the transportation into an intelligent transportation system (ITS). The intelligent transportation system stores the frequent traveler’s optimal path to travel from any source to the destination on a particular day at a particular time in the database. The artificial neural network (ANN) is then used for data analysis for making predications in various domains. The optimum path is the path which takes the least travel time with least fuel consumption. The personalized intelligent system assists travelers with the optimum path using the PrefixSpan algorithm.,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-5652-1_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Furthermore, the conventional transportation system also emits other particulate matter into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and associated health issues. Thus, the aforementioned negative consequences of fossil-based transport system make it central to the energy and climate challenge. Therefore, the most practical and sustainable solution for effective mitigation of climate change and energy security concerns is the electrification of the transportation sector – a paradigm shift in the conventional mobility sector. As the electric power system is already in transition and experiencing its own paradigm shift – Smart(er) Grid – “Transportation Electrification” is thus the timely development for introducing a paradigm shift in the mobility sector. The vision of electrified mobility is to lower the environmental footprint of the transportation sector, which further demands the utilization of more renewable energy resource-based generation mix in the electricity grid – “Greener Grid.” Thus, in this chapter, we explain the potential of transportation electrification for reducing the harmful climatic emissions and the nexus of energy and economy with electric mobility. The contrasting narrative of direct and indirect electrification with structural changes is further discussed with implications on cross-sectoral balance.

The meta parameters of this unsupervised machine learning technique are optimized by a genetic algorithm method. Based on the resulting clusters and VI, a linear regression is applied to predict the VI of each district of a city. The weights of each feature used in the clustering are calculated using a random forest regressor algorithm. The results are applied to the city of Trois-Rivières. Each VI is defined using a magnitude of vitality and a cluster that can be used to compare districts. The consistency of the clusters are presented using a Silhouette index (SI).

Although national level political, administrative, juridical institutions opened up local national markets through privatization, deregulation, intellectual property rights, and free trade laws, regulations and agreements; the regulatory deficiencies in creating local economic incentives and voluntary initiatives through strategic relational corporate laws, and the foreign ownership of the core productive means, in contradiction, have served a globalized techno-nationalism. Firstly, hit by the financial crisis, the competition among anti-competitive state aid-backed technologies ascended in the world market and caused degeneration in the implementation of competition laws, which is extended to trade laws, and thus foreign policies, hence the discussions for the populist relocation of production, techno-nationally advancing artificial intelligence and big data applications. These incompetent competition and trade laws and regulations for techno-nationalist products and services pave the way for the generic wage stagnation, thickening the gender-based wage differentials, as well as the CO_2-embedded trade imports for high income and CO_2 embedded exports for middle-income countries in the midst of democracy versus development debates.

By proposing a network of regulatory intelligence against the rise of populism at city level, techno-nationalist artificial intelligence and big data strategies without humanities knowledge, growing climate catastrophe markets for multinational companies and countries as an outcome of ongoing climate crime, and stiffening gender-based wage gap and basic income debates, this chapter offers a meta-governance framework for network of regulatory intelligence and transformative laws and regulations for sharing financing, data, knowledge, and power within and among cities to create and enable novel economic incentives and voluntary initiatives for self-organization and determination for individuals, connected cities and communities, and global societal political economic sustainability.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-92620-5_6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Municipalities used to have several competences and responsibilities either in the use of resources and the provision of (social) services to citizens. Usually they hold a huge amount of data and experiences that can be used to provide better planning of their responsibilities to citizens. Cities abstract social behaviour for regeneration and distribution in two aspects: i) those related to the interaction of individuals inside big communities, basically cities, and the global beneficials obtained by social services and solidarity, and ii) the social relationship of these communities (cities and citizens) with nature, in the sense of intertwining with sustainability and reasonable use of (natural) resources. In [ 9 ], Dahl proposed and justified Doughnut Computing , an AI methodology based on inferential programming that, using the Doughnut Economics model as a compass [ 21 ]), can help us achieve, both locally and globally, the goal of enabling social and ecological well-being. In this paper, we discuss how to specialize this methodology, always guided by the human and sustainability goals of Doughnut economics, to analize cities’ social behaviour as communities in order to perform planning of municipal services to improve social relations, sustainability and quality of life.

Alternatively, one can design a dynamic policy to update the schedule according to the state of the network. Using such policy, any dynamic changes in demand, travel times, traffic, geometry, or emergency modes will be reflected in the real-time scheduling. In this study, the application of reinforcement learning for public transportation scheduling and routing is proposed considering electric vehicles. Reinforcement learning is a right choice for online decision-making in a time-variant setting. Reflecting electric vehicles’ characteristics on public transportation scheduling supports the necessity of considering a dynamic scheduling policy, such as vehicle-to-grid transaction capability or dynamic charging strategies. The proposed scheduling methodology is evaluated for a customary six-stop network. The trained agent takes actions based on the number of waiting people, the drop-off requests, battery level, time, and the current location. The assumed models for the traffic load effect, the passenger flow per stops, and the electricity price add nonlinearity to the problem in which this algorithm will behave more conveniently compared to a fixed schedule setting. Using this method, the electric bus can choose the next destination, the optimal driving speed for each interval, and the amount of electricity to charge or to sell for optimal financial gain when connected to the charging infrastructure. The proposed environment is built numerically, and a learning-based agent is trained for this purpose. Our study supports that the optimal dynamic agent outperforms a fixed schedule policy in different modes of network performance, particularly, when the network undergoes abrupt demand changes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76004-5_31,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Human to human interaction is the most prolific method of transmission of this virus. Nations all across the globe started to issue stay at home orders and mandating to wear masks or a form of face-covering in public to minimize the transmission by reducing contact between majority of the populace. The epidemiological models used in the literature have considerable drawbacks in the assumption of homogeneous mixing among the populace. Moreover, the effect of mitigation strategies such as mask mandate and stay at home orders cannot be efficiently accounted for in these models. In this work, we propose a novel data driven approach using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network model to form a functional mapping of daily new confirmed cases with mobility data which has been quantified from cell phone traffic information and mask mandate information. With this approach no pre-defined equations are used to predict the spread, no homogeneous mixing assumption is made, and the effect of mitigation strategies can be accounted for. The model learns the spread of the virus based on factual data from verified resources. A study of the number of cases for the state of New York (NY) and state of Florida (FL) in the USA are performed using the model. The model correctly predicts that with higher mobility the cases would increase and vice-versa. It further predicts the rate of new cases would see a decline if a mask mandate is administered. Both these predictions are in agreement with the opinions of leading medical and immunological experts. The model also predicts that with the mask mandate option even a higher mobility would reduce the daily cases than lower mobility without masks. We additionally generate results and provide RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) comparison with ARIMA based model of other published work for Italy, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Japan, and the UK. Our model reports lower RMSE than the ARIMA based work for all eight countries which were tested. The proposed model would provide administrations with a quantifiable basis of how mobility, mask mandates are related to new confirmed cases; so far no epidemiological models provide that information. It gives fast and relatively accurate prediction of the number of cases and would enable the administrations to make informed decisions and make plans for mitigation strategies and changes in hospital resources.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10489-021-02381-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since the yellow signal lasts only 3 s, an improper decision will result in major accidents before it turns red. Back-end crashes and crossing of intersections result from sudden stops, resulting in a red-light violation, and/or it might end with a right-angle crash. Understanding the driver’s driving behaviour when it is in the dilemma zone approaching the signalized intersection and then continuing by classifying the outcome of the driving behaviour (safe stopping and unsafe stopping) is this study's main motive. The car's parameters and the driver's driving behaviour parameters are captured using a driving simulator. The simulated test environment is designed to span rural, suburban, and urban roads to mimic the real-life scenarios and understand the driver’s driving behaviour in different environments. The driver’s behaviour is classified using different machine learning approaches, SVM and KNN. The categorization of 60 instances is recognized by the 70%–30% rule used for training and testing data, resulting in the inaccuracy of 88.1% for SVM and 72.1%, and KNN is 83.3% and 61.1%, respectively. The classification performance gave 89.6% (SVM-training), 91.6% (SVM-testing), 85.4% (KNN-training), and 66.6% (KNN-testing) for five cross-validations and 30 iterations using random sampling.

However, models capable of predicting specific crimes, such as homicide, are not commonly found in the current literature. This research presents a machine learning model to predict homicide crimes, using a dataset that uses generic data (without study location dependencies) based on incident report records for 34 different types of crimes, along with time and space data from crime reports. Experimentally, data from the city of Belém - Pará, Brazil was used. These data were transformed to make the problem generic, enabling the replication of this model to other locations. In the research, analyses were performed with simple and robust algorithms on the created dataset. With this, statistical tests were performed with 11 different classification methods and the results are related to the prediction’s occurrence and non-occurrence of homicide crimes in the month subsequent to the occurrence of other registered crimes, with 76% assertiveness for both classes of the problem, using Random Forest.

Specifically, the industrial regions in and around India contribute a major part in the depletion of air quality in the south Asian region. Further, air pollution plays a vital role on the harmful diseases in the metropolises in India. The pollutant levels have been monitored in real-time to initiate the control measures to keep the air quality index (AQI) in the satisfactory level. Some of the major pollutants are particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM 10), sulfur dioxide (SO_2), nitrogen dioxide (NO_2), ozone (O_3), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH_3). With the evolution of technology, it is possible to predict the future air quality using various machine learning (ML) techniques. In the present work, the air quality data of major industrialized cities such as Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow have been collected for the past five years (2015–2019) and predictive models are built. The prediction accuracy of traditional ML–models such as decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB) is compared with new hybrid models such as LR + DT and GB + DT. The predicted data are compared with the actual data of the subsequent years. The performance of the regression models is evaluated through mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient ( r ). The hybrid models have proven efficiency while compared to the traditional methods in prediction of air quality of the subsequent years. Consequently, the health statistics (death rate) released by Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is correlated with air pollution-based diseases. The presented ML-based work can be used in real-time to predict the future air pollution for the better planning and control of the air pollution-based diseases around the globe.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-96429-0_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Information about residential buildings, for example, the number of residents, is used in the inventory and digitization of the urban economy and subsequently becomes the basis of digital platforms for managing urban processes. Inventory of urban property can be carried out independently by different departments within the framework of official functions, which leads to the problem of conflicting information and missing values in urban data, in building data in particular. These problems are especially pronounced when information from different sources is combined to create centralized repositories and digital twins of the city. This leads to the need to develop approaches to filling missing values and correcting distorted information about residential buildings.

AI tries to break the barrier between human and robots as an expert machine. Artificial Intelligence is useful in order to save time and increase the productivity of work. AI automates routine tasks which were previously performed by human beings, consequently, the cost of hiring human resource is decreased. Furthermore, with the help of AI, such machines can be developed which will be much faster and smarter than human beings. The idea of modern AI was first presented by John McCarthy in Dartmouth conference in 1956. The first golden years of AI from 1956 to 1974 were at that time when AI was considered quite interesting and a hot topic for researchers and it was believed to be good investment, time and money. However, at the end of 1974 the first winter of AI was started, it was considered that AI is not as such of great progress rather wastage of time and money. Afterwards, another rebirth of AI from 1980 to 1987 took place with the knowledge about the expert systems. In 1997, a supercomputer named as Deep blue was created on the basis of AI. After that DARPA Grand Challenge in March 2004, it was about an autonomous vehicle drive through uncharted terrain by itself for hundred miles that vehicle was also working on AI. Hence, transportation system started using Artificial Intelligence. With AI being part of the system, congestion, accidents can be controlled, predict future moves (e.g., RATP dev AI engine works on it). In addition, AI is used for scheduling and routing, applying higher and lower traffic patterns. In ITS specifically in VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) there are two modes of communications V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2I (vehicle to infrastructure). AI is also used in Swiss Federal Railways and Tesla self-driving cars. According to UITP’s survey it is stated that 62% of public transport players are involved in Artificial Intelligence projects and 86% are engaged in partnership to develop and adopt AI.

Due to the cost and disruptions to physical infrastructures, network emulators, such as Mininet, are often used to generate measurements needed to estimate throughput profiles, typically expressed as a function of the connection round trip time. The profiles estimated using measurements from such emulated networks are usually inaccurate for high bandwidth and high latency connections, since they do not accurately reflect the critical network transport dynamics mainly due to computing and memory constraints of the host. We present a machine learning (ML) method to estimate the throughput profiles using emulation measurements to closely match the testbed and production network profiles. In particular, we propose a micro Kernel Network (mKN) that provides baseline throughput measurements on the host running Mininet emulations, which are used to learn a regression map that converts them to the corresponding testbed measurement estimates. Once initially learned, this map is applied to measurements from subsequent network emulations on the same host. We present experimental measurements to illustrate this approach, and derive generalization equations for the proposed mKN-ML method. Using a four-site scenario emulation, we show the effectiveness of this method in providing accurate concave throughput profiles from inaccurate convex or non-smooth ones indicated by Mininet emulation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-98978-1_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Remote sensing based AGB estimate is an excellent solution for regional scale. Urban trees play an important part in carbon cycling because they sequester carbon. Above Ground Biomass (AGB) quantification is thus critical for better understanding the function of urban trees in carbon sequestration. This work was carried out for geospatial modelling of AGB and carbon with the aid of field-based data and their correlations with spectra and textural variables derived from Landsat-8 OLI data for urban forests in Jodhpur city, Rajasthan, India, using a Random Forest (RF) based machine learning (ML) approach. A total of 198 variables were retrieved from the satellite image including bands, Vegetation Indices (VIs), linearly transformed variables and Grey Level Co-occurrence textures (GLCM) were taken as independent input variables for RF regression.

This paper presents a method using SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU individually to detect drivers’ actions from statistical numeric data where LSTM performs better. A public dataset that uses numeric sequential data to predict driver's behavioral conditions. This paper also compares the proposed DBA algorithm with previously used deep learning and machine learning models to detect driver actions by accuracy and precision. After many epochs, the paper concludes that the LSTM model yields greater success than most other models and achieves 0.961 accuracies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-5348-3_16,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

So, on one hand, we have to fulfill our requirements by using resources in an optimized manner, and on the other hand, we are currently in a pandemic for which social distancing is the key to prevent ourselves from the COVID-19 virus. We all travel by bus, train, metros, and other public transports, and we all have faced the problem of overcrowding in public transport once in our life especially during any festive season when there is a lot of rush among people to go from their workplace to their hometown. The problem of overcrowding is very common in developing countries like India where the population is relatively higher than the number of seats in public transports. For instance, if we look at the Delhi metro in which it is almost impossible to travel during the festive season. However, it’s a regular problem, but the crowd becomes more when any festive season approaches. And due to such rush, people tend to just get inside the metro without even searching for a relatively less crowded or vacant seat/compartment, resulting in an unusual pattern of density seen across the metro, somewhere empty and somewhere highly crowded that even no place to stand. And now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation worsens, on one hand, we are bound to travel in-crowd for work and on the other hand, we have to maintain social distancing for COVID prevention. So it becomes almost impossible to travel through such public transport. To solve such problems we are proposing a solution, that is, a system that takes care of the public places/transports by scanning and informing passengers where they can move to find a seat or less crowded. It also helps to ensure social distancing in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2164-2_36,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The cornea is avascular, meeting its oxygen requirements largely from the atmosphere by diffusion across the tear film and epithelium; conversely, it derives most of its additional nutritional requirements from the aqueous humor arising from across the corneal endothelium. The epithelium of the cornea provides the major barrier to tear-borne pathogens, while the corneal endothelium is principally responsible for maintaining the hydration and clarity of the corneal stroma. As the highest refractive power in the optics of the eye, subtle variations in corneal curvature lead to higher order aberrations that can be assessed with corneal topography. Measured with instruments that analyze reflected patterns from the tear film, variations of the Placido disk permit the most sensitive assessments of corneal optical properties. These data form the basis for the color-coded contour map display of corneal curvature, permitting clinical diagnosis of a wide variety of corneal pathologies as well as evaluation and development of refractive surgical procedures.

However, one of the major challenges is to define a proper way to “sweep”filters through the point cloud as a natural generalization of the planar convolution and to reflect the point cloud’s geometry at the same time. In this paper, we consider generalizing convolution by adapting parallel transport on the point cloud. Inspired by a triangulated surface-based method [ 46 ], we propose the Narrow-Band Parallel Transport Convolution (NPTC) using a specifically defined connection on a voxel-based narrow-band approximation of point cloud data. With that, we further propose a deep convolutional neural network based on NPTC (called NPTC-net) for point cloud classification and segmentation. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed NPTC-net achieves similar or better results than current state-of-the-art methods on point cloud classification and segmentation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10915-021-01699-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Supervised learning algorithms minimize the out-of-sample prediction error in the parental income imputation and provide an objective criterion for choosing across different specifications of the first-stage equation.

Therefore, in emergency management, we need to be timely in predicting urban floods. Although the existing machine learning models can quickly predict the depth of stagnant water, these models only target single points and require large amounts of measured data, which are currently lacking. Although numerical models can accurately simulate and predict such events, it takes a long time to perform the associated calculations, especially two-dimensional large-scale calculations, which cannot meet the needs of emergency management. Therefore, this article proposes a method of coupling neural networks and numerical models that can simulate and identify areas at high risk from urban floods and quickly predict the depth of water accumulation in these areas. Taking a drainage area in Tianjin Municipality, China, as an example, the results show that the simulation accuracy of this method is high, the Nash coefficient is 0.876, and the calculation time is 20 seconds.

In this study, Naive Bayes (NB) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm were used to forecast the waterlogging point and the waterlogging process at the waterlogging point respectively to achieve the goal of predicting the whole process of urban waterlogging.

In this study, a novel calculation method using correlation coefficients was introduced. First, models of three neural network algorithms, namely, back propagation neural network (BPNN), grey model neural network (GMNN), and generalised regression neural network (GRNN), were constructed. Key attention was given to improvement of the BPNN. The correlation laws of different influencing factors in a region and the CLA were discovered and extracted using these three models. The coefficient of determination and coefficient of variation were applied to verify the validity of the simulation results for each neutral network algorithm model. The mean absolute error and root mean square error of the three algorithm models were calculated to select the neutral network algorithm model with the highest accuracy. Subsequently, the mean impact value algorithm was added to the selected algorithm model to calculate the weight coefficients for the different relevant factors. The calculated results were compared with the weight values of influencing factors, which were calculated using the analytic hierarchy process, thus forming a set of calculation methods for a more accurate judgement of the influencing factors and weight coefficients of CLA. In this study, the correlations between the influencing factors and CLA were calculated using the proposed method via a case study.

The hospitalization costs were also be calculated. MLP and RBF neural networks have been tested by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the type of equation of the output function. The following pollutants and its concentration range were collected considering the supervision of Alto Tiete station set, in several neighborhoods in the city of São Paulo, from in the period 2011 to 2017: 28–63 µg/m^3 of PM_2.5, 52–110 µg/m^3 of PM_10, 49–135 µg/m^3 of O_3, 0.8–2.6 ppm CO, 41–98 µg/m^3 of NO_2, and 3–16 µg/m^3 of SO_2.

The system employs an end-to-end approach for identifying, locating, and classifying vehicles in the images. The pre-trained Tiny-YOLOv3 network is adopted as the main reference model and subsequently pruned and simplified by training on the BIT-vehicle dataset, and excluding some of the unnecessary layers.

Five commonly used stochastic optimization methods: genetic algorithm, global search algorithm, multiple starting point algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, and pattern search algorithm, are employed to optimize the RBNN. Flow of a non-Newtonian third-grade fluid through two parallel plates, subjected to uniform heat flux, is considered. At first, governing equations, describing the flow and heat transfer problem, are solved by the least-square method, a semi-analytical tool. The velocity and the temperature profiles are obtained for different values of third-grade fluid parameter ‘A’, which are then used for training different stochastic optimization method-assisted RBNNs (SOMARBNNs). For proper functioning of RBNN, a suitable value for an important attribute called ‘spread’ is required. Deciding the value for ‘spread’ requires experience and knowledge of neural networks. The present approach makes the selection of proper value of ‘spread’ very easy, and beginners can use the RBNN for problem-solving. With the help of different stochastic optimization methods, the value of spread for the RBNN is determined. Once all SOMARBNNs are trained, the temperature profile and the corresponding third-grade fluid parameter ‘A’ are obtained as output, corresponding to any new velocity profile fed as input. Further, the data for training are perturbed by different levels of noise, and different SOMARBNNs are successfully employed to get the output. The performance evaluation of different SOMARBNNs is carried out in terms of CPU time and error in result. The results indicate that PSAARBNN is better than other SOMARBNNs, as it is able to generate results with high accuracy for both low noise data and high noise data. Moreover, the CPU time requirement by PSAARBNN is lowest.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-021-05702-8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Secondly, we use a particle filter (PF) as the tracker to implement the preliminary multi-object tracking.

Future urbanization might be directed along several development typologies, e.g. sprawling urbanization, more compact cities, greener cities, or a combination of different typologies. These developments induce urban land-use change that will affect urban climate and might reinforce phenomena such as the urban heat island and thermal discomfort of urban residents. A planning-based mitigation approach to ensure thermal comfort of residents are urban cold-air paths, i.e. low-roughness areas enabling drainage and transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings. We study how urban land-use change scenarios influence cold-air path occurrence probability and spatial distribution in a mid-European city using a machine learning approach, i.e. boosted regression trees. The Urban Sprawl Scenario results in the strongest reduction of cold-air path area by 3.6% in comparison to the reference case. The Green City Scenario gives evidence for an increase of cold-air path area (2.2%) whereas the Compact Green City Scenario partly counteracts the negative influence of urban densification by increased fractions of vegetated areas.

Two parts of this problem, namely new constructions and rapid reaction, have made this as a daunting topic. Although the numerical methods can provide precise predictions, their applicability due to the above-mentioned issues is challenging as one has to redo the computations when new buildings are added. In this paper, thus, a deep learning model is developed to efficiently predict the spatiotemporal distribution of debris flow as it interacts with different building arrangements. As such, we employed U-net as the base model, which is combined with the residual network to alleviate the gradient vanishing issue. An autoregressive strategy is proposed to help the model capture the dynamics of the debris flow, where the output at the previous timestep is used as the input to predict the current timestep. A synthetic dataset based on the numerical methods is used to train the residual U-net model. The results indicate that the proposed method can predict the general trend at different timesteps, and its robustness is verified using an extensive sensitivity analysis.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-021-06197-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A case study is analysed: the impact of a protocol that sets traffic restrictions on NO_2 levels in Madrid’s urban area. The protocol specifies that these restrictions are active only when NO_2 level reaches above a certain threshold. Since the protocol was first enacted, in 2017, restrictions have only been active for 59 days, never longer than ten consecutive days. Cross effects are identified: the protocol magnifies the effect of other relevant features, especially wind speed. Pollution decreases with wind speed. Consequently, episodes of high pollution levels generally occur when wind speed is low. The analysis shows that precisely at these low values of wind speed, an increase in the wind speed has a higher effect on pollution when the protocol is activated than when it is not. The analysis is carried out at a measuring station level, considering eight representative stations. The referred cross effect is clearer at centrally located stations across Madrid.

We address this gap using a machine learning (ML) approach to study whether street-level built environment visuals can be used to classify locations with high-crime and lower-crime activities. For training the ML model, spatialized expert narratives are used to label different locations. Semantic categories (e.g., road, sky, greenery, etc.) are extracted from Google Street View (GSV) images of those locations through a deep learning image segmentation algorithm. From these, local visual representatives are generated and used to train the classification model. The model is applied to two cities in the U.S. to predict the locations as being linked to high crime. Results show our model can predict high- and lower-crime areas with high accuracies (above 98% and 95% in first and second test cities, accordingly).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s42001-021-00107-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to grid images of a city and predict five density classes of university graduates at a micro level (250 m × 250 m grid size). The CNN reaches an accuracy rate of 40.5% (random approach: 20%). Furthermore, the accuracy increases to 78.3% when considering a one-class deviation compared to the true class. We also examine the predictability of inhabited and uninhabited grid cells, where we achieve an accuracy of 95.3% using the same CNN. From this, we conclude that there is information that correlates with graduate density that can be derived by analysing only satellite images. The findings show the high potential of computer vision for urban and regional economics. Particularly in data-poor regions, the approach utilised facilitates comparative analytics and provides a possible solution for the modifiable aerial unit (MAU) problem.

In this respect, the strategic configuration of BHs plays a crucial role in saving supply costs, covering demand, and minimizing the external effects of Shared Passenger and Freight Public Transportation (SPFPT). As urban areas become crowded, they show a significant increase in congestion and transport demand. Thus, sites where logistic operations, sales, or services are likely to occur, imply the final customers whose transport demand is a key factor that could affect cargo distribution using SPFPT systems. Since each BH should help efficiently to satisfy the transport demand of allocated customers, they would not play their key role if such factor of demand is not involved upstream in the long-term scheduling horizon. This paper focuses on locating BHs, using a Hybrid Robust Machine Learning-Heuristic Algorithm (HR-MLHA), among established ones and existing demand nodes while assessing a dynamic process so that the configured BH network is robust. The feature of robustness is supported by a robust command to keep BHs attractive and demand-responsive for the long-term in dynamic environments, i.e., the cities. To reduce complexity, the conceptual and computational approaches are structured in two main axes. The first axis includes a machine-learning-based zoning approach that helps with targeting the implementation area and assessing demand behavior. The second axis presents a mathematical model of the capacitated two-echelon BH location problem. When looking across the two-echelon location process, we aim at conducting dynamic location analysis using both current and predicted demand. In order to validate our approach, a set of benchmarks has been performed comparing with existing heuristics and using a whole package of experimental and real-life instances. The experimental results provided through the proposed approach have allowed valuable insights into successfully implementing our methodology.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11135-021-01263-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The characteristics of rivers and sediment in the tropical region are different compared to those of the rivers in Europe and the USA, where the median sediment size tends to be much more refined. The origins of the rivers are mainly tropical forests. Due to the complexity of determining sediment transport, many sediment transport equations were recommended in the literature. However, the accuracy of the prediction results remains low, particularly for the tropical rivers. The majority of the existing equations were developed using multiple non-linear regression (MNLR). Machine learning has recently been the method of choice to increase model prediction accuracy in complex hydrological problems. Compared to the conventional MNLR method, machine learning algorithms have advanced and can produce a useful prediction model. In this research, three machine learning models, namely evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) and M5 tree model (M5P), were implemented to model sediment transport for rivers in Malaysia. The formulated variables for the prediction model were originated from the revised equations reported in the relevant literature for Malaysian rivers. Among the three machine learning models, in terms of different statistical measurement criteria, EPR gives the best prediction model, followed by MGGP and M5P. Machine learning is excellent at improving the prediction distribution of high data values but lacks accuracy compared to observations of lower data values.

The capital expenditure (CapEx) linked at the planning stage to this type of public asset is strongly connected to the quantity of tunnels and viaducts planned. In this context, for similar lengths, a railway line using 15% tunnels and 7% viaducts to link two cities should not have the same financial viability as one using 8% tunnels and 3% viaducts to link the same cities. The process of planning, design and construction of linear works is heavily scrutinised by public administrations in all countries, and in many cases similar standards of work are shared. Firstly, this research paper highlights the existence of hidden geometric patterns in all linear transport infrastructures worldwide. Secondly, it proposes to exploit the existence of such patterns for the benefit of planners through the computational power available today in machine learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) platforms. This article demonstrates how geometric features extracted from any succession of rectangular trapeziums in linear infrastructures can predict the quantity of kilometres in ‘surface’, ‘tunnel’ and ‘viaduct’ sections in future linear rail transport infrastructures that have not yet been built. The practical application of the proposed working methodology has made it possible to intuit the characteristics of a future Hyperloop transport network in Europe of more than 12,000 km in length.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40864-021-00149-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Creating a higher degree of communication in automobiles results in the time wastage, fuel wastage, environmental damage, and even death caused by citizens being trapped in the middle of traffic. Only a few researchers work in traffic congestion prediction and control systems, but it may provide less accuracy. So, this paper proposed an efficient IoT-based traffic prediction using OWENN algorithm and traffic signal control system using Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. The proposed system consists of ‘5’ phases, namely IoT data collection, feature extraction, classification, optimized traffic IoT values, and traffic signal control system. Initially, the IoT traffic data are collected from the dataset. After that, traffic, weather, and direction information are extracted, and these extracted features are given as input to the OWENN classifier, which classifies which place has more traffic. Suppose one direction of the place has more traffic, it optimizes the IoT values by using IBSO, and finally, the traffic is controlled by using Intel 80,286 microprocessor. An efficient OWENN algorithm for traffic prediction and traffic signal control using a Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. After extracting the features, the classification is performed in this step. Hereabout, the classification is done by using the optimized weight Elman neural network (OWENN) algorithm that classifies which places have more traffic. OWENN attains 98.23% accuracy than existing model also its achieved 96.69% F-score than existing model.

The support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify LULC maps over the years 1990–2018, and their dynamics were examined using delta change and a Markovian transitional probability matrix (TPM). From 1990 to 2018, the ESV was calculated for each LULC type using a coefficient. An artificial neural network-cellular automata model was used to predict the future LULC map for 2028. Sensitivity analysis has been performed using the probability distribution function, Pearson’s correlation methods, random forest, and classification and regression tree. Future LULC was used to derive future ESV from different ecosystems. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas rose by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. Delta change rate showed that urban areas have increased by 16.34% since 1990, while the TPM for the period of 1990–2018 reported that the built-up area was the largest stable LULC with a TPM value of 83.6%, while agricultural land, scrubland, exposed rocks, and water bodies were converted by 17.9%, 21.8%, 12.4%, and 10.5%, respectively, into built-up areas. Due to the accelerated and continuous urbanization process, all-natural resources and ecosystem services have been diminished considerably except for dense vegetation.

However, counting passengers in highly crowded scenes is a challenging task due to their random movement, diverse appearance settings and inter-object occlusions. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods in this domain rely heavily on additional custom cameras or sensors instead of existing onboard surveillance cameras, which consequently limits the feasibility of such systems for large-scale deployment. Hence, this paper puts forward an enhanced appearance descriptor with lateral movement compensation, which addresses the difficulty in counting passengers bidirectionally in cluttered scenes. We first construct a head re-identification dataset, which is used to train an appearance descriptor. This dataset addresses the absence of a person re-identification dataset, which in turn allows for accurate tracking of passengers in cluttered scenes. Then, a novel technique of applying a fedora counting line is introduced to count the number of passengers entering and exiting a bus. This technique compensates the impact of passengers’ lateral movement, which crucially increases the accuracy of bidirectional passenger counting using onboard bus surveillance cameras. In addition, a real-time implementation of the proposed method, which includes the integration of DeepStream and fedora counting line, is also presented. Experimental results on a challenging test dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmarked techniques with an average counting accuracy of 93.21% for entering and 96.10% for exiting public buses.

The pollution of air is one of the significant problems to be resolved as it restricted the ecological transformation of the modernized ecosystem. Therefore, it is fundamental to evaluate the implication of these ecological issues to enhance the urban ecosystem. This vital purpose of this research is to propose a canonical correlation analysis based hyper basis feedforward neural network classification (CCA-HBFNNC) model for evaluating sustainable urban environmental quality. The CCA-HBFNNC model initially acquires a large size of U.S. air pollution dataset as input. Then, a canonical correlative analysis based feature selection algorithm is applied in the CCA-HBFNNC model to select the key pollutant features, which bear fundamental implications to the modernize air pollution to maintain the level of urban sustainability. After the feature selection process, the CCA-HBFNNC model applies the HYPER BASIS FEEDFORWARD NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFICATION (HBFNNC) algorithm in order to classify input air data based on chosen pollutants features. During the classification process, the HBFNNC algorithm used three critical layers namely hidden, output and input layers for efficiently categorizing each input data as higher or lower pollution level with higher accuracy. If the level of air pollution on the urban environment is higher, finally CCA-HBFNNC model significantly reduces the pollution level. In this way, the CCA-HBFNNC model attains improved urban sustainability levels when compared to sophisticated operation. An experimental evaluation of the CCA-HBFNNC model is determined in terms of CCA-HBFNNC model, time complexity and false-positive rate in consideration of the diversified number of air data retrieved from the big data sets.

Our study objective is to develop a generic approach to predict how often different disruption types occur at different stations of a public transport network, and to predict the impact related to these disruptions as measured in terms of passenger delays. We propose a supervised learning approach to perform these predictions, as this allows for predictions for individual stations for each time period, without the requirement of having sufficient empirical disruption observations available for each location and time period. This approach also enables a fast prediction of disruption impacts for a large number of disruption instances, hence addressing the computational challenges that rise when typical public transport assignment or simulation models would be used for real-world public transport networks. To improve transferability of our study results, we cluster stations based on their contribution to network vulnerability using unsupervised learning. This supports public transport agencies to apply the appropriate type of measure aimed to reduce disruptions or to mitigate disruption impacts for each station type. Applied to the Washington metro network, we predict a yearly passenger delay of 5.9 million hours for the total metro network. Based on the clustering, five different types of station are distinguished. Stations with high train frequencies and high passenger volumes located at central trunk sections of the network show to be most critical, along with start/terminal and transfer stations. Intermediate stations located at branches of a line are least critical.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11116-020-10109-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper analyzes V2V connectivity dynamics by designing the microscopic mobility and lane changing decision model using an adaptive cursive control mechanism and recurrent neural network. Extensive simulators like SUMO and NS2 analyze the validity of this proposed model. The proposed analytical model provides a framework for examining the impact of mobility dependent metrics such as vehicle velocity, acceleration/deceleration, safety gap, vehicle arrival rate, vehicle density and network metric data delivery rate for characterizing the VANET connectivity of the proposed network.

The rapid expansion of the industrial application scale and the sharp increase of data generated by an industrial application and cloud computing have promoted the birth and development of cloud computing platform technology. Data analysis has become an important support for company decision-making; how to quickly and effectively extract useful information from large data sets is very important. Among them, clustering analysis and computer neural network algorithms are the most important methods of data mining. Due to the limitations of computer performance and programming models, traditional data mining methods cannot meet the efficiency and computing needs of a large amount of information. The development of cloud computing technology has opened up a new research field of cloud mining clustering analysis and neural network algorithm formation. The first research is the deployment of the Hadoop cluster based on Linux, and the novelty lies in the parallelization of the MapReduce cluster algorithm. Because there are many clustering algorithms, this paper starts with the K-means clustering algorithm and optimizes the earlier algorithm according to the MapReduce programming model. Through the text clustering process of wine data set in the UCI database, the parallel algorithm is applied to the Hadoop cloud computing platform. Experiments show that the parallel K-means clustering algorithm in MapReduce can significantly improve the execution speed.

Some firms are located close to wealthy neighborhoods and far from competitors, but other firms do not enjoy these advantages. The probability that a household selects a certain firm to patronize depends on that firm’s price and its distance from the household. The firms have almost no information about the urban market they inhabit, but they can experiment with prices and learn what actions lead to higher profits. Firms that experience persistent losses go out of business. When transportation costs are low, households shop aggressively and the result that emerges resembles perfect competition. When transportation costs are high, households shop less aggressively, which gives firms greater market power. The results here more closely resemble monopolistic competition, with more firms surviving, higher prices and higher profits. However, this collusion is implicit, as there is no mechanism for the firms to communicate or explicitly collude with each other. I validate the model by conducting a Probit analysis of the factors that determine firm survival. I also conduct an econometric analysis of the factors that determine a firm’s price, quantity sold, and profit. Firms locating close to rival have a higher probability of going out of business. If these firms do survive, on average their profits are no different than the profits of firms that are not located close to a rival.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11403-021-00332-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, while the city is developing rapidly, there are also problems of thermal environment. The most important part of solving the current environmental problems in the city is to strengthen the greening in the city. The solution of economic problems in the environment can promote the coordinated development of the city, thereby improving economic efficiency. The strength of the urban heat island has a certain relationship with the greening of the city. When the green area of the city is large, the heat island effect in the city is low, and the two are in a negative correlation. In the center of the city, the degree of economic development is relatively high, and people in areas with little land and little money are unwilling to use land where they cannot generate economic benefits. Therefore, vegetation coverage should be increased in urban centers, especially by planting some trees on both sides of the road to reduce the heat island effect. Planning for the urban environment should pay attention to the following two aspects: Firstly, for other types of land use, scientific planning should be done and the land should be used rationally. Secondly, in order to make the urban green space construction more systematic and the layout more reasonable, in the construction process, the various areas should be united to form a whole, so as to make the layout more reasonable and scientific. In this article, the author judges the surface temperature of the city by improving the neural network based on the data in the satellite remote sensing image. In the planning of the future environment of the green city, the author compared different evaluation systems in order to obtain more accurate results, mainly the two evaluation systems of statistical data and remote sensing data.

People’s social behavior, reflected in their mobility data, plays a major role in spreading the disease. Therefore, we used the daily mobility data aggregated at the county level beside COVID-19 statistics and demographic information for short-term forecasting of COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. The daily data are fed to a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks. A significant average correlation was achieved ( r =0.83 ( p = 0.005 )) between the model predicted and actual accumulated cases in the interval from August 1, 2020 until January 22, 2021. The model predictions had r > 0.7 for 87% of the counties across the United States. A lower correlation was reported for the counties with total cases of <1000 during the test interval. The average mean absolute error (MAE) was 605.4 and decreased with a decrease in the total number of cases during the testing interval. The model was able to capture the effect of government responses on COVID-19 cases. Also, it was able to capture the effect of age demographics on the COVID-19 spread. It showed that the average daily cases decreased with a decrease in the retiree percentage and increased with an increase in the young percentage.

The use of machine learning (ML) methods to spatially assess urban waterlogging susceptibility is critical for reducing the losses caused by such disasters. It is important to select an equal number of positive and negative samples to train binary ML classifiers for evaluation; in most cases, researchers are only able to obtain a relatively small number of historical waterlogging locations (positive samples), which leads to the selection of a limited number of negative samples, further affecting the trained classifiers’ performance. Facing this issue, we proposed an optimized seed spread algorithm (OSSA) that can estimate the potential inundated areas based on the spatial distribution of elevation and natural waters, thereby increasing the number of positive samples. The primary urban area of Guangzhou, China, was selected as the study region, and random forest was selected as the evaluation algorithm. We further employed two ML methods, support vector machine and logistic regression, to verify the quality of the increased positive samples. The results indicate that compared with the original positive samples, the OSSA-based positive samples achieve the highest area under the curve values among the three tested ML methods, indicating that the OSSA can be a suitable approach to increase the number of positive samples for such studies.

Predictive accuracy in data-driven traffic models is reduced when exposed to non-recurring or non-routine traffic events, such as accidents, road closures, and extreme weather conditions. The analytical mining of data from social networks – specifically twitter – can improve urban traffic parameter prediction by complementing traffic data with data representing events capable of disrupting regular traffic patterns reported in social media posts. This paper proposes a deep learning urban traffic prediction model that combines information extracted from tweet messages with traffic and weather information. The predictive model adopts a deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stacked autoencoder (SAE) architecture for multi-step traffic flow prediction trained using tweets, traffic and weather datasets. The model is evaluated on an urban road network in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. The findings from extensive empirical analysis using real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving prediction accuracy when compared to other classical/statistical and machine learning (ML) state-of-the-art models.

Despite various policies and strategies incorporated to increase the reliability and quality of service, public transportation authorities continue to face criticism from commuters largely due to irregularities in bus arrival times, most notably manifested in early or late arrivals. Due to these irregularities, commuters may miss important appointments, wait for too long at the bus stop, or arrive late for work. Therefore, accurate prediction models are needed to build better customer service solutions for transit systems, e.g. building accurate mobile apps for trip planning or sending bus delay/cancel notifications. Prediction models will also help in developing better appointment scheduling systems for doctors, dentists, and other businesses to take into account transit bus delays for their clients. In this paper, we seek to predict the occurrence of arrival time irregularities by mining GPS coordinates of transit buses provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) along with hourly weather data and using this data in machine learning models that we have developed. In our study, we compared the performance of a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) model against four baseline models, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and historical averages. We found that our LSTM model demonstrates the best prediction accuracy. The improved accuracy achieved by the LSTM model may lend itself to its ability to adjust and update the weights of neurons while accounting for long-term dependencies. In addition, we found that weather conditions play a significant role in improving the accuracy of our models. Therefore, we built a prediction model that combines an LSTM model with a Recurrent Neural Network Model (RNN) that focuses on the weather condition. Our findings also reveal that in nearly 37% of scheduled arrival times, buses either arrive early or late by a margin of more than 5 min, suggesting room for improvement in the current strategies employed by transit authorities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12652-020-02507-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, a novel prediction approach is proposed based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to adequately predict the potential of liquefaction in a specific range of soil properties. To this end, a whole set of 100 soil data is collected to calculate the potential of liquefaction via empirical approaches in Tabriz, Iran. Then, the results of the empirical approaches are utilized for data training in an ANN, which is considered as an option to predict liquefaction for the first time in Tabriz. The achieved configuration of the ANN is utilized to predict the liquefaction of 10 other data sets for validation purposes. According to the obtained results, a well-trained ANN is capable of predicting the liquefaction potential through error values of less than 5%, which represents the reliability of the proposed approach.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42452-021-04704-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We consider street context as the inferred usage of the street, based on its buildings and construction, categorized in nine possible labels. The labels define whether the street is residential, commercial or downtown, throughway or not, and other special categories. We apply the analysis to the City of Boston, considering daily trajectories synthetically generated with a model based on call detail records (CDR) and images from Google Street View. Images are categorized both manually and using artificial intelligence (AI). We focus on the city’s four main racial/ethnic demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic and Asian), aiming to characterize the differences in what these groups of people see during their daily activities. Based on daily trajectories, we reconstruct most common paths over the street network. We use street demand (number of times a street is included in a trajectory) to detect each group’s most relevant streets and regions. Based on their street demand, we measure the street context distribution for each group. The inclusion of images allows us to quantitatively measure the prevalence of each context and points to qualitative differences on where that context takes place. Other AI methodologies can further exploit these differences. This approach presents the building blocks to further studies that relate mobile devices’ dynamic records with the differences in urban exposure by demographic groups. The addition of AI-based image analysis to street demand can power up the capabilities of urban planning methodologies, compare multiple cities under a unified framework, and reduce the crudeness of GIS-only mobility analysis.

Now, the artificial neural network has been applied to various fields. It can play its own role in each field, but the neural network is used in the prediction of rainfall water quality. It is still in its infancy. This article studies the artificial neural network and artificial neural network for water quality prediction. The education system is a very complex mechanism. There are also large differences. The height and space of urban rainfall are prone to variability. This will cause floods and flood disasters. It is very dangerous for the city, and it will also seriously affect the development of the city. Therefore, the artificial neural network is very important for the prediction of rainfall water quality. If we can use the artificial neural network to recognize the temporal and spatial variability of urban rainfall, then flood disasters can be prevented in advance. This paper uses a variety of algorithms and conducts many experiments to discover the small-scale temporal and spatial variation of rainfall in a certain city. The declining mental health status of Chinese adolescents is not optimistic. It is mainly manifested in anxiety, emotional instability, negativity, and psychological disorders. After a long period of observation, it has been found that the psychological problems of adolescents are mainly caused by disharmony in interpersonal relationships. Study pressure is high and emotions cannot be relieved. Therefore, we have conducted special research in these areas, hoping to have a further understanding of the development of anxiety and obtain corresponding solutions to effectively alleviate the psychological problems of adolescents.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12517-021-07246-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Techniques are proposed in the literature for analyzing the IVS systems. Existing systems for video analysis, suffer with some limitations. The one of the major limitation is lack of real time response from the surveillance systems. In order to overcome this limitation, an IVS system design is proposed using convolution neural networks.

License plate detection (LPD) is a critical process in automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) that reduces complexity by delimiting the search space for subsequent ALPR stages. It is complicated by unfavourable factors including environmental conditions, occlusion, and license plate variation. As such, it requires training models on substantial volumes of relevant images per use case. In 2018, the new Mercosur standard came in to effect in four South American countries. Access to large volumes of actual Mercosur license plates with sufficient presentation variety is a significant challenge for training supervised models for LPD, thereby adversely impacting the efficacy of ALPR in Mercosur countries. This paper presents a novel license plate embedding methodology for generating large volumes of accurate Mercosur license plate images sufficient for training supervised LPD. We validate this methodology with a deep learning-based ALPR using a convolutional neural network trained exclusively with synthetic data and tested with real parking lot and traffic camera images.

Three years (2013–2015) simulations, at a spatial resolution of 5 km, performed by the Flexible Air quality Regional Model (FARM) were used as predictors, together with other spatial-temporal data, such as population, land-use, surface greenness and road networks, by a ML Random Forest (ML-RF) algorithm to produce daily concentrations at higher resolution (1 km) over the national territory. The evaluation of the adopted integrated approach was based on NO_2 and O_3 observations available from 530 and 293 monitoring stations across Italy, respectively. A good performance for NO_2 and excellent results for O_3 were obtained from the application of the CTM; as for NO_2, the levels at urban traffic stations were not captured by the simulations due to the adopted horizontal resolution and related emissions uncertainties. Performance improvements were achieved with ML-RF predictions, reducing NO_2 underestimation (near zero fractional bias results) and better capturing spatial contrasts. The results obtained in this work were used to support the national exposure assessment and environmental epidemiology studies planned in the BEEP (Big data in Environmental and occupational Epidemiology) project and confirm the potential of machine learning methods to adequately predict air pollutant levels at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

The latter exhibited a negative correlation with air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and sensible heat flux and a positive one with relative humidity and emissions. A linear and an artificial neural network (ANN) model have been developed and validated for short-term modelling of 3-h CO_2 concentrations. The ANN model performed better, with mean bias of 0.58 ppm, root mean square error within 30 ppm, and r ^2=0.49. Data clustering through the self-organized maps allowed to disentangle the role played by emissions and meteorological parameters in influencing CO_2 concentrations. Sensitivity analysis of CO_2 concentrations revealed a primary role played by the meteorological parameters, particularly wind speed. These results highlighted that (i) emission reduction actions at local urban scale should be better tied to actual and expected meteorological conditions and (ii) those actions alone have limited effects (e.g. a 20% emission reduction would result in a 3% CO_2 concentrations reduction).

They have been spoiled by the older generation since they were young. They grew up under the protection of their parents. Most of them are flowers in the greenhouse. Now, they have entered the university, carrying the double expectations of society and family. All these pressures, such as learning knowledge, improving skills, etc., come and make them feel confused. Strong self-esteem, personal resistance, and more or less selfish combination of these factors have a huge impact on the psychology of students in coastal cities. In view of the current situation, this article expounds the importance of mental health education for students in coastal cities, clarifies the current problems and causes of mental health in colleges and universities, and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions to solve these problems. The corresponding drop in seawater temperature is an important thermodynamic index that affects coastal climate. This paper selects the environmental climate data of a given coast at 21 locations on a given coast from 1972 to 2020, combines the intermediate data of ERA, and uses a comprehensive analysis method to study the climatic characteristics of sea fog on a given coast. Two dates in ERA-Interim and ICOADS were used to compare and analyze the spatial distribution of coastal sea temperature field from 1984 to 2018 and the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of coastal marine climate environment. Based on artificial intelligence algorithms, this article successfully optimized the original prediction model and effectively improved the prediction accuracy of the model.

AI is an alternative approach to the classical Modeling Technique (MT). AI technique is developed by the department of computer science which works on the theory of human brain ability. As compared to traditional methods, the AI approach provides a solution to many complex civil engineering problems, especially, in the area of concrete technology, structural health monitoring, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, and structural analysis. In addition to this, AI approach also works on those areas where physical testing is not possible, which ultimately reduces human efforts, time, and cost. The core advantage of using AI technique is that it reduces the errors and provides quick results by quick decision-making (QDM) power. In the field of civil engineering, some of the most frequently used artificial intelligence techniques are machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and pattern recognition (PR). This chapter provides a detailed overview of use of these AI techniques in different aspects/fields of civil engineering starting from the general introduction of AI, and the chapter ends up with the inclusion of all possible areas where use of AI techniques has been widely accepted by the construction team in smart cities to achieve safe, sustainable, precise, and accurate results.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-33-6400-4_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Using the application, citizens will monitor the urban sidewalks and update a crowdsourcing platform with the detected barriers and damages that hinder safe walking, along with their location on a city map. To help users assign the correct type of obstacle, and authorities to assess the urgency, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for barrier and damage recognition is embedded in the application.

Another problem is that because of the above features it is not possible to write an algorithm that will choose the optimal route at each moment of time due to the complexity and variability of the input parameters. An interesting task is the development of software allowing automatic collection of traffic information, and transmission to the input of an adaptive decision-making system for choosing the most correct route. It is therefore proposed to develop an adaptive system based on modern machine learning techniques and genetic algorithms.

In physical experiments, the fluctuation noise can reflect the microscopic properties of the quantum transport system easier than the transport current. In theory, the quantum conditional master equation (QCME) is a very effective method for studying quantum transport process of charge qubits. But, the QCME is an infinite recursive differential equation system that is difficult to solve theoretically. So, we try to solve this problem by combining the requirements of the solution and some advantages of the machine learning algorithms. Firstly, compared the calculation diagram of QCME and recurrent neural network (RNN), the relationship between them was found. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has great advantages in processing time-series data as a typical network of RNN. Secondly, the behavior of parameters transfers from time $$t$$ t to $$t+\Delta t$$ t + Δ t in QCME is consistent with the behavior of parameter transfer in LSTM. Based on the above two reasons, the LSTM is used to simulate QCME. In the numerical experiment, an effective method is proposed to truncate QCME, and then the fluctuation noise spectrum data from a two-level quantum transport system is used to train the LSTM network and calculate the transition probability of electron with the parameters of LSTM.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-78609-0_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The latter remains essential in this type of technology; however, it presents a number of risk factors such as distraction or errors of inattention, which constitutes a major risk. Therefore, the need for intelligent transportation systems is convenient. This paper presents an automatic color-based segmentation for object detection in X-ray baggage images at airports. It is based on the use of machine learning to perform the color-based segmentation of X-ray images of scanned baggage. A comparative study between eight different machine learning methods is carried out with the optimization of the hyperparameters for a better design of the different models. The results obtained over our private database (High Tech Detection Systems HDTS) composed by dual-energy X-ray luggage scan images showed a perfect object detection without practically any false detection.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-53440-0_11,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The population is a major reason which adds up to the increasing decibels levels in the city. Although research in this field is still in early stages, but with the newly generated Urban Dataset, things have accelerated. We can now classify sounds into a variety of classes. A combination of audio informatics, feature extraction and deep learning techniques are used to process a stream of audio and then label it into one of the ten classes defined. The process of classification is done by changing the sound wave into digital format. It uses bit depth, frequency and amplitude to convert the stream into an array of numbers depicting the sound. This can be done using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), chromagram, spectral contrast and tonal centroid features. This feature set is used in various models like CNN, RNN, DNN, random forest and SVM.

There is proposed a two-phase method of anomaly detection. Firstly, all the outliers are detected and eliminated from the examined network traffic parameters with the use of the Cook’s distance. Data prepared this way is used in step number two to create models based on multi-layer perceptron neural network and autoregressive neural network which describe variability of the examined street lighting network parameters. In the following stage, resemblance between the expected network traffic and its real variability are analysed in order to identify abnormal behaviour which could demonstrate an attempt of an anomaly or attack. Additionally, we propose a recurrent learning procedure for the exploited neural networks in case there occur significant fluctuations in the real Power Line Communication traffic.

Despite, the benefits accrued by the introduction of traffic management solutions (e.g. improved travel times, maximisation of throughput, etc.), these solutions usually fall short on ensuring the environmental sustainability around the implementation areas. This is because the environmental dimension (e.g. vehicle emissions) is usually absent from the optimisation methodologies adopted for traffic management strategies. Nonetheless, since environmental performance corresponds as a primary goal of contemporary mobility planning, solutions that can guarantee air quality are significant. This study presents an advanced Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) signal control framework, able to incorporate environmental considerations into the core of signal optimisation processes. More specifically, a highly flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm has been developed in order to identify efficient but -more importantly- environmentally friendly signal control strategies. The methodology is deployed on a large-scale micro-simulation environment able to realistically represent urban traffic conditions. Alternative signal control strategies are designed, applied, and evaluated against their achieved traffic efficiency and environmental footprint. Based on the results obtained from the application of the methodology on a core part of the road urban network of Nicosia, Cyprus the best strategy achieved a 4.8% increase of the network throughput, 17.7% decrease of the average queue length and a remarkable 34.2% decrease of delay while considerably reduced the CO emissions by 8.1%.

Transport stakeholders can benefit from computer science advances, such as Artificial Intelligence (ΑΙ) or Data Mining (DM) techniques, which can contribute to the utilization of existing data and maximize their productive efficiency. Reduced operating costs, decreased travel times, as well as faster freight delivery times are among several gains that can be achieved through the adoption of such techniques.

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_24,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This chapter argues for the translation of these dimensions into practical steps as part of a framework of integrated policies at the local level.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-0983-1_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, in a severe pandemic situation like COVID-19, human movements among different regions are taken as the most important point for understanding and forecasting the epidemic spread in a country. Thus, in this study, we collect big human GPS trajectory data covering the total 47 prefectures of Japan and model the daily human movements between each pair of prefectures with time-series Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. Then, given the historical observations from past days, we predict the countrywide OD matrices for the future one or more weeks by proposing a novel deep learning model called Origin-Destination Convolutional Recurrent Network (ODCRN). It integrates the recurrent and 2-dimensional graph convolutional components to deal with the highly complex spatiotemporal dependencies in sequential OD matrices. Experiment results over the entire COVID-19 period demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methodology over existing OD prediction models. Last, we apply the predicted countrywide OD matrices to the SEIR model, one of the most classic and widely used epidemic simulation model, to forecast the COVID-19 infection numbers for the entire Japan. The simulation results also demonstrate the high reliability and applicability of our countrywide OD prediction model for a pandemic scenario like COVID-19.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-86514-6_20,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we forecast human mobility using indoor or outdoor environment datasets, respectively, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Wi-Fi and LinkNYC kiosks, collected in New York City to study how comfort and well-being indicators influence people’s movements. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and Deep Learning (DL) methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, DL methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. DL approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error.

Natural data sets have intrinsic patterns, which can be summarized as the manifold distribution principle: a natural class of data can be treated as a probability distribution on a low-dimensional manifold, embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. A deep learning system mainly accomplishes two tasks: manifold learning and probability distribution learning. Given a manifold X , all the probability measures on X form an infinite dimensional manifold, the so-called Wasserstein space. Optimal transport assigns a Riemannian metric on the Wasserstein space, the so-called Wasserstein metric, and defines Otto’s calculus, such that variational optimization can be carried out in the Wasserstein space P ( X ) $$\mathcal {P}(X)$$ . A deep learning system learns the distribution by optimizing some functionals in the Wasserstein space P ( X ) $$\mathcal {P}(X)$$ ; therefore optimal transport lays down the theoretic foundation for deep learning. This work introduces the theory of optimal transport and the profound relation between Brenier’s theorem and Alexandrov’s theorem in differential geometry via Monge-Ampère equation. We give a variational proof for Alexandrov’s theorem and convert the proof to a computational algorithm to solve the optimal transport maps. The algorithm is based on computational geometry and can be generalized to general manifold setting. Optimal transport theory and algorithms have been extensively applied in the models of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In a GAN model, the generator computes the optimal transport map (OT map), while the discriminator computes the Wasserstein distance between the generated data distribution and the real data distribution. The optimal transport theory shows the competition between the generator and the discriminator is completely unnecessary and should be replaced by collaboration. Furthermore, the regularity theory of optimal transport map explains the intrinsic reason for mode collapsing. A novel generative model is introduced, which uses an autoencoder (AE) for manifold learning and OT map for probability distribution transformation. This AE-OT model improves the theoretical rigor and transparency, as well as the computational stability and efficiency; in particular, it eliminates the mode collapsing.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03009-4_105-1,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since classical statistical learning theory struggles to explain this behaviour, much effort has recently been focused on uncovering the mechanisms behind it, in the hope of developing a more adequate theoretical framework and having a better control over the trained models. In this work, we adopt an alternative perspective, viewing the neural network as a dynamical system displacing input particles over time. We conduct a series of experiments and, by analyzing the network’s behaviour through its displacements, we show the presence of a low kinetic energy bias in the transport map of the network, and link this bias with generalization performance. From this observation, we reformulate the learning problem as follows: find neural networks that solve the task while transporting the data as efficiently as possible. This offers a novel formulation of the learning problem which allows us to provide regularity results for the solution network, based on Optimal Transport theory. From a practical viewpoint, this allows us to propose a new learning algorithm, which automatically adapts to the complexity of the task, and leads to networks with a high generalization ability even in low data regimes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-67661-2_7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we explore the implicit biases present in current approaches and demonstrate where and why they fail.

Using the dynamical formulation of Optimal Transport, this allows us to improve the CycleGAN model into a simple and practical formulation which comes with theoretical guarantees and added robustness.

This makes the “intelligence” part questionable since we expect real artificial intelligence to not only complete a given task but also perform in a way that is understandable. One way to approach this is to build a connection between artificial intelligence and human intelligence. Here, we use grammar transfer to demonstrate a paradigm that connects these two types of intelligence. Specifically, we define the action of transferring the knowledge learned by a recurrent neural network from one regular grammar to another grammar as grammar transfer. We are motivated by the theory that there is a natural correspondence between second-order recurrent neural networks and deterministic finite automata, which are uniquely associated with regular grammars. To study the process of grammar transfer, we propose a category based framework we denote as grammar transfer learning. Under this framework, we introduce three isomorphic categories and define ideal transfers by using transportation theory in operations research. By regarding the optimal transfer plan as a sensible operation from a human perspective, we then use it as a reference for examining whether a learning model behaves intelligently when performing the transfer task. Experiments under our framework demonstrate that this learning model can learn a grammar intelligently in general, but fails to follow the optimal way of learning.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-67661-2_36,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Furthermore, the conventional transportation system also emits other particulate matter into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and associated health issues. Thus, the aforementioned negative consequences of fossil-based transport system make it central to the energy and climate challenge. Therefore, the most practical and sustainable solution for effective mitigation of climate change and energy security concerns is the electrification of the transportation sector – a paradigm shift in the conventional mobility sector. As the electric power system is already in transition and experiencing its own paradigm shift – Smart(er) Grid – “Transportation Electrification” is thus the timely development for introducing a paradigm shift in the mobility sector. The vision of electrified mobility is to lower the environmental footprint of the transportation sector, which further demands the utilization of more renewable energy resource-based generation mix in the electricity grid – “Greener Grid.” Thus, in this chapter, we explain the potential of transportation electrification for reducing the harmful climatic emissions and the nexus of energy and economy with electric mobility.

However, the dense deployment of UAV base station and ground base station brings great challenges in the configuration of neighbor cell list (NCL) during handover process. This paper presents a Cascading Bandits based Mobility Management (CBMM) algorithm for NCL configuration in the low altitude heterogeneous networks, where online learning is used to exploiting the historical handover information. In addition to the received signal strength, the cell load of each base station is also considered in the handover procedure. We aim at optimizing the configuration of NCL, so as to improve handover performance by increasing the probability of selecting the best target base station while at the same time reducing the selection delay. It is proved that the signaling overhead can be effectively reduced, since the proposed CBMM algorithm can significantly cut down the number of candidate base stations in NCL. Moreover, by ranking the candidate base stations according to their historical performance, the number of measured base stations in handover preparation phase can be effectively reduced to avoid extra delay. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm and other two existing solutions are presented to illustrate that the CBMM algorithm can achieve efficient handover management.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-1967-0_9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, there is little study to consider a reasonable method of generating a mobility model based on reinforcement learning. In this paper, we proposed a method for generating a mobility model using reinforcement learning to earn rewards most efficiently. A dataset containing mobility traces of taxi cabs in San Francisco was used to propose the method where each taxi agent learns its actions selected by giving rewards, such as passenger fare, gasoline cost, and the distribution of the positions of past passengers. The $$\epsilon $$ -greedy method was used to consider the method to perform reinforcement learning. The degree of learning was compared by changing the exploration parameter $$\epsilon $$ . As a result, it was found that the cumulative reward was the highest when $$\epsilon =0$$ , which is different from usual results in $$\epsilon $$ -greedy method.

Handoff is initiated when the signal strength of a current user deteriorates below a certain threshold. In cognitive radio network, the perception of handoff is different due to the presence of two categories of users: certified/primary user and uncertified/secondary user. The reason for the spectrum handoff arises when the primary user (PU) returns to one of its band used by the secondary user. The spectrum handoff is of two types: reactive handoff and proactive handoff. There are certain limitations in reactive handoff, such as it suffers from prolonged handoff latency and interference. In the proactive handoff, the operation of handoff is planned and implemented by predicting the emergence of primary user based on the historical data usage.

Smart grid, the new-generation power grid, focuses on duplex communication between suppliers and consumers. The heterogeneous nature of smart grid possesses different security threats, and integrating these components in the grid increases the possibility of vulnerabilities. The major challenge is to make sure that power availability is not affected when implementing security in the grid and hence a cyber-resilient smart grid is the need of the hour. Secure smart grid last-mile communication includes secure smart meters, smart homes and home area network. Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart homes are distributed throughout the smart grid home area network to facilitate the dynamic nature of grid. Smart meters communicate with all the entities involved in last-mile communication of the smart grid. A social Internet of Things based on trust model should be implemented for cyber resilience in smart homes for secure data transmission. The trust-based social IoT smart home architecture consists of machine learning-based predictive system for detection of cyber-attacks in smart homes. Machine learning approaches will be able to consider the computing capabilities of devices involved in smart homes and analyse the possible patterns of cyber-attack in the grid.

Depending on weather conditions trips may be delayed, demand may be changed as well as the modal shift. These variations have a major impact on the use and operation of public transport, particularly in transport systems that operate close to capacity. However, the influence of weather conditions on transport demand is difficult to predict and quantify. For this purpose, an artificial neural network model – the Multilayer Perceptron – is used as a regression model to estimate the demand of urban public transport buses based on weather conditions. Transit bus ridership and weather conditions were collected along a year from a medium-size European metropolitan area (Oporto, Portugal) and linked under the assumption that individuals choose the travel mode based on the weather conditions that are observed during the departure hour, the hour before and two hours before. The transit ridership data were also labelled according to the hour, day of the week, month, and whether there was a strike and/or holiday or not. The results demonstrate that it is possible to predict the demand of public transport buses using the weather conditions observed two hours before with low error for the entire network (MAE = 143 and RMSE = 322). The use of weather conditions allow to decreases the error of the prediction by ~8% for the entire network.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-61075-3_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The cornea is avascular, meeting its oxygen requirements largely from the atmosphere by diffusion across the tear film and epithelium; conversely, it derives most of its additional nutritional requirements from the aqueous humor arising from across the corneal endothelium. The epithelium of the cornea provides the major barrier to tear-borne pathogens, while the corneal endothelium is principally responsible for maintaining the hydration and clarity of the corneal stroma. As the highest refractive power in the optics of the eye, subtle variations in corneal curvature lead to higher order aberrations that can be assessed with corneal topography. Measured with instruments that analyze reflected patterns from the tear film, variations of the Placido disk permit the most sensitive assessments of corneal optical properties. These data form the basis for the color-coded contour map display of corneal curvature, permitting clinical diagnosis of a wide variety of corneal pathologies as well as evaluation and development of refractive surgical procedures.

Recent works mainly focus on demand prediction in settled stations, which ignore the realistic scenarios that bike stations may be deployed or removed. To predict station-level demands with evolving new stations, we face two main challenges: (1) How to effectively capture new interactions in time-evolving station networks; (2) How to learn spatial patterns for new stations due to the limited historical data.

The results present a forecast of urban growth for the years 2025 and 2050. While running these processes, percent correct metric (PCM) and kappa statistics are being generated and a collective map of urban growth probability is obtained.

Application of such an approach in the urbanized terrain requires the use of the complicated and computationally expensive dispersion models taking into account the complicated wind field. As a result, the localization systems require to much time to be applied in the real toxin threat situation, when the reaction time is the most crucial.

In this context, the precise estimation of the renewable potential of given areas is valuable to decision-makers. This is particularly difficult for the urban case. In Chile, valuable data for solving this problem is available, however, standard machine learning algorithms struggle with their variable-length input. We take advantage of the ability of 1-D Convolutional Neural Network to fuse feature extraction and learning over a heterogeneous representation of the data. In the present manuscript, we propose an architecture to estimate the PV potential of Chilean cities and extract the relevant features over heterogeneous representations of available data. To this end, we describe and examine the performance of said architecture over the available data. We also extract its intermediate convolutional features and use them as inputs of other machine learning algorithms to compare performances.

Problems like traffic congestion have led to a significant time burden around the world, and one significant solution to these problems can be the proper implementation of the intelligent transport system (ITS). It involves the integration of various tools like smart sensors, artificial intelligence, position technologies and mobile data services to manage traffic flow, reduce congestion and enhance driver's ability to avoid accidents and reduce incidents or adverse weather. Road and traffic sign recognition is an emerging field of research in ITS. Classification problem of traffic signs needs to be solved as it is a major step in our journey toward building semiautonomous/autonomous driving systems. Traditionally, Mobileye had developed its first commercially deployed traffic sign recognition system with Continental AG for the BMW-7 series vehicles, but this technology has not been used much. The purpose of this work focusses on implementing an approach to solve the problem of traffic sign classification by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier using the GTSRB — German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

Optimal placement of these controllers is very important for efficient management and control. Traditional SDN controller placement methods focus mostly on controller placement in datacenter networks. But the problem of virtualized controller placement for multi-domain transport networks needs to be solved in the context of geographically distributed heterogeneous multi-domain networks. In this context, edge datacenters have enabled network operators to place virtualized controller instances closer to users, besides providing more candidate locations for controller placement. In this study, we propose a dynamic controller placement method for optical transport networks that considers the heterogeneity of optical controllers, resource limitations at edge hosting locations, and latency requirements.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology of two-wheeled vehicle detection using two categories of deep learning-based object detection models including two-step and single-step techniques. In two-step object detection techniques, experiments are carried out with object detection models such as a region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, and region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN), while in single-step object detection techniques, detection is performed using the single-shot multibox detector (SSD), SDDLite, and you only look once (YOLOv3) detection models. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MB7500 and Tsinghua-Daimler Cyclist data. The experimentation results demonstrate that Faster-RCNN with the Inception-Resnetv2 backbone model impressively outperforms two-step object detection techniques, while in single-step object detection techniques, SSD with the Inceptionv2 model shows superior performance.

Moreover, the accuracy level also depends on other factors such as the type of data, sample size, region of data collection, and time of prediction. To efficiently facilitate such a model tuning process, this study attempts to summarize the relationship between the prediction accuracy of deep learning models and the factors which influence it. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature by adopting a detailed search strategy, followed by a meta-analysis on prediction accuracy. Four separate linear mixed effects models, taking into account unobserved heterogeneities in prediction accuracy across studies, were developed to statistically test the impacts of influential factors on prediction accuracy for (a) all observations (136 studies; 2314 cases), (b) studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (86 studies; 1,878 cases), (c) classification-based studies with accuracy indicator (29 studies; 220 cases), and (d) traffic forecasting studies with MAPE, MRE, and average accuracy indicators (36 studies, 991 cases). The final model includes additional factors to test the influence of sample size and time horizon of prediction variables. The findings showed that, as expected, deep learning models, particularly ones that consider spatiotemporal dependencies of transport phenomena, show better prediction accuracies compared to conventional machine learning models. We also found that, on average, the prediction accuracy is improved by 5.90% with 100 million additional data, while the accuracy is reduced by 5.28% with 100 min increase in time horizon of prediction in traffic forecasting studies.

In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps.

There is paucity of studies that uses modern soft computing techniques to understand the factors driving the use of FOBs. The aim of the work presented here was to identify the important predictors that determine usability of FOBs. The study utilized both questionnaire survey (perception in terms of satisfaction/dissatisfaction) and field data collected across fourteen locations in six different Indian cities. The goal was to identify the essential features that drive the usability of FOBs under four different contexts, i.e., mobility friction, safety and security, and vertical connectivity and horizontal connectivity. Three soft computing algorithms such as generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) were trained to predict the future usability of pedestrians. The modelling approach involved data collection from 14 FOB locations, preprocessing involving data input in spreadsheets, removing missing values and normalization for model training. The next stage involved splitting the data into training and testing set, followed by model training and hyper-parameter optimization using tenfold cross-validation. Finally, the developed models were evaluated for test dataset for generalization. The study results revealed that GBM algorithm showed highest classification accuracy on test dataset over the other two techniques at various scenarios. GBM helped in identifying the essential parameters that drive the usability of FOBs under the four different contexts. Sensitivity analysis supported the fact that gender and age had significant impact on the choice of pedestrians under different contexts. Further, the respondents’ feedbacks regarding existing problems were used to validate the findings. The safety and security, walk environment, frequency of daily use, comfort, location type, length of travel, stairway dimensions and reduced walkable width affected the choice of using the FOBs. Therefore, provision of CCTV cameras and security personnel, removal of obstruction, provision of proper lighting and all-weather shade, and regular maintenance of the facilities will significantly improve the pedestrians’ choice to use the FOBs.

One important element to increase transparency is reliable, up-to-date and accurate arrival time prediction, commonly referred to as estimated time of arrival (ETA). ETAs are not easy to determine, especially for intermodal freight transports, in which freight is transported in an intermodal container, using multiple modes of transportation. This computational study describes the structure of an ETA prediction model for intermodal freight transport networks (IFTN), in which schedule-based and non-schedule-based transports are combined, based on machine learning (ML). For each leg of the intermodal freight transport, an individual ML prediction model is developed and trained using the corresponding historical transport data and external data. The research presented in this study shows that the ML approach produces reliable ETA predictions for intermodal freight transport. These predictions comprise processing times at logistics nodes such as inland terminals and transport times on road and rail. Consequently, the outcome of this research allows decision makers to proactively communicate disruption effects to actors along the intermodal transportation chain. These actors can then initiate measures to counteract potential critical delays at subsequent stages of transport. This approach leads to increased process efficiency for all actors in the realization of complex transport operations and thus has a positive effect on the resilience and profitability of IFTNs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-020-00653-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A Smart City requires computational platforms, which allow the interconnection of multiple and embedded systems, such that the technology is integrated with people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. The integration of information and communications technology in these spaces, allows exploiting the wealth of information and knowledge generated in a Smart City, and improving its planning and services offered to its citizens. In this way, the people are immersed in these spaces, which are aware of their presence (context-sensitive) and adapt to their needs. The context analysis in a smart city allows making available services and information, to support ubiquitously the activities of the individuals. This study aims to analyze the emerging and ubiquitous capabilities of an Autonomic Reflective Middleware. The Middleware is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, responding to the requirements of citizens.

Due to various uncertain factors in the real-world scenarios, (e.g., resolution variation, viewpoint variation, illumination changes, occlusion, etc., vehicle Re-ID is a very challenging task. To resist the adverse effect of resolution variation, a joint pyramid feature representation network (JPFRN) for vehicle Re-ID is proposed in this paper. Based on the consideration that various convolution blocks with different depths hold different resolutions and semantic information of the vehicle image, the proposed JPFRN method employs a base network to obtain multi-resolution vehicle features in the first stage. Then, a pyramid feature representation scheme is developed to reconstruct and integrate the obtained multi-resolution vehicle features together. Finally, these pyramid features are jointly represented for learning a more discriminative feature under the supervision of joint Triplet loss and softmax loss. Extensive experimental results on two commonly-used vehicle databases (i.e., VehicleID and VeRi) show that the proposed JPFRN is superior to multiple recently-developed vehicle Re-ID methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11036-020-01561-z,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This research aimed to compare the accuracy of some individual models including boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), functional discriminant analysis (FDA), generalized linear model (GLM), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), random forest (RF) and two new hybrid models including FDA-GLM-MDA and RF-CART-BRT for predicting the fire hazard in a fire-prone area in the northeast Iran, Golestan Province. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset from ten effective parameters including digital elevation model (DEM), slope angle (SA), plan curvature (PC), topographic wetness index (TWI), annual rainfall mean (ARM), annual temperature mean (ATM), wind effect (WE), distance to urban areas (DTU), distance to streams (DTS) and distance to roads (DTR) was created in GIS. Furthermore, 3705 historical fire locations in the Golestan Province from 2002 to 2017 were obtained from MODIS fire product dataset. Then, the variable importance was assessed using the XGBoost machine learning (ML) technique. Finally, the individual and hybrid models were evaluated using the ROC-AUC method. The results showed that the DTU was the most important factor in modeling and mapping the fire hazard in the Golestan Province. Also, the results demonstrated that the individual random forest (RF) (AUC = 0.855) and hybrid RF-CART-BRT algorithms (AUC = 0.854) were the most accurate predictive models for mapping the fire hazard in the Golestan Province, respectively. Considering the high significance of DTU in fire occurrence in this study, the area of fire hazard classes in fourteen different counties of the Golestan Province was calculated using the most accurate model (RF model). The final results indicated that Minudasht County had the most area (35.55%) of fire hazard in the very high fire hazard class. The results of this study are very useful for local forest managers to control the future fires using the best model in the natural areas of the Golestan Province, especially in Minudasht County. The protective management of the natural areas of the Golestan Province would be performed based on the fire hazard maps produced by RF and RF-CART-BRT algorithms. We recommend applying these models for fire danger mapping in fire-prone areas around the world which have semi-arid conditions. More comparative assessment of individual and ensemble models for fire danger mapping in semi-arid areas around the world could provide a baseline for monitoring fire danger in similar conditions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-020-04169-4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It uses various types of sensors deployed in different geospatial locations to continuously and cooperatively monitor the natural and cultural environment in urban areas. Nevertheless, issues such as uneven distribution, low sampling rate and high failure ratio of sensors often make their readings less reliable. This paper provides an innovative framework to detect the noise data as well as to repair them from a spatial-temporal causality perspective rather than to deal with them individually. This can be achieved by connecting data through monitored objects, using the Skip-gram model to estimate spatial correlation and long short-term memory to estimate temporal correlation. The framework consists of three major modules: 1) a space embedded Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based sequence labeling module to detect the noise data and the latent missing data; 2) a space embedded BiLSTM-based sequence predicting module calculating the value of the missing data; 3) an object characteristics fusion repairing module to correct the spatial and temporal dislocation sensory data. The approach is evaluated with real-world data collected by over 3 000 electronic traffic bayonet devices in a citywide scale of a medium-sized city in China, and the result is superior to those of several referenced approaches. With a 12.9% improvement in data accuracy over the raw data, the proposed framework plays a significant role in various real-world use cases in urban governance, such as criminal investigation, traffic violation monitoring, and equipment maintenance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11390-020-9724-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, few studies considered urban form and meteorological factors integratively and analyzed their synthetic effects on air pollution. Objectives We investigate how to model the integrated effects on the spatiotemporal distribution of PM_2.5 in the Atlanta metropolitan area to improve the understanding of the urban form-air quality relationship. Methods Two groups of models are developed: one uses urban form only and the other uses wind-direct urban form. Relative humidity, wind speed, and temperature are included as control variables. Both linear (Multiple Linear Regression) and nonlinear models (Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network) are constructed and tested with both tenfold cross-validation and field PM_2.5 data obtained from a portable device, AirBeam2. Results Random Forest overall outperforms other models suggesting that the urban form-air quality relationship is most likely to be nonlinear. Additionally, the group using wind-direct urban form outperforms the other group and the contribution of the same urban form metrics differs in different wind sections proving that meteorological factors and urban form have synthetic effects on PM_2.5. Finally, the patch density, dominance, and aggregation of roads and vegetation, demonstrate higher attribute significance than other urban form metrics.

Then different features are extracted and Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion based features are selected. Further patient's health condition is analyzed and classified into a normal and abnormal person. The classification process is done by applying the harmony optimized modular neural network.

Various analytical and numerical models are generally utilized for such characterization. Analytical models are used for solving simple and idealized pollution transport problems, while numerical models deal with real-world pollution transport simulations. However, in situations where any of the aquifer parameters (such as geological properties, boundary conditions, initial conditions, etc.) are not explicitly defined, use of these models becomes redundant. Simulation of pollution transport under such scenarios becomes challenging. To tackle such problems, researchers generally make use of artificial neural network (ANN) models. Existing literature review reveals that feed-forward backpropagation (FFBNN) models are the most commonly used training method while the applicability of other ANN models has not been appropriately explored. In this study, various ANN models, encompassing supervised and unsupervised neural networks, like, cascade-forward backpropagation (CFBNN), FFBNN, radial basis function (RBFNN), exact radial basis function (ERBFNN) and generalized regression (GRNN), have been developed, and their performances are compared for transport simulation of a conservative pollutant in a two-dimensional hypothetical aquifer. The models reported have pollution injection rates and locations of the sources as input data and the pollution concentrations measured in some water supply wells (or monitoring wells) are considered as target data. Stability of the developed models has been validated by sensitivity analyses. This study reveals that alternative ANN models (other than the ones already reported in literature) can be reliable for simulation of pollutant transport in groundwater systems. A caracterização do transporte de contaminante em ambientes subterrâneos é um pré requisito para o uso e gerenciamento sustentáveis das águas subterrâneas, e vários modelo analíticos e numéricos são prescritos para este fim. Modelos analíticos são usados para resolver problemas simples e idealizados de transporte de poluição, enquanto modelos numéricos lidam com simulações de transporte de poluição no mundo real. No entanto, situações em que alguns dos parâmetros do aquífero (como propriedades geológicas, condições de contorno, e condições iniciais, etc.) não são definidos explicitamente, o uso desses modelos se torna redundante. A simulação do transporte de poluição em tais cenários se torna desafiadora. Para resolver esses problemas, pesquisadores geralmente fazem uso de modelos de rede neural artificial (RNA). A revisão da literatura existente revela que os modelos de retropropagação de alimentação para frente (RNRAF) são o método de treinamento mais comumente usados, e a aplicabilidade de outros modelos RNA não foi explorada adequadamente. Neste estudo, vários modelos RNA, abrangendo redes neurais supervisionadas e não supervisionadas, como retropropagação em cascata para frente (RNRCF), RNRAF, função de base radial (RNFBR), função de base radial exata (RNFBRE) e regressão generalizada (RNRG), foram desenvolvidos e seus desempenhos são comparados para simulação de transporte de um poluente conservativo em um aquífero bidimensional hipotético. Os modelos relatados têm taxas de injeção de poluição e localização das fontes como dados de entrada; as concentrações de poluição medidas em alguns poços de abastecimento (ou poços de monitoramento) são considerados como dados alvo. A estabilidade dos modelos desenvolvidos foi validada por análise de sensibilidade. Este estudo constata que modelos alternativos de RNA (além dos frequentemente relatados na literatura) podem ser confiáveis quando desenvolvidos para simular o transporte de poluentes em sistemas de águas subterrâneas. La caracterización del transporte de contaminantes en ambientes subsuperficiales es un requisito previo para el uso y la gestión sostenibles de las aguas subterráneas, y se prescriben diversos modelos analíticos y numéricos para este fin. Los modelos analíticos se utilizan para resolver problemas sencillos e idealizados de transporte de contaminantes, mientras que los modelos numéricos se ocupan de simulaciones de transporte de contaminantes en el plano real. Sin embargo, en las situaciones en que cualquiera de los parámetros del acuífero (como las propiedades geológicas, las condiciones límite, las condiciones iniciales, etc.) no están definidos explícitamente, el uso de estos modelos se hace redundante. La simulación del transporte de la contaminación en tales escenarios se convierte en un desafío. Para hacer frente a esos problemas, los investigadores suelen utilizar modelos de redes neuronales artificiales ( ANN ). El examen de la literatura existente revela que los modelos de retropropagación de retroalimentación (FFBNN) son el método de capacitación más utilizado, y no se ha explorado adecuadamente la aplicabilidad de otros modelos de ANN. En el presente estudio se han desarrollado varios modelos de redes neuronales supervisadas y no supervisadas, como la retropropagación en cascada (CFBNN), la FFBNN, la función de base radial (RBFNN), la función de base radial exacta (ERBFNN) y la regresión generalizada (GRNN), y se comparan sus resultados para la simulación del transporte de un contaminante conservador en un acuífero hipotético bidimensional. Los modelos presentados tienen como datos de entrada las tasas de inyección de contaminación y la ubicación de las fuentes; las concentraciones de contaminación medidas en algunos pozos de abastecimiento de agua (o pozos de monitoreo) se consideran datos objetivo. La estabilidad de los modelos elaborados se ha validado mediante análisis de sensibilidad. En este estudio se ha comprobado que los modelos alternativos de ANN (distintos de los que suelen figurar en la bibliografía) pueden ser fiables cuando se elaboran, para simular el transporte de contaminantes en los sistemas de aguas subterráneas. La caractérisation du transport des contaminants dans les environnements souterrains est une condition préalable à l'utilisation et à la gestion durables des eaux souterraines, et divers modèles analytiques et numériques sont prescrits à cette fin.

Cependant, dans les situations où aucun des paramètres de l'aquifère (tels que les propriétés géologiques, les conditions aux limites, les conditions initiales, etc.) n'est explicitement défini, l'utilisation de ces modèles devient redondante. La simulation du transport de la pollution dans de tels scénarios constitue un défi.Pour résoudre ces problèmes, les chercheurs utilisent généralement des modèles de réseaux de neurones artificiels (RNA).La revue de la littérature existante révèle que les modèles de propagation avant et rétropropagation (feed-forward backpropagation neural network - FFBNN) sont la méthode de formation la plus couramment utilisée, et l'applicabilité d'autres modèles RNA n'a pas été explorée de manière appropriée. Dans cette étude, divers modèles RNA, englobant des réseaux de neurones supervisés et non supervisés, comme la rétropropagation en cascade (CFBNN), la FFBNN, la fonction de base radiale (RBFNN), la fonction de base radiale exacte (ERBFNN) et la régression généralisée (GRNN) ont été développés, et leurs performances sont comparées pour la simulation du transport d'un polluant conservateur dans un aquifère hypothétique bidimensionnel. Les modèles rapportés ont des taux d'injection de pollution et des emplacements des sources comme données d'entrée; les concentrations de pollution mesurées dans certains puits d'alimentation en eau (ou puits de surveillance) sont considérées comme des données cibles.La stabilité des modèles développés a été validée par des analyses de sensibilité.

Furthermore, they are extremely nonlinear phenomena that are complex to analyze. Therefore, a classification-based real-time flood prediction model for urban areas is constructed in this study, by combining a numerical analysis model based on hydraulic theory with a machine learning model. Flood databases are constructed in advance for different rainfall scenarios using the Environmental Protection Agency-Storm Water Management Model (EPA-SWMM) and a two-dimensional inundation model. The flood depth data for each map grid are divided into five categories based on the average flood depth using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classification techniques for higher-precision flood range prediction. A model is constructed to predict the representative cumulative volume if the observed rainfall is entered. For spatial expansion of the flood depth with the predicted representative cumulative volume, a system capable of generating a real-time flood map is constructed by linking the cumulative volume of each grid with the representative cumulative volume using linear and nonlinear regression. When compared with the results of a verified two-dimensional (2D) flood model, the developed-model goodness-of-fit is 85%, with a required run time of 1 min 12 s.

Instead of using the max pooling layer, the proposed multi-target corner pooling (MTCP) layer is used to generate the vehicles’ corners. And in order to complete the blocked corners that cannot be generated by MTCP, a novel matching corners method is adopted in the network. Therefore, the proposed network can detect blocked vehicles accurately.

In addition, improved controlling of associative recall of information from the memory of recurrent neural networks is provided to improve the accuracy of forecasting. The results of traffic flow forecasting are presented. The results are compared with estimates obtained using other methods.

As the world is increasingly populated by IoT devices and sensors that can sense their surroundings and communicate with each other, a digital environment has been created with vast volumes of volatile and diverse data. Traditional AI and machine learning techniques designed for deterministic situations are not suitable for such environments. With a large number of parameters required by each device in this digital environment, it is desirable that the AI is able to be adaptive and self-build (i.e. self-structure, self-configure, self-learn), rather than be structurally and parameter-wise pre-defined. This study explores the benefits of self-building AI and machine learning with unsupervised learning for empowering big data analytics for smart city environments. By using the growing self-organizing map, a new suite of self-building AI is proposed. The self-building AI overcomes the limitations of traditional AI and enables data processing in dynamic smart city environments. With cloud computing platforms, the self-building AI can integrate the data analytics applications that currently work in silos. The new paradigm of the self-building AI and its value are demonstrated using the IoT, video surveillance, and action recognition applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10796-020-10056-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The responses, defined by a set of individual attributes, corresponding to the MTD, are computed from seismic volume and amalgamated them into a hybrid attribute. This generated new attribute, called as MTD Cube meta-attribute, does not only define the subsurface architecture of MTD distinctly but also reduces the human involvement thereby accelerating the process of interpretation.

In this paper, we focus on two major aspects of the Twitter social network associated with altmetrics: (a) to analyze the properties of bots on Twitter networks and (b) to distinguish between bots and human accounts. Firstly, we employed state-of-the-art social network analysis techniques that exploit Twitter’s social network properties in novel altmetrics data. We found that 87% of tweets are affected by bots that are involved in the network’s dominant communities. We also found that, to some extent, community size and the degree of distribution in Twitter’s altmetrics network follow a power-law distribution. Furthermore, we applied a deep learning model, graph convolutional networks, to distinguish between organic (human) and bot Twitter accounts. The deployed model achieved the promising results, providing up to 71% classification accuracy over 200 epochs. Overall, the study concludes that bot presence in altmetrics-associated social media platforms can artificially inflate the number of social usage counts. As a result, special attention is required to eliminate such discrepancies when using altmetrics data for smart decision-making, such as research assessment either independently or complementary along with traditional bibliometric indices.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-020-04689-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this field, the Web offers many opportunities, such as the e-learning platforms where students can learn, according to their own needs and pace. The massive open online courses (MOOCs) are particular distance learning platforms, generally offering, so far, free courses on a huge amount of topics, and characterized by a (potentially) very high number of enrollments. In a MOOC, a teacher, or tutor, has a hard life when trying to follow and manage with the learning processes of thousands of students. In particular, assessment can be managed almost exclusively by letting the student answer questions in closed answers tests. This strategy has some didactic limits, while a valid alternative is to use peer assessment (PA) over more articulated assessment activities (e.g., open-ended questions). PA makes students grade their peers’ answers, and provides learners with significant advantages, such as refining their knowledge of the subject matter, and developing their meta-cognitive skills. In this work, we present a software platform called K-OpenAnswer, which helps teachers to simulate the dynamic of a MOOC where PA is used. The system uses a machine learning technique, based on a modified version of the K-NN algorithm, and provides teachers with a statistical environment by which they can monitor the evolving dynamic of a simulated MOOC, according to the techniques we use to implement PA.

Many prediction models achieve fine results. However, most ignore the intrinsic characteristics of traffic parameter data and do not consider the spatiotemporal effects of road sections, which can reflect the situation of all road traffic. Therefore, multi-section traffic prediction is still an open problem. In this paper, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the information of traffic parameters into many intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, which represent the original road traffic information in periodic and random sequences. Then, by considering the superiority of deep learning in multi-dimensional data processing, which can handle the spatiotemporal effects, a prediction model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to achieve the prediction of periodic and random sequences, whose results are combined to obtain the final prediction. The dataset from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System is used to validate the model.

This demands the development of advanced predictive vision systems which exploits stream mining concepts for intelligent processing of visual data streams. Among other challenges faced by visual data streams, a major challenge is concept drift, which is caused by overtime change in data distribution. In the presence of skewed data, the detection of concept drift becomes more challenging. When analyzing the data generated from smart devices and other performance critical wireless sensors, concept drift affects data integrity and accuracy of prediction results. EWMA for Concept Drift Detection (ECDD) has been proposed in the literature for detecting data streams. However, ECDD has a high prediction error rate which makes it less useful for performance critical data streams generated by imaging and video data streams. In this paper, Vision based Drift Detection Method (VisDDM) is proposed, which systematically handles abrupt and gradual concept drift in data streams. Experiments have been performed using synthetic and real world datasets from different application domains.

Sustainable urban development requires a better understanding of the impacts of urban growth on ecosystems. We selected Guangzhou City to analyze the impacts of urban development processes and urban geographic changes on NPP, as well as the correlation between urbanization intensity and NPP, using a deep-learning urbanization characteristic index (UCI). The results showed that the NPP in the study area had clear spatial heterogeneity and declined overall from 2001 to 2013. Guangzhou’s urbanization became more and more intense, the mean UCI increased significantly from 0.1293 in 2001 to 0.2879 in 2013, and urban geographic type was dominated by urban exurbs in 2001 and 2013 while urban fringe areas increased most significantly and about 2,320.24 km^2 of urban exurbs were converted to urban fringes. There was a significant negative correlation between UCI and NPP in 2001 and 2013, implying that NPP had been negatively influenced by the increasing urban development intensity.

To achieve low noise, they require many samples per pixel, resulting in long rendering time. To reduce the cost, one solution is Monte Carlo denoising, which renders the image with fewer samples per pixel (as little as 128) and then denoises the resulting image. Many Monte Carlo denoising methods rely on deep learning: they use convolutional neural networks to learn the relationship between noisy images and reference images, using auxiliary features such as position and normal together with image color as inputs. The network predicts kernels which are then applied to the noisy input. These methods show powerful denoising ability, but tend to lose geometric or lighting details and to blur sharp features during denoising. In this paper, we solve this issue by proposing a novel network structure, a new input feature—light transport covariance from path space—and an improved loss function. Our network separates feature buffers from the color buffer to enhance detail effects. The features are extracted separately and then integrated into a shallow kernel predictor. Our loss function considers perceptual loss, which also improves detail preservation. In addition, we use a light transport covariance feature in path space as one of the features, which helps to preserve illumination details. Our method denoises Monte Carlo path traced images while preserving details much better than previous methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s41095-020-0167-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the output of these types of resources can be highly variable and depend on weather fluctuations such as wind speed and cloud cover. Since photovoltaic power generation is highly dependent on weather conditions, photovoltaic power generation operates differently in different regions. In particular, solar irradiance affects photovoltaic power generation. This means that solar power forecasting becomes an important tool for optimal economic management of the electric power network. In this chapter, an artificial intelligence technique is recommended to calculate the number of solar power panels required to satisfy a given estimated daily electricity load for five countries: the Kingdom of Bahrain, Egypt, India, Thailand, and the UK. Such artificial intelligence techniques play an important role in modeling and prediction in renewable energy engineering. The main focus of this chapter is the design of photovoltaic solar power plants, which help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions where they are connected to the national electricity grid in order to feed the grid with the extra electricity they generate. In this case, the power plant becomes more efficient than a combined cycle plant. At the same time, modeling and prediction in renewable energy engineering helps engineers to make predictions regarding future required loads.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-34094-0_12,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nevertheless, traffic sign detection still faces two difficulties due to the characteristics of traffic signs. The first difficulty is the detection of small and blurred traffic signs. The second difficulty is that training samples are sparse and imbalanced. For tackling these two difficulties, Guided Region Enlarging Algorithm (GREA) is proposed in the paper. The GREA consists of two sub-modules, Potential region estimation network (PREN) and NMS-Cropping. The PREN obtains a potential object region of each input image first. Then, the potential object region is enlarged by the NMS-Cropping algorithm for subsequent augmenting training. The GREA makes use of features of a small and blurred traffic sign to enhance the performance of a traffic sign detector. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed approach, two traffic sign datasets include the Swedish traffic sign data set and the Tsinghua-Tencent 100k data set are utilized in the experiment. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed GREA, and our approach is comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-60799-9_32,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The collection of this valuable data opens effective opportunities for routine prediction. With the growing ability of vehicles to collect spatial and temporal information solving the routine prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible.

A vehicle that is capable of predicting the next destination of the driver and when the driver intends to leave to that destination can prepare the journey in advance.

In Nepal, 15% of the naturally occurring bird species are nationally threatened due to human-caused habitat alteration, largely because of urbanization. However, little research and data are available allowing for science-based conservation such as species distribution models and richness/evenness calculations for birds living in urban spaces. In Nepal, the large majority of people follow Hindu or Buddhist traditions, and culturally many people see birds and other animals as spiritually divine and deserving of respect and welcoming. It is therefore common for shop owners to encourage birds to visit shops in the mornings via the spreading of birdseed, and it is customary to leave alone any nests birds have built inside of shops, religious sites, restaurants, homes and the living quarters. With first explorations in 2014 and 2015 we conducted during May and June 2016 and 2017 a rapid assessment street study of avian species roosting and nesting in and around shops and restaurants in urban centers, monasteries and religious sites in Nepal. Georeferenced avian point counts with photos, vegetation/urbanization assessments, and nest detection surveys were conducted within Kathmandu, Pokhara, and smaller mountain villages in Nepal. This was done in order to assess and describe the level of urbanization preferred by different functional groups of birds, and to determine whether birds and nests would be found in a shop and restaurant given the urbanization level of the surroundings and the religious background of the business and property owner. Our Urban ecology study closely focuses on distribution and population numbers of urban-associated species, including swallows, sparrows, pigeons, parrots and kites. We used opportunistic but representative point counts and nest surveys to provide first open access data on the effect of urbanization on generalist bird diversity. The GIS layers are the first of their kind but are globally available for most cities. Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used here to predict and extrapolate the effect of religious affiliation and urban variables on bird nest acceptance, distribution, population spread and nesting habits of avian species. This study creates the first open access and open source geographic information systems (GIS) database of bird species nesting and roosting in urban spaces within Nepal to inform and advise future management and research decisions.

Predicting the crowding level on public transport can indeed be useful for enriching the information available to passengers to enable them to better plan their daily trips. Moreover, operators will increasingly need to assess and predict network passenger load to improve train regulation processes and service quality levels. The main issues to address in this forecasting task are the variability in the train load series induced by the train schedule and the influence of several contextual factors, such as calendar information.

This work proposes a predictive congestion avoidance by re-routing system that uses a mechanism based on Deep Learning that combines real-time and historical data to characterize future traffic conditions. The model uses the information obtained from the previous step to determine the zones with possible congestion and redirects the vehicles that are about to cross them.

Coastal areas are one of the most sensitive and altered ecosystems world-wide, as they are subject to many disasters and risks including high winds resulting in cyclones and underwater earthquakes initiating strong tidal waves or tsunamis. These disasters are responsible for the loss of lives and/or infrastructural damages in coastal areas. To address this entails the designing of early warning systems that disseminate relevant information effectively and efficiently, as alarms or warnings, to communities at risk during or before such disasters so that timely and adequate steps can be taken to minimize the loss and damages associated with such disasters.

In opportunistic networks, mobile nodes are used to establish communication between nodes despite of non-availability of a dedicated route between them. Furthermore, nodes don’t acquire any knowledge in advance about the characteristics of the network such as the network topology and the location of the other nodes. Hence, designing a routing algorithm becomes a challenging task since traditional routing protocols used in the Internet are not feasible for the characteristics inherent type of network. The proposed work propounds a multi-copy routing algorithm based on machine learning named iProphet or improved Prophet (Probability routing protocol using history of encounters and transitivity). iProphet, uses dynamically changing contextual information of nodes and the delivery probability of Prophet to carry out message transfer. The iProphet uses machine learning classifier known as random forest to classify the node as a good forwarder or a bad forwarder based on the supplied contextual information during each routing decision. The classifier trained with large amount of data extracted using simulation leads to precise classification of the nodes as reliable or unreliable nodes for carrying out the routing task. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms with respect to delivery probability, hop count, overhead ratio, latency but over costs with respect to average buffer time in par with similar multi-copy routing algorithms.

This is a result of poorly managed fleets, caused by varying demands and rigid schedules. In this paper, we present an intelligent real-time transport information system to keep commuters informed about the status of buses currently in transit, and also provide an insight to bus managers based on ridership data and commuter behavior. The system is composed of three subsystems designed to cater for commuters, bus-drivers and bus managers respectively. This system is developed on the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform Firebase. Furthermore, a neural network is trained to provide predictions to bus managers on the expected ridership numbers per route. The trained model is integrated with a web application for bus managers. An Android application used by bus drivers collects the ridership data being fed to the network. The proposed system was evaluated with a real-world data set that contains the daily ridership on a per-route basis dating back to 2001. Evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the new system in reducing the total mileage used to deliver commuters, reducing fuel costs, increasing the profit of bus operators, and increasing the percentage of satisfied ridership requests.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-58817-5_47,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Starting from a set of 3.23 million user-generated event logs of a bus ticketing platform, the methodology shows the correlation rules between travel features and the purchase of a ticket. Such rules are then used to train a machine learning model for predicting whether a user will buy or not a ticket. The results obtained by this study reveal that factors such as occupancy rate, fare of a ticket, and number of days passed from booking to departure, have significant influence on traveler’s buying decisions.

However, when they are frequently charged, they also enable societal benefits (emissions- and noise-related) associated with electric buses. Thanks to geofencing, pure electric drive of PH buses can be assigned to specific locations via a back-office system. As a result, PH buses not only can fulfil zero-emission (ZE) zones set by city authorities, but they can also minimize total energy use thanks to selection of locations favouring (from energy perspective) electric drive. Such a location-controlled behaviour allows executing targeted air quality improvement and noise reduction strategies as well reducing energy consumption. However, current ZE zone assignment strategies used by PH buses are static—they are based on the first-come-first serve rule and do not consider traffic conditions. In this article, we propose a novel recommendation system, based on artificial intelligence, that allows PH buses operating efficiently in a dynamic environment, making the best use of the available resources so that emission- and noise-pollution levels are minimized.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-41913-4_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We present the concept of “aesthetic affordance” [ 1 ] and propose interaction aesthetics and user scenarios as valid frameworks for designing AI mobility devices for elderly users. The term “affordance” in this specific case study is seen as bringing together the capability of a device to enable a specific action [ 2 ] and the possibility of that device to communicate a certain meaning [ 3 ]. We stress out how the smart wheelchairs, which successfully convey their actual mobility support function, can help the elderly people become more easily accepted as active citizens by the rest of the community. In this sense the aesthetics of the product have an equal importance to the innovative AI implementations. An initial review of the existent AI augmented wheelchairs revealed an overall lack of concern about the aesthetic functions of the mobility devices and more important the lack of consideration of how the person using it is perceived by the rest of the society. To support this argument we present the different design and development phases of a new concept for the working prototype of a wheelchair created for a large Japanese company. Although the concept has received international acclaim from the design community, we suggest that the most important feature of the product, that of addressing the important ergonomic issue of aesthetic affordance, is still left implicit and needs further investigation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-50334-5_23,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These settlements are witness to rampant violations of safety measures such as Floor Space Index, building bye laws and regulations, social infrastructure and adequate public spaces. The exposure to hazards is further escalated due to increasing population density vis a vis the carrying capacity of the land. The demand for urban services has increased disproportionately in comparison to the capacity of the institutions responsible for providing these services.

We applied the well-trained CNN model to extract built-up areas of Chengdu, Xi’an, Zhengzhou, Harbin, Hefei, Wuhan, Kunming and Fuzhou, for the sake of evaluating the generalization ability of the CNN. The fine classification results of the eight sites indicate that the generalization ability of the well-trained CNN is pretty good.

Mobility data are highly sensitive. Therefore, the correct identification of the privacy risk before releasing the data to the public is of utmost importance. However, existing privacy risk assessment frameworks have high computational complexity. To tackle these issues, some recent work proposed a solution based on classification approaches to predict privacy risk using mobility features extracted from the data. In this paper, we propose an improvement of this approach by applying long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the privacy risk directly from original mobility data. We empirically evaluate privacy risk on real data by applying our LSTM-based approach. Results show that our proposed method based on a LSTM network is effective in predicting the privacy risk with results in terms of F1 of up to 0.91. Moreover, to explain the predictions of our model, we employ a state-of-the-art explanation algorithm, Shap .

Among different interactions, retail delivery services, like home delivery or door-to-door delivery, have gained importance in recent years, being now a competitive advantage. However, this interaction is expensive because of the distances that must be traveled, and it could incur in low service levels due to the large number of orders that might not be covered completely. The use of mobile warehouses constitutes a good approach to solve retail delivery logistics problems. Mobile warehouses are vehicles that drive around the city, perform the delivery to the final customer and manage the administrative tasks such as billing and collecting money. This delivery strategy requires to know the number of products that the vehicle should carry in order to satisfy the demand without returning to the distribution center. This study presents a methodology for demand forecasting and inventory management in a mobile warehouse. Different forecasting methods were used, but artificial neural networks showed the best performance to forecast demand using mobile warehouses. Once the demand forecast is determined, a linear programing optimization model is proposed for inventory management with the aim to reduce the total cost of stock out occurrences in terms of traveling distance to the distribution center, time expended, and lost cost sale. A case study from an Ecuadorian company in Quito is presented, in which the number of products that the vehicle should carry is determined minimizing the stock out occurrences.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-26488-8_8,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper we present a machine learning based methodology to model traffic flow in metropolitan areas with the final aim to address short-term traffic forecasting at various time horizons. Specifically, we introduce an ad-hoc neural network model (GBNN, Graph Based Neural Network) that mirrors the topology of the urban graph: neurons corresponds to intersections, connections to roads, and signals to traffic flow. Furthermore, we enrich each neuron with a memory buffer and a recurrent self loop, to model congestion and allow each neuron to base its prediction on previous local data. We created a GBNN model for a major Italian city and fed it one year worth of fine-grained real data.

PID controllers are an integral and most commonly used tuning method for control over non-linear systems due to their simplicity and ease of computational complexity. PID controllers are most useful to systems in real time in which the system control parameters vary very slowly or exhibit uncertainty consequently making prediction very complicated and delayed. Continuous and quick adaptation of PID controllers towards varying input determines the efficiency of the non-linear system and this research paper presents a radial basis neural network model in a chaotic configuration for tuning the PID controller in an adaptive manner.

This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72 -related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with ( n  = 34) or without ( n  = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects ( n  = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [ VEGFA ]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [ CDKL1 ]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [ EEF2K ]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [ SGSM3 ]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator ( SGSM3 ) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72 -linked diseases.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40478-019-0797-0,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The estimation of future waste generation rates can help to motivate for analyzing gaps in existing waste management and better planning strategies. Improper management and unsafe disposal of solid waste create a threat to the environment and human health. Hence, a sound forecasting of solid waste generation is very crucial for planning and management accordingly. Artificial intelligence is an excellent and new application of soft computing which is used as a forecasting tool. The main objective of this study is to apply ANN time series model along with autoregressive technique to forecast the monthly solid waste generation in Kolkata. For the same, data related to the monthly solid waste generation was gathered from 2010 to 2017. Total data of 96 months were divided into three categories, i.e., 70%, 15%, and 15% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. The model was evaluated based on performance value of mean square error, root mean square error, and regression coefficient. The ANN structure of 1-19-1 was considered as optimized model for solid waste forecasting because it has the lowest mean square error and the highest regression coefficient.

State-of-the-art open source libraries are used for each emulation method while the CPU-time incurred by one forward run of the considered RTMs varies from 1 h to between 1 h and 30 min and 5 days. Besides direct emulation of the simulated uranium concentration time series, replacing the original RTM by its emulator is also investigated for global sensitivity analysis (GSA), uncertainty propagation, and probabilistic calibration using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The selected DNN is found to be superior to both GPs and PCE in reproducing the input–output behavior of the considered 8-dimensional and 13-dimensional CPU-intensive RTMs. This even though the used training sets are small, from 75 to 500 samples. Furthermore, the two used PCE variants, standard PCE and sparse PCE (sPCE), appear to always provide the least accuracy while not differing much in performance. As a consequence of its better emulation capabilities, the DNN method outperforms the two other methods for uncertainty propagation. For the GSA application, the DNN and GP methods offer equally good approximations to the true first-order and total-order Sobol’ sensitivity indices while PCE does less well. Most surprisingly, despite its superior emulation skills, the DNN approach leads to the worst solution of the considered synthetic inverse problem which involves 1224 measurement data with low noise. This apparently contradicting behavior of the used DNN is at least partially due to the small but complicated deterministic noise that affects the DNN-based predictions. Indeed, this complex error structure can drive the emulated solutions far away from the true posterior distribution in case of high-quality measurement data. Among the considered 3 methods, only the GP method allows for retrieving emulated posterior solutions that jointly (1) fit the high-quality measurement data to the appropriate noise level (log-likelihood value) and (2) most closely fit the true model parameter values. Overall, our findings indicate that when the available training set is relatively small (75 to 500 input-output examples) and fixed beforehand, PCE is not the best choice for emulating CPU-intensive RTMs. Instead, GPs or DNNs should be preferred.

Exiting studies on urban noise recognition are mostly based on conventional acoustic features, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC), and the shallow structure based classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM). However, the urban acoustic environment is complicated and changeable. Conventional acoustic representation and recognition methods may be insufficient in characterizing urban noises, and generally suffer from a degraded performance. In this paper, we study the recent deep neural network based urban noise recognition. The log-Mel-spectrogram, namely, the FBank feature is first derived for acoustic representation. Then, the FBank spectrum constructed with a set of FBank feature vectors from multiple acoustic signal frames is fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for urban noise recognition. Comprehensive studies on the dimension of FBank spectrums and the parameters in CNN, including the size of learnable kernels, the dropout rate, and the activation function, etc., are presented in the paper. An acoustic database collected in real environment covering 11 most common urban noises with more than 56,000 samples is constructed for model verification and performance evaluation. In addition, the traditional LPCC and MFCC acoustic feature combining with two popular machine learning algorithms, extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM), and the FBank image feature combining with extreme learning machine (ELM), hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) and multilayer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM), have also been presented for discussions.

There are currently no studies on identifying the territorial structure of Russia’s future digital economy. Due to the inertia of the existing settlement system and the agglomeration economy, it has been assumed that the future territorial structure will be represented by smart urban agglomerations and regions. It has been established that the most critical parameter for controlling smart objects is signal delay in telecommunication networks. It has been proposed to draw the borders of digital agglomerations and regions based on isochrons of 1 and 10 ms delays with adjustment of borders for the extreme proximity or remoteness of regional centers. The signal delay between 1112 cities of Russia has been determined. Forty-three digital agglomerations and 45 regions were selected. The results can be used to create a development strategy for Russia’s digital economy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1134/S207997051904004X,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This work proposed that a continuous deep belief neural network (CDBNN) model based on the chaotic theory should be implemented to predict the daily water demand time series in Zhuzhou, China.

First, the power spectrum and the largest Lyapunov exponent is used to determine the chaotic characteristic of the daily water demand time series. Second, C–C method is utilized to reconstruct the water demand time series’ phase space. Lastly, the forecasting model should be produced with the continuous deep belief network and neural network algorithms implemented for feature learning and regression, respectively, and the CDBNN input established by the best embedding dimension of the reconstructed phase space. The proposed method is contrasted with the support vector regression, generalized regression neural networks and feed forward neural networks, and they are accepted with the identical dataset.

To model the growth of Chennai city, we have used cellular automata-based urban growth models based on the historical datasets. In the present study, urban growth of Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) was predicted for the year 2017 based on 2010 and 2013 dataset and Chennai city master plan using neural-network-coupled agent-based cellular automata (NNACA) model. Eight different agents of urbanization including transportation, hotspots, and industries were used in the prediction modeling. On validating the 2017 predicted outputs, NNACA model with hotspots proved to be better (hits: 498.52 km^2) than that of without hotspots (hits: 488.31 km^2). Out of the total eight agents of urbanization, the most influencing agent of urbanization of 2017 was identified to be the neighborhood of ‘Existing built-up of 2013’ using ‘sensitivity analysis’. Further, the urban sprawl of CMA for 2010, 2013 and 2017 was measured through Shannon’s entropy. The study area was divided into five directional and distance-based zones with the State Secretariat as the center.

This study investigates the ability of dynamic neural networks, particularly the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) network, in predicting air carbon monoxide concentration in Shiraz in the absence of traffic data since there are no accurate statistical data on traffic volume (as one of the primary sources for air pollution modeling). Dynamic networks have been utilized to model time-variable patterns as they have time memory through the history of concentration volume implicitly containing traffic characteristics. To begin this study, meteorological data including temperature, moisture content, rainfall amount, and wind velocity and direction at a 3-h mean basis were obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology at the Shiraz Airport. Moreover, air pollutant concentration data due to Setad Square’s measurement station between 2005 and 2008 were prepared from the Fars Department of Environmental Protection. According to the results obtained from the static neural network, the correlation coefficients ( R ) for the training, validation, and test datasets are estimated as 0.49, 0.37, and 0.41, respectively. Moreover, the R ^2 correlation coefficient, the root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.31, 0.43, and 51%, respectively.

However outside of the human body many of these communities remain poorly studied. The Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes (MetaSUB) International Consortium is characterizing the microbiomes of urban environments with the aim to improve design of mass transit systems. As part of the CAMDA 2018 MetaSUB Forensics Challenge 311 city microbiome samples were provided to create urban microbial fingerprints, as well as a further 3 mystery datasets for validation. Results MetaSUB samples were clustered using t-SNE in an unsupervised fashion to almost discrete groups, which upon inspection represented city of origin. Based on this clustering, geographically close metropolitan areas appear to display similar microbial profiles such as those of Auckland and Hamilton. Mystery unlabeled samples were provided part of the challenge. A random forest classifier built on the initial dataset of 311 samples was capable of correctly classifying 83.3% of the mystery samples to their city of origin. Random Forest analyses also identified features with the highest discriminatory power, ranking bacterial species such as Campylobacter jejuni and Staphylococcus argenteus as highly predictive of city of origin. The surface from which the sample was collected displayed little detectable impact on the microbial profiles in the data generated here. The proportion of reads classified per sample varied greatly and so de-novo assembly was applied to recover genomic fragments representing organisms not captured in reference databases. Conclusions Current methods can differentiate urban microbiome profiles from each other with relative ease. De-novo assembly indicated that the MetaSUB metagenomic data contains adequate depth to recover metagenomic assembled genomes and that current databases are not sufficient to fully characterize urban microbiomes. Profiles found here indicate there may be a relationship between geographical distance between areas and the urban microbiome composition although this will need further research. The impact of these different profiles on public health is currently unknown but the MetaSUB consortium is uniquely suited to evaluate these and provide a roadmap for the inclusion of urban microbiome information for city planning and public health policy.

Representing the system as a complex network, in which nodes are assigned to regions ( e . g ., a city) and links indicate the flow of people between two of them, physics-inspired models have been proposed to quantify the number of people migrating from one city to the other. Despite the advances made by these models, our ability to predict the number of commuters and reconstruct mobility networks remains limited. Here, we propose an alternative approach using machine learning and 22 urban indicators to predict the flow of people and reconstruct the intercity commuters network. Our results reveal that predictions based on machine learning algorithms and urban indicators can reconstruct the commuters network with 90.4% of accuracy and describe 77.6% of the variance observed in the flow of people between cities. We also identify essential features to recover the network structure and the urban indicators mostly related to commuting patterns. As previously reported, distance plays a significant role in commuting, but other indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate, are also driven-forces for people to commute. We believe that our results shed new lights on the modeling of migration and reinforce the role of urban indicators on commuting patterns. Also, because link-prediction and network reconstruction are still open challenges in network science, our results have implications in other areas, like economics, social sciences, and biology, where node attributes can give us information about the existence of links connecting entities in the network.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48295-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The performance of all models were measured by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive prognostic value (PPV), negative prognostic value (NPV), the area under curve (AUC), and were validated using bootstrap resampling. Results The average age of AD group was about 5 years older than the non-AD controls ( P  < 0.001). Patients with AD included a significantly larger proportion of subjects with family history of dementia, compared with non-AD group. After adjusting for age and gender, the concentrations of urinary AD7c-NTP and aluminum in blood were significantly higher in AD group than non-AD group (2.01 ± 1.06 vs 1.03 ± 0.43, 1.74 ± 0.62 vs 1.24 ± 0.41 respectively), but the concentration of Selenium in AD group (2.26 ± 0.59) was significantly lower than that in non-AD group (2.61 ± 1.07).

Object detection follows the lightning strike pattern of the lightning flashes on different air terminals installed on multi-geometrical scaled structures. Initially, classification is carried out based on the object characteristics into different categories. In the proposed approach, the classification of buildings has been carried out on the basis of various states of terminals of different buildings. The proposed approach consists of four stages namely data collection, data labeling, classification; and performance evaluation.

The authors apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to control coherent transport of quantum states in arrays of quantum dots and demonstrate that DRL can solve the control problem in the absence of a known analytical solution even under disturbance conditions. Some problems in physics can be handled only after a suitable ansatz solution has been guessed, proving to be resilient to generalization. The coherent transport of a quantum state by adiabatic passage through an array of semiconductor quantum dots is an excellent example of such a problem, where it is necessary to introduce a so-called counterintuitive control sequence. Instead, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique has proven to be able to solve very complex sequential decision-making problems, despite a lack of prior knowledge. We show that DRL discovers a control sequence that outperforms the counterintuitive control sequence. DRL can even discover novel strategies when realistic disturbances affect an ideal system, such as detuning or when dephasing or losses are added to the master equation. DRL is effective in controlling the dynamics of quantum states and, more generally, whenever an ansatz solution is unknown or insufficient to effectively treat the problem.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-019-0169-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The accurate resolution of flow and transport behavior on a large DFN involving thousands of fractures is computationally expensive. This makes uncertainty quantification studies of quantities of interest such as travel time through the network computationally intractable, since hundreds to thousands of runs of the DFN model are required to get bounds on the uncertainty of the predictions. Prior works on the subject demonstrated that the complexity of a DFN could be reduced by considering a sub-network of it (often termed a “backbone” sub-network), one whose flow and transport properties were then shown to be similar to that of the full network. The technique is tantamount to partitioning the complete set of fractures of a network into two disjoint sets, one of which is the backbone sub-network while the other its complement. It is in this context that we present a system-reduction technique for DFNs using supervised machine learning via a Random Forest Classifier that selects a backbone sub-network from the full set of fractures. The in-sample errors (in terms of precision and recall scores) of the trained classifier are found to be very accurate indicators of the out-of-sample errors, thus exhibiting that the classifier generalizes well to test data. Moreover, this system-reduction technique yields sub-networks as small as 12% of the full DFN that still recover transport characteristics of the full network such as the peak dosage and tailing behavior for late times. Most importantly, the sub-networks remain connected, and their size can be controlled by a single dimensionless parameter. Furthermore, measures of KL-divergence and KS-statistic for the breakthrough curves of the sub-networks with respect to the full network show physically realistic trends in that the measures decrease monotonically as the size of the sub-networks increase. The computational efficiency gained by this technique depends on the size of the sub-network, but large reductions in computational time can be expected for small sub-networks, yielding as much as 90% computational savings for sub-networks that are as small as 10-12% of the full network.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10596-019-9811-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Using MATLAB R2016a software modeling tools to establish GM (1, 1) model and RBF neural network model, respectively, this paper predicted the demand of urban-industrial land in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration. Comparing the predicated results with the actual value of urban-industrial land in Beijing, Tianjin, and 11 prefecture-level cities in Hebei Province, we determined the reasonable prediction model for urban-industrial land after testing the accuracy of the two prediction models. The results showed that the RBF neural network model was the more reasonable prediction model for urban-industrial land. Using the predicted results of the RBF neural network model, combining expected indicators of overall land use plan (2006–2020) in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as 11 prefecture-level cities in Hebei Province in the planning target year, determined remaining usable time of urban-industrial land. Finally, combined with the actual scale of urban-industrial land in 2015 and the predicated scale of urban-industrial land in 2020, the remaining usable time of each city’s urban-industrial land was calculated in terms of the average annual growth rate of urban-industrial land from 2009 to 2015. According to the comparative relationship between the remaining usable time and the remaining time of the overall land use plan (5 years), urban-industrial lands were divided into three kinds of regulation zones: reasonable reduction zone, optimized adjustment zone, and core development zone. The policy implications for urban-industrial land in each regulation zone were also provided.

Few studies addressed how socioeconomic and landscape factors, especially at micro-scale for mosquito life history, determine mosquito abundance. Objectives We aim to predict mosquito abundance based on socioeconomic and/or landscape factors using machine learning framework. Additionally, we determine these factors’ response to mosquito abundance. Methods We identified 3985 adult mosquitoes (majority of which were Aedes mosquitoes) in 90 sampling sites from Charlotte, NC, USA in 2017. Seven socioeconomic and seven landscape factors were used to predict mosquito abundance. Three supervised learning models, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were constructed, tuned, and evaluated using both continuous input factors and binary inputs. Random forest (RF) was used to assess individual input’s relative importance and response to mosquito abundance. Results We showed that landscape factors alone yielded equal or better predictability than socioeconomic factors. The inclusion of both types of factors further improved model accuracy using binary inputs. kNN also had robust performance regardless of inputs (accuracy > 95% for binary and > 99% for continuous input data). Landscape factors group had higher importance than socioeconomic group (54.4% vs. 45.6%). Landscape heterogeneity (measured by Shannon index) was the single most important input factor for mosquito abundance. Conclusions Landscape factors were the key for mosquito abundance. Machine learning models were powerful tools to handle complex datasets with multiple socioeconomic and landscape factors to accurately predict mosquito abundance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10980-019-00839-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The first module contains a set of algorithms to process traffic flow data. After analysis and repair, a complete data set without outliers is provided as well as a data set containing pairs of road segments that are the most similar to each other in regard to their trends. The second module focuses on multiple time-step short-term forecasting. With a good understanding of the periodicity and randomness of traffic flow, the time series is first decomposed into a trend series and residual series. After reconstructing the two time series, model training and prediction based on a long short-term memory-recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) are performed.

It is very suitable for the complex of short-term traffic flow forecasting; however, BPNN is easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence. In order to overcome these deficiencies, a new approach called social emotion optimization algorithm (SEOA) is proposed in this paper to optimize the linked weights and thresholds of BPNN. Each individual in SEOA represents a BPNN. The availability of the proposed forecasting models is proved with the actual traffic flow data of the 2nd Ring Road of Beijing. Experiment of results show that the forecasting accuracy of SEOA is improved obviously as compared with the accuracy of particle swarm optimization back-propagation (PSOBP) and simulated annealing particle swarm optimization back-propagation (SAPSOBP) models. Furthermore, since SEOA does not respond to the negative feedback information, Metropolis rule is proposed to give consideration to both positive and negative feedback information and diversify the adjustment methods. The modified BPNN model, in comparison with social emotion optimization back-propagation (SEOBP) model, is more advantageous to search the global optimal solution.

This paper aims to conduct performance analysis of deep learning based algorithm i.e. single shot detector (SSD) in IoT based embedded devices for smart home appliances control. We have developed a smart home automation system using object detection algorithm based on model view controller (MVC) architecture deployed on Cloud of Things (CoT) i.e. Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud for users to remotely monitor their homes.

The results are vital when it comes to health concern issues related to air pollution in developing countries like India and China. The present study is focused on the prediction of future concentrations of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM, also called PM_2.5) and suspended particulate matter (SPM, also called PM_10) using the artificial neural networks (ANN) over tropical inland industrial site, Rourkela. Rourkela, popularly known as steel city of India is situated at the heart of a rich mineral belt and is endowed with many small, medium and large scale industries. This study aims to develop a seasonal ANN modelling approach for prediction of RSPM and SPM for the year 2013 by using the datasets of meteorology and RSPM and SPM concentrations covered from 2009 to 2013. Four neural network models namely, wavelet-based multi-layer perceptron feed forward neural network (WMLPNN), wavelet-based recurrent neural network, multi-layer perceptron feed forward neural network (MLPNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are used. The networks are trained using daily data from 2009 to 2012 on a seasonal basis, and daily predictions are performed for 2013 using seasonal based trained model. Five meteorological variables [temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), boundary layer height (BLH), surface pressure (SP), wind direction (WD) and wind speed (WS)] along with the Daubechies wavelet decomposed coefficients are considered as predictor variables in the models. A lagged scheme is introduced in wind speed input vector and networks are trained and tested up to 3 days lagged wind speed variable which greatly improved the prediction accuracy. WMLPNN is found to be outperforming all other tested schemes by providing promising results among all the tested models with lag in pre-monsoon, monsoon and winter seasons and without lag in wind speed for the post-monsoon season for both RSPM and SPM, elucidating the importance of predictor wind speed in the models. The values of R^2 varied from 0.6 to 0.91 for RSPM and 0.7 to 0.98 for SPM and RMSE values varied from 0.09 to 0.14 for RSPM and 0.03 to 0.13 for SPM for WMLPNN model.

The approach is characterized by design goals like “keeping the human in the loop and in control” and the proposal that “smart spaces make people smarter”. The critical reflection implies to ‘redefine’ the ‘smart-everything’ paradigm. One could also say this is a proposal in the spirit of humanized computing. While the approach has general applicability, the examples are mainly taken from the domain of employing information technology in current and future urban environments, where one can observe an increasing hype indicated by the label ‘smart cities’. The paper argues that a citizen-centered design approach for future cities is needed for going beyond technology-driven ubiquitous instrumentations and installations of cities. To illustrate the situation, the paper addresses several general problem sets concerning artificial intelligence and algorithmic automation as well as privacy issues. There are two trade-offs to be considered: (a) between human control and automation, and (b) between privacy and smartness. People are not asked anymore beforehand for their permission to collect and process their personal data. People do not have the choice to decide and make the trade-off decision between smartness and privacy themselves but are confronted with serious privacy infringements. To remedy the situation, a ‘privacy by design’, respectively ‘privacy by default’ approach is proposed. The combination of redefining the ‘smart-everything’ paradigm in terms of empowering people, employing privacy by design and enforcing an overall citizen-centered design approach is guided by the goal of reconciling people and technology, creating and maintaining a balance of decision-making and control entities.

The pixel values of all the maps was extracted to the random points for the scatter plot and kernel analysis. The results obtained by developing the change transition model using multi-layer perceptron neural network showed high accuracy in most of the sub-models. The area of the open lands and green spaces was reduced, and urban areas, agricultural lands, and clay plains were increased.

Canadian Drinking Water Guidelines and other indices are used to evaluate TDS concentrations in 27 monitoring wells surrounding the landfill. This study aims to predict TDS concentrations using three different modeling approaches: dual-step multiple linear regression (MLR), hybrid principal component regression (PCR), and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN). An analysis of the bias and precision of each models follows, using performance evaluation metrics and statistical indices. TDS is one of the most important parameters in assessing suitability of water for irrigation, and for overall groundwater quality assessment. Good agreement was observed between the MLR1 model and field data, although multicollinearity issues exist. Percentage errors of hybrid PCR were comparable to the dual-step MLR method. Percentage error for hybrid PCR was found to be inversely proportional to TDS concentrations, which was not observed for dual-step MLR. Larger errors were obtained from the BPNN models, and higher percentage errors were observed in monitoring wells with lower TDS concentrations. All models in this study adequately describe the data in testing stage ( R ^2 > 0.86). Generally, the dual-step MLR and hybrid PCR models fared better ( R ^2_avg = 0.981 and 0.974, respectively), while BPNN models performed worse ( R ^2_avg = 0.904). For this dataset, both regression and machine learning models are more suited to predict mid-range data compared to extreme values. Advanced regression methods (hybrid PCR and dual-step MLR) are more advantageous compared to BPNN.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-018-3751-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this regard, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for optimizing urban traffic control (UTC) based on the real-time traffic conditions. One of the RL-based algorithms is Distributed W-Learning (DWL) in which each agent has multiple policies and then this agent learns to optimize the traffic light control (green, red and so on) based on these policies. In this context, there are situations in which it is only necessary for the control agent to achieve its own policy, and other situations where the priority must be given to the performance of other control agents. As a result, DWL is able to learn how to optimize the entire UTC. In addition, DWL has a mediator that informs the control agents the traffic volume of each road, and these agents learn based on that information. However, the limitation of DWL is that it is based on Q-learning, therefore, it is difficult to optimize multiple policies when the control area expands. In addition, because the action values are represented by tables, these tables grow exponentially when applied to large-scale action spaces. Likewise, the ability to adapt to new environments becomes poor. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. The proposed approach uses Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm in order to optimize the traffic conditions more flexibly. The proposed approach utilizes deep learning for value function approximation. Therefore, the proposed approach has the advantage of being highly extensible and capable of predicting an action in large-scale action spaces even in unknown environments. The experimental results show the proposed approach is capable of optimizing multiple policies of the UTC, efficiently.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-29894-4_28,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The key issue in the waste management is that the garbage bin at public places gets overflowed well in advance before the commencement of the next cleaning process. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odor and ugliness to that place which may be the root cause for spread of various diseases. The increase in population, has led to tremendous degradation in the state of affairs of hygiene with respect to waste management system. The spillover of waste in civic areas generates the polluted condition in the neighboring areas. For eliminating or mitigating the garbage’s and maintains the cleanness, it requires smartness based waste management system. The need of proper waste management does not end with just collection and proper dispose of garbage. It continues to the level of landfills and the amount that we can possibly recycle. Recycling is estimated to be highly useful given that our dependency on raw products reduces, besides the reduction of waste and subsequent landfills. Once the recycling is done to sort metals, plastics, and glass articles, the use of biodegradable waste can be extended beyond fertilizers and manure. The metals can be reused and the plastics can be diverted from the landfills, which otherwise leads to choking of the earth.

Thinking this way, Intelligent Transportation Systems, a key area in smart cities, uses computational intelligence techniques and analyses to aid in traffic dimensioning solutions. In this context, accurate traffic prediction models are vital to creating a more autonomous and intelligent environment. With an increase in projects for intelligent cities, research in the area of computational intelligence becomes a necessity, since its models can address complex real-world problems, which are usually difficult for conventional methods. In this work, an application is introduced applying machine learning to empower a smart ecosystem. To validate it, an extensive evaluation was performed, comparing it with the state-of-the-art and, also, verifying the impact of parameter variation and activation functions on the model of traffic flow prediction. All evaluations were done using real data traffic of two very distinct scenarios. Firstly, a free traffic flow scenario was evaluated in a benchmark dataset. Then, both models were evaluated in a complex traffic scenario where traffic flow is not continuous nor large.

With the ever-increasing traffic and its various types, it has become increasingly difficult to check if the road network can sustain the surge. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of a network, several factors such as speed, vehicular composition, traffic volume are required. Data collection for calculating each of these factors is time-consuming. Most of the current activities in the area of intelligent transportation systems involve the collection of data through various sources such as surveillance cameras, but the collection alone is not sufficient. It requires a lot of time to process this data and determine the safety level of the road network which becomes manifold for a country with a vast network like India. It is a necessity to expand the use of intelligent transportation for the processing of the data. To achieve this initially, it is required to have traffic flow data. Therefore, high-resolution video cameras were placed at vantage points approximately 100–150 m away from the center of intersection locations. Two such intersections were selected from the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. Traffic flow-related data was recorded from 10 am to 4 pm during good weather condition. The obtained videos were then processed to segregate different types of vehicles. The proposed algorithm deals with the vehicles which are up to 70% occluded. A CNN-LSTM (Krizhevsky et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, pp 1097–1105, 2012 [ 6 ]) model is trained for the recognition of a vehicle.

Nowadays, the abundance of satellite images moved the problem to an analytic point of view. Satellite imagery actors are currently dealing with data storage and distribution of added-value products. In this context, we present a scalable semi-automatic tool for urban detection: it is qualified with different image sources, different databases (proprietary, open source, detailed, basic etc.). The aim is not to exhaustively map buildings from a satellite image, but to give an overview of the situation regarding urban areas. It is conceived to guide stakeholders and producers throughout the updating process. The workflow presented in this article is based on existing algorithms and software resources so the application could be tested quickly on various landscapes with different sensors, in a demanding industrial context. The process is generic and adaptable, with a phase of uncorrelation, chaining a Minimum Noise Fraction transformation with a textural analysis, a learning phase, processed from an existing database, and an automatic modelling of the detected objects. The results are quantified to assess the product’s quality: 90% of the existing database is successfully recreated with less than 1% rate of potential big omissions. The method allows to detect destroyed buildings and has run in “real” updating operations, on Spot6 images (1.5 and 6 m resolution), Pleiades (1.5 and 2 m), Landsat-8 (15 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-06010-7_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Drivers are likely to move slowly and waste time on the road for an available on-street parking space if parking slot availability information is not revealed in advanced.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on recurrent network and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict parking multi-steps ahead.

Decisions are constantly made on sensing, mapping and driving policy using machine learning techniques. Deep Learning – massive neural networks that utilize the power of parallel processing – has become a popular choice for addressing the complexities of real time decision making. This method of machine learning has been shown to outperform alternative solutions in multiple domains, and has an architecture that can be adapted to new problems with relative ease. To harness the power of Deep Learning, it is necessary to have large amounts of training data that are representative of all possible situations the system will face. To successfully implement situational awareness in driverless vehicles, it is not possible to exhaust all possible training examples. An alternative method is to apply cognitive approaches to perception, for situations the autonomous vehicles will face. Cognitive approaches to perception work by mimicking the process of human intelligence – thereby permitting a machine to react to situations it has not previously experienced. This paper proposes a novel cognitive approach for object recognition. The proposed cognitive object recognition algorithm, referred to as Recognition by Components, is inspired by the psychological studies pertaining to early childhood development. The algorithm works by breaking down images into a series of primitive forms such as square, triangle, circle or rectangle and memory based aggregation to identify objects.

Internet and mobile devices let us produce and consult information related to social and urban aspects. The crowd sourcing information and the social computing analyze and implement solutions to real world problems using the web content generated by social media and internet users. One of the urban factors that affect people’s activities is the vehicular traffic, every day traffic produces high stress levels and time delays when people are trying to move from one place to another using their cities highway. Vehicular traffic problems impact directly over the human’s health and over the financial dynamics of the affected cities. In the present approach, social computing is implemented by analyzing crowd sourcing information related to vehicular traffic, and computing regressions over the identified traffic events, to determine how traffic would affect an urban area at different hours. The consulted crowd sourcing information is obtained from Twitter. The traffic events forecast is implemented using a machine learning regression algorithm; the retrieved data from the social network and the regression progress results are visualized in the study area’s map, using a geographic information system. The goal of the geospatial visualization is show to the citizens the places where traffic events probably would occur, giving them the opportunity to change their routes avoiding traffic problems.

Given the peculiarities of temporal data, their management typically requires the use of dedicated algorithms, that make the overall data mining process complex, especially in those cases in which a dataset is characterised by both temporal and atemporal information. In such a situation, typical solutions include combining different algorithms for the independent handling of the temporal and atemporal parts, or relying on an encoding of temporal data that makes it possible to apply classical machine learning algorithms (such as with the use of lagged variables). This work investigates the management of temporal information in an environmental problem, that is, assessing the relationships between concentrations of the pollutants $$NO_2$$ , $$NO_X$$ , and $$PM_{2.5}$$ , and a set of independent variables that include meteorological conditions and traffic flow in the city of Wrocław (Poland).

The term “artificial intelligence” has been challenged as connoting emotional intelligence that humans possess. Scientists cannot even imagine a time where computers would acquire emotional intelligence. IBM advocates terms such as “cognitive computing” or “augmented intelligence” to describe what is popularly known as AI for this reason. In this context, AI forms two broad categories: knowledge based intelligence delivered by knowledge based systems (KBS) and computational intelligence which involve neural networks fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing. The former is applied based on the reliance placed by information provided by a human (such as rules and algorithms) while the latter delivers through networks of computational systems. Air transport involves the use of qualitative and quantitative data but is primarily governed by human involvement, whether in maintenance, air traffic control or flight deck management.

To address these problems, use of information communication technology-based transport systems that can support maximum utilization of the existing road transport infrastructure has been proposed by different researchers. Road monitoring systems are one of these solutions which support road users to make informed decisions. However, the current road traffic monitoring systems use road side infrastructures for road traffic data collection and these technologies lack accurate and up-to-date traffic data covering the whole road network. By comparison, cellular networks are already widely deployed and can provide large road network coverage. Besides, 3G and 4G cellular networks provide mobile phone positioning facility with better performance accuracy and this opportunity can help to obtain accurate traffic flow information in cost effective manner on the entire road networks.

We are seeing significant advances in the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles and an immense surge of shared mobility services, such as bike-sharing and ride-sourcing services like Uber- all promising to improve the life of the average urban commuter. There are significant obstacles to the deployment and/or full utilization of these technologies, however, which could be mitigated with an additional layer of transportation system monitoring. This chapter introduces the use of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV), or drones, as the cornerstone of an advanced and proactive new intelligent transportation system (ITS) called, iTRANS. This new approach will reveal important traffic variables that are currently unpredictable, as well as solve most jurisdictional conflicts of interest, and regulatory constraints. Furthermore, iTRANS is designed to be one of the main tools to complete a successful transition from a dysfunctional transportation system to an optimal linear programming one in which transportation supply and demand is proactively managed through advanced ITS software. This sophisticated ITS system, connected to open software platforms, would gather and integrate all available information from the different modes of transportation, allowing real-time traffic management of the entire transportation system, as a whole. In addition, this chapter addresses the current technologies, urban transportation challenges related to autonomous vehicles, and describes the multifaceted approach of iTRANS and how its application would be advantageous in the deployment of autonomous vehicles.

However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Network s, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM ), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-67807-8_14,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We developed a computational model capable of simulating drug-coated balloon delivery to arteries of heterogeneous tissue composition comprising healthy tissue, as well as regions of fibrous, fibro-fatty, calcified and necrotic core lesions. Image processing using an unsupervised clustering technique was used to reconstruct an arterial geometry from a single, patient-specific color image obtained from intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual histology. Transport of free drug was modeled using a time-dependent reaction-diffusion model and the bound, immobilized drug using the time-dependent reaction equation. The governing equations representing the transport of free as well as bound drug along with a set of initial settings and boundary conditions were solved numerically using an explicit finite difference scheme that satisfied the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability criterion. Our results support previous findings related to the transport and binding of drug in arteries where tissue retention is strongly dependent on local pharmacologic properties. Additionally, modeling results indicate that non-uniform disease composition leads to heterogeneous arterial drug distribution patterns, although further validation using animal studies is required to fully appreciate pharmacokinetics in disease-laden arteries.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13239-016-0273-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, researches related to spatial−temporal data mining and forecasting on property crime driven by traffic factors are rare. The BP neural network model improved by genetic algorithm (GA−BP neural network), which utilize Machine Learning to mine the factor weights of the property crime, can describe these complicated relationships to forecast more effectively. This study collected spatialtemporal data of property crime that occurred at city A located in South China in the period from 2008 to 2012, filtered the factors of property crime by correlation analysis, and selected the neighbors by spatial autocorrelation. This study also standardized the data, with one year as the time window and 100m×100m as the spatial dimension. Property crime is forecasted based on the GA−BP neural network, and the root mean square error is 0.019. Current researches demonstrate that the correlation between property crime and factors, like urban transport, network density, floating population and economic indicator, is significant. This study confirms that the GA−BP neural network model based on GIS is a reasonable forecast model in the field of property crime forecast research.

The establishment of an appropriate model to estimate potential losses or injuries in earthquake disasters is fundamental to decrease their impacts and losses and effectively respond and mitigate. Turkey as a country that experienced many earthquakes in the last century and had serious human and financial losses needs a comprehensive knowledge of consequences of devastating earthquakes to be able to plan for the future. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have abilities to solve and analyse complex relations as an appropriate method to estimate number of injuries. In this study, an ANN model is built up for the earthquake casualty prediction, which takes earthquake occurrence time, earthquake magnitude, and population density as the predictors and employs 21 Mw > 5 earthquake disasters occurred in Turkey from 1975 as samples for the training of the network. The model was then tested on a study region consisting of four districts in Istanbul which is estimated to have the highest injury rate according to the earlier reports and generated estimations of the expected number of injured people. Results show that 99.9 % of the variability in the number of injured people is predictable with using this ANN model. Comparison of actual values and estimated output values in the ANN model was also found apparently very close to each other. According to the test case study results, when the value of earthquake magnitude is 6.5 Mw, number of injured people has increased in a sharp trend compared to the previous magnitude value (6 Mw) for all districts. Estimated number of injured people in daytime is obtained higher than at night when the earthquake magnitude is 5 and 5.5 Mw. The highest value in estimated number of injured people has emerged in Fatih district as 7241 for a 7.5 Mw daytime earthquake.

Artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed using a combination of numerical model derived meteorological variables and variables indicating emission and circulation type variations for estimating daily SO_2, NO_2, and PM_10 concentrations over urban Lanzhou, Northwestern China. Results indicated that the developed ANN model can satisfactorily reproduce the pollution level and their day-to-day variations, with correlation coefficients between the modeled and the observed daily SO_2, NO_2, and PM_10 ranging from 0.71 to 0.83.

Thereafter, water consumption projection (2013–2020) and uncertainty estimates was done. Results showed that the model matched well with observations. Through reducing the dependence on large amount of information and constructing a probabilistic means incorporating uncertainty estimation, the new approach can work better than conventional means in support of water resources planning and management under an incompletely informational circumstance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00477-015-1081-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In most models, future land-use changes are forecasted based on past development pattern and expansion to periphery. While today, metropolitan areas employ smart-growth strategies. The main objectives in this study are according to the smart-growth infill. In this approach, transmission of incompatible land uses to the outside of the city boundary, redevelopment, improvement, and renovation of urban old district and worn-out texture and reuse of abandoned land to new urban development are considered. In fact, the objective is the using of the infill development pattern to modeling approach for simulating urban future development using potentials inside the city. Methods This paper presents a Land Transformation Model of urban land-use change based on an artificial neural network and a geographical information system. For developing this approach, future development of Tabriz city based on past development trend and infill development pattern is modeled. Results The modeling result based on past development pattern shows that the 31.26 % of green spaces and 60.93 % of agricultural land and wasteland will be destroyed and the built area will increase 89.75 % from 2005 to 2021. Development of infill development pattern model can regularize urban expansion in the coming decades. The result of infill development pattern, show that the built area will increase 40.32 percent and agricultural land and wasteland area decrease 32.67 percent until 2021. Conclusions In fact, redevelopment of urban land uses in infill development pattern until 2021, not only preserve the green spaces and agricultural areas but also improve and rehabilitate old and worn-out textures.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s13717-016-0044-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many existing applications do not have the intelligence embedded to learn about the environmental parameters (such weather, incident etc.) that influence traffic flow; therefore, they are passive to the dynamic nature of vehicle traffic. This report proposes a deep learning neural networks method to optimise traffic flow and reduce congestion at key intersections, which will enhance the ability of signalized intersections to respond to changing traffic and environmental conditions. The input features of the proposed methods are composed of historical data of all the movements of an intended intersection, time series and environmental variables such as weather conditions etc. The method can learn about the region and predict traffic volumes at any point in time. The output (i.e. predicted traffic volume) is fed into the delay equation that generates best green times to manage traffic delay. The performance of our method is measured by root mean squared error (RMSE), against other models: Radial Basic Function, Random Walk, Support Vector Machine and BP Neural Network. Experiments conducted on real datasets show that our deep neural network method outperforms other methods and can be deployed to optimize the operations of traffic signals.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-50127-7_35,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this research, to improve the accuracy of subsurface contaminant prediction spatially and temporally and to assess the impact of first-order decay rate parameter estimation, Kalman filter (KF) embedded with Neural Network (NN) was used in a specified 3-D domain space. The filter is perturbed with random Gaussian noise to reflect real life case of contaminant movement. Set of sparse observation points selected at specific locations are used to guide the filter at every time step to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

Most existing methods for vehicle Re-Id only achieve limited performance, as they predominantly focus on the generic appearance of vehicle while neglecting some unique identities of vehicle (e.g., license plate). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to PROgressive Vehicle re-ID, called “PROVID”. Our approach treats vehicle Re-Id as two specific progressive search processes: coarse-to-fine search in the feature space, and near-to-distant search in the real world surveillance environment. The first search process employs the appearance attributes of vehicle for a coarse filtering, and then exploits the Siamese Neural Network for license plate verification to accurately identify vehicles. The near-to-distant search process retrieves vehicles in a manner like human beings, by searching from near to faraway cameras and from close to distant time. Moreover, to facilitate progressive vehicle Re-Id research, we collect to-date the largest dataset named VeRi-776 from large-scale urban surveillance videos, which contains not only massive vehicles with diverse attributes and high recurrence rate, but also sufficient license plates and spatiotemporal labels. A comprehensive evaluation on the VeRi-776 shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 9.28 % improvements in term of mAP.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6_53,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this situation, this research work propose at using ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) to assess the present condition of daily water consumption and predict the future trend in the urban environment. In the field of water resources and hydrology, Artificial Intelligence system approaches such as fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), etc. have been used successfully for nonlinear and non-stationary time series modeling. For complex system, both FL and ANN techniques are combined together so as the individual strength can be exploited in a better manner for the construction of powerful hybrid system.

The influence of lagged variables with respect to daily water consumption and their combination are analyzed. The performances of the ANFIS models are evaluated by using three performance indices namely CC, MSE and MRE and best model was selected. The best ANFIS model reveals higher correlation with recorded data when compared to single fuzzy logic model and statistical Multi-Linear Regression model (MLR).

How to determine frailty in cardiac patients, particularly TAVR candidates, has been difficult to objectively quantify. The purpose of this research was to statistically measure which outcome tool most accurately depicted frailty in patients who underwent TAVR. Our study was performed based on the comparison between two approaches: the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), which is the current national assessment standard conducted, and the Fried scale, which tests five frailty domains: gait speed, grip strength, low physical activity, exhaustion, and weight loss. Each domain of the Fried scale was explored and compared alongside the KCCQ with that frail/not frail to the TAVR patients with complications and deaths. Low physical activity was the strongest single-frailty domain predictor. Three statistical models – Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were used to build classification systems to predict complication conditions. Comparing static numbers, such as Sensitivity, Specificity and Area under Curve (AUC), it is believed that composed models based on the five domains of the Fried scale were able to demonstrate more accurate results than the traditional KCCQ approach. Both SVM and ANN showed significant performance, but further research is necessary to confirm specificity for the Fried scale with the TAVR population.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-48335-1_19,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although since early ’90 of the past century NN have been widely employed to evaluate firms performance, to the best of our knowledge the use of SOM of that specific task is much less documented. Moreover, the main novelty of the paper relies on the attention to data at “microscopic” level: data processing in an infra-city perspective, in fact, has been neglected till now, although recent studies demonstrate that inequalities in economic and well-being conditions of people are higher among neighbourhoods of the same city rather than among different cities or regions.

Journey prices can change dynamically in almost real time and also vary geographically from one area to another in a city, a strategy known as surge pricing. In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open datasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies that emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more transparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price comparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover that Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher fares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in occurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone application, OpenStreetCab , that offers a personalized consultation to mobile users on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months after its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a single city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the potential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a highlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per taxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive experiments to show how Uber’s surge pricing is the driving factor of higher journey prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application’s users. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber’s surge pricing is occurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction task where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area’s tendency to surge. Using exogenous to Uber data, in particular Yellow Cab and Foursquare data, we show how it is possible to estimate customer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high accuracy.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0060-2,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the full exploitation of such capabilities in the application domains requires that two main conditions are satisfied: availability of the data and use of automatic and reliable procedures for data processing. Moreover, to make the methodology largely used, it is important to set up low-cost processing chains that can be afforded by different user communities. This paper presents the first results of a study aiming at the design of new and low-cost procedures for soil sealing monitoring in the city of Rome, Italy. The procedure relies on the use of the software “Neumapper,” based on neural network algorithms, and “Landsat” multispectral satellite data. Both the software and the data are freely distributed, so their combined exploitation represents an interesting method for systematically obtaining thematic maps on an issue of great environmental importance. The obtained results show a classification accuracy of 78.46 %. Overall, we found that 29.36 % of the study area, of about 939 km^2, was occupied by a sealed surface.

Cardholders’ behavioral characteristics in using public transport are modeled with seven neural network model equations, one for each day of the week, and stored in an RFID card. At the time of use, these model equations or characteristics are employed to predict whether the user is the real owner of the card. Therefore, even if the RFID card is cloned, the cloned card cannot be used because a passenger’s behavioral characteristics when using public transport are individual and unique, such as the passenger’s signature or style of speech.

Recent work has demonstrated how regularly monitoring these online maps allows for a granular analysis of a city’s cycling trends; further, the literature indicates that different cities have unique spatio-temporal patterns, reducing the generalisability of any insights or models derived from a single system. In this work, we analyse 4.5 months of online bike-sharing map data from ten cities which, combined, have 996 stations. While an aggregate comparison supports the view of cities having unique usage patterns, results of applying unsupervised learning to the temporal data shows that, instead, only the larger systems display heterogeneous behaviour, indicating that many of these systems share intrinsic similarities. We further show how these similarities are reflected in the predictability of stations’ occupancy data via a cross-city comparison of the error that a variety of approaches achieve when forecasting the number of bicycles that a station will have in the near future.

These are a potential source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second, we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11116-015-9598-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Two distinct model runs were performed as follows: data processing using hourly-recorded time series of airborne pollutants during cold months (O_3, NO_2, and PM_10), when residential heating increases the local emissions, and data processing using 24-h daily averaged concentrations (PM_2.5) recorded between 2009 and 2012. Dataset variability was assessed using statistical analysis. Time series were passed through various FANNs. Each time series was decomposed in four time-scale components using three-level wavelets, which have been passed also through FANN, and recomposed into a single time series. The agreement between observed and modelled output was evaluated based on the statistical significance ( r coefficient and correlation between errors and data). Daubechies db3 wavelet–Rprop FANN (6-4-1) utilization gave positive results for O_3 time series optimizing the exclusive use of the FANN for hourly-recorded time series. NO_2 was difficult to model due to time series specificity, but wavelet integration improved FANN performances. Daubechies db3 wavelet did not improve the FANN outputs for PM_10 time series. Both models (FANN/WFANN) overestimated PM_2.5 forecasted values in the last quarter of time series. A potential improvement of the forecasted values could be the integration of a smoothing algorithm to adjust the PM_2.5 model outputs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10661-015-4697-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this article, we propose a context-aware mobility management (MM) procedure for small cell networks, which uses reinforcement learning techniques and inter-cell coordination for improving the handover and throughput performance of UE. In particular, the BSs jointly learn their long-term traffic loads and optimal cell range expansion and schedule their UE based on their velocities and historical data rates that are exchanged among the tiers. The proposed approach is shown not only to outperform the classical MM in terms of throughput but also to enable better fairness.

Their effects on models with varying ranges of time-series inputs and different prediction horizons are studied in detail. It is found that including stock market indices and other most relevant local factors has generally improved the prediction performance of the neural network models in all cases. Additional reduction in the prediction error is achieved by the proposed ensemble model trained with different time lags. Yet, the degree of improvement depends on the look-ahead horizon for prediction.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-014-1438-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The challenge for such studies is to combine the health effects, caused by injuries, with the disease driven health effects, and to express the change in the health with a common health indicator. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) combines years lived disabled or injured (YLD) and years of life lost (YLL) providing practical indicator to combine injuries with diseases. In this study, we estimate the average YLDs for one person injured in a transport crash to allow easy to use methods to predict health effects of transport injuries. Methods We calculated YLDs and YLLs for transport fatalities and injuries based on the data from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA). In STRADA, all the fatalities and most of the injuries in Sweden for 2007–2011 were recorded. The type of injury was recorded with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes. In this study these AIS codes were aggregated to injury types, and YLDs were calculated for each victim by multiplying the type of injury with the disability weight and the average duration of that injury. YLLs were calculated by multiplying the age of the victim with life expectancy of that age and gender. YLDs and YLLs were estimated separately for different gender, mode of transport and location of the crash. Results The average YLDs for injured person was 14.7 for lifelong injuries and 0.012 for temporal injuries. The average YLDs per injured person for lifelong injuries for pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were 9.4, 12.8 and 18.4, YLDs, respectively. Lifelong injuries sustained in rural areas were on average 31% more serious than injuries in urban areas. Conclusions The results show that shifting modes of transport will not only change the likelihood of injuries but also the severity of injuries sustained, if injured. The results of this study can be used to predict DALY changes in HIA studies that take into account mode shifts between different transport modes, and in other studies predicting the health effects of traffic injuries.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-765,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recently, it was shown that it is possible to approximate the solution of the TIE using a low-pass monogenic signal framework. The purpose of this paper is to show that using the local phase of the aforementioned monogenic signal instead of the defocused image improves the cell/background classification accuracy. Materials and methods    The paper statement was tested on an image database composed of three cell lines: adherent CHO, adherent L929, and Sf21 in suspension. Local phase and local energy images were generated using the low-pass monogenic signal framework with axial derivative images as input. Machine learning was then employed to investigate the discriminative power of the local phase.

In addition, ET_o is vital for calculating the agricultural demand. In fact, Penman-Monteith (PM) method is considered as reference method for estimating (ET_o), however, this method required a lot of data to be used which is not usually available in many catchment areas. Furthermore, there are several efforts that have been performed as competitor to reach accurate estimation of (ET_o) when there is lack of data to utilize (PM) method, but still required numerous research. Recently, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been suggested to provide reliable prediction model for several application in engineering and especially for hydrological process. However, time series prediction based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally difficult and faces problem. One of the major shortcomings is that the ANN model experiences over-fitting problem during training session and also occurs when a neural network loses its generalization.

Simulation models provide a means of accurately representing the complex physiochemical, socioeconomic, and legal-administrative behavior of complex water resources systems, but lack the capability of systematically determining optimal water planning and management decisions. Optimization models, on the other hand, excel at automatic determination of optima, while often sacrificing the accurate representation of the underlying water system behavior. Various means of effectively establishing a synergy between simulation and optimization models that accentuates their advantages while minimizing their shortcomings have evolved from the field of artificial intelligence within the province of computer science. Artificial intelligence was defined by John McCarthy in 1955 as “the science and engineering of making intelligent decisions.” Machine learning, as a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of specific algorithms that allow computerized agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with a real or simulated environment. Although there are many aspects of machine learning, the focus here is on agent-based modeling tools for learning optimal decisions and management rule structures for water resources systems under conflicting goals and complex stochastic environments. A wide variety of machine learning tools such as reinforcement learning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy rule-based systems, and evolutionary algorithms are applied herein to complex decision problems in integrated management of multipurpose river-reservoir systems, real-time control of combined sewer systems for pollution reduction, and integrated design and operation of stormwater control systems for sustaining and remediating coastal aquatic ecosystems damaged by intensified urbanization and development.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-62703-595-8_10,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Suburban areas of Belgrade have been of particular interest because they are sprawling rapidly and without regulations, so the city needs a regulation plan in these areas. Landslide susceptibility mapping, which has been demonstrated in this work, provides one of the criteria (relative stability of the terrain) for developing such a plan. The analyses of susceptibility involved a state-of-the-art technique based on a machine learning algorithm. The procedure required input data in the form of thematic raster datasets, represented by various geological, geomorphological, and environmental features of the area, as well as a valid landslide inventory for training the algorithm. The resulting map depicts zones of relative (high–low) susceptibility and correlates well with the existing inventory.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-05050-8_73,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, the task of understanding, modelling and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of air pollution in urban zones is an interesting and challenging topic having many research axes from science-based modelling to geostatistics and data mining. Recently, the application of land use regression models (LUR) for air pollution analysis and mapping in urban zones has demonstrated their efficiency.

To test the hypothesis, labelled sets of planes from 3D point clouds gathered during the RoboCup Rescue Robot competition are used as positive and negative examples for an ILP system.

This context introduces the importance of quantifying the impacts resulting from land artificialization increase, the assessment of coastal erosion and the development of strategies for achieving an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). In this study we employed the Land Transformation Model (LTM) to forecast urban growth to year 2014 in the South Coast of São Miguel Island, Azores (Portugal). Two different scenarios for modeling urban growth were tested: (1) one that considered an urban sprawl trend equivalent to the one measured between years 1998 and 2005, and (2) another that considered the restrictions included in the intervention area of South Coast Management Plan (POOC Costa Sul). The objective was to evaluate the impact of the POOC Costa Sul in the urban growth of the studied area. Results show that the POOC Costa Sul is not effective in containing urban growth quantities which are equivalent to the non-restricted scenario. However, it was possible to observe that it is effective in deciding where the urban expansion is likely to happen, preventing, for instances, the occurrence of urban growth near water lines or in the maritime public domain.

Due to a growing human-footprint and associated anthropogenic food subsidies, raven populations have increased dramatically over the past several years throughout the USA. The sub-arctic region has also witnessed increased urbanization and industrialization, and ravens have taken advantage of these changes. During 2004 and 2006, we surveyed parking lots on a bi-weekly basis in the city of Fairbanks in interior Alaska, showing an influx of ravens in winter. Between 2010 and 2012, we documented the presence and absence of ravens at a permanent set of 30 suspected raven locations and 21 randomized locations within the city limits of Fairbanks. We used machine learning (RandomForests) and 12 spatial GIS datasets from the Fairbanks North Star Borough to accurately model-predict the relative occurrence of ravens during winter and summer in Fairbanks. Our research showed a positive correlation between raven occurrence and commercial and residential zones in both winter and summer, as well as an inverse geographic relationship between ravens and the waste transfer station in the study area in winter, and a direct correlation near restaurants in summer.

Artificial intelligence–based methods may provide reliable prediction models for several applications in engineering. However, time-series prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) learning algorithms is fundamentally problematic. For example, the ANN model can experience over-fitting during training and, in consequence, lose its generalization. In this research, several over-fitting procedures have been augmented with the classical ANN model, are proposed. This model was applied to the prediction of the daily ET_o at Rasht city, located in the north part of Iran, by using the minimum and maximum daily temperature of the region collected from 1975–1988. In addition, three different scenarios have been developed in order to achieve better prediction accuracy. The results showed that the proposed ENN model successfully predicted the daily ET_o with a significant level of accuracy using only the maximum and minimum temperatures. The model also outperformed the classical ANN method. In addition, the proposed ENN compared with Hargreaves and Samani (Appl Eng Agric 1:96–99, 1985) (HGS) model and showed the ENN provides more accurate prediction for ET_o.

The present study explores the development and application of ANN models for forecasting, 24 h ahead, not only the daily concentration levels of PM_10 but also the number of hours exceeding the PM_10 concentration threshold during the day in five different regions within the greater Athens area (GAA).

The evaluation of the model performance showed the risk of daily PM_10 concentration levels exceeding certain thresholds as well as the duration of the exceedances can be successfully predicted. Despite the limitations of the model, the results indicate that ANNs, when adequately trained, have considerable potential to be used for 1 day ahead PM_10 concentration forecasting and the duration within the GAA.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11270-013-1634-x,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, improvement of prediction performance, proper selection of input parameters and model architecture, and quantification of model uncertainties remain key challenges to their practical use. This study has three main objectives: to select an ensemble of input parameters for ANN metamodels consisting of meteorological variables that are predictable by conventional weather forecast models and variables that properly describe the complex nature of pollutant source conditions in a major city, to optimize the ANN models to achieve the most accurate hourly prediction for a case study (city of Tehran), and to examine a methodology to analyze uncertainties based on ANN and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). In the current study, the ANNs were constructed to predict criteria pollutants of nitrogen oxides (NO_x), nitrogen dioxide (NO_2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), ozone (O_3), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM_10) in Tehran based on the data collected at a monitoring station in the densely populated central area of the city. The best combination of input variables was comprehensively investigated taking into account the predictability of meteorological input variables and the study of model performance, correlation coefficients, and spectral analysis. Among numerous meteorological variables, wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity and wind direction were chosen as input variables for the ANN models. The complex nature of pollutant source conditions was reflected through the use of hour of the day and month of the year as input variables and the development of different models for each day of the week. After that, ANN models were constructed and validated, and a methodology of computing prediction intervals (PI) and probability of exceeding air quality thresholds was developed by combining ANNs and MCSs based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The results showed that proper ANN models can be used as reliable metamodels for the prediction of hourly air pollutants in urban environments. High correlations were obtained with R ^2 of more than 0.82 between modeled and observed hourly pollutant levels for CO, NO_x, NO_2, NO, and PM_10. However, predicted O_3 levels were less accurate. The combined use of ANNs and MCSs seems very promising in analyzing air pollution prediction uncertainties. Replacing deterministic predictions with probabilistic PIs can enhance the reliability of ANN models and provide a means of quantifying prediction uncertainties.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11356-012-1451-6,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The environment, in which the company exists is also important. This is the reason why the optimization in a company should be made having in mind those aspects. The modification and optimization process in a company should include changes in its environment. The question is how long it takes for the company to adapt. Changes can be not significant in certain moment, but with the time they can have large influence on the company. It is not easy to recognize the size of the impact while consequences can be serious for the company. If the changes are recognized quickly, the company can conquer the difficulties by adaptation or can make changes in their processes. Sometimes the situation is not so simple, for example when the changes are detected too late or they require changes in management system. Improvement of the system can take a lot of time, i.e., year or more. This time would be shorter, if the system would change from itself, then the improvement of the system could be not so tedious and so consumptive of time. This is possible by implementation of elements of artificial intelligence in the system. Therefore the authors suggest a new concept of transport management, with use of an intelligent hybrid system, which adjusts to the current economic situation without updating or changing the management system and thanks to it the company can quickly replay with no outlay. The hybrid system consists of a neural network and three expert systems. It will influence the transport time by optimization of loading processes. In this manner the time and money will be spared. The loading surface and the number of trucks needed to transport the goods will be also optimized by continuous adaptation to the current economic situation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00557-7_60,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we describe a method for urban change detection by fusing high resolution aerial images with airborne lidar data which provides elevation information. For dealing with radiometric differences, three supervised learning algorithms are introduced which reduce the need for radiometric corrections. Three experiments are conducted on different training sets for each algorithm, to evaluate their performance on change detection and their sensitivity to unbalanced and noisy datasets. All algorithms are also compared with the standard PCA method. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of these methods and a detailed theoretical analysis of the achieved results is also presented.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-45025-9_51,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Case Study: City of Syracuse, Italy",Water Resources Management,10.1007/s11269-012-0089-y,Springer,2012-09-01,"Forecasting urban water demand can be of use in the management of water utilities. For example, activities such as water-budgeting, operation and maintenance of pumps, wells, reservoirs, and mains require quantitative estimations of water resources at specified future dates. In this study, we tackle the problem of forecasting urban water demand by means of back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANNs) coupled with wavelet-denoising. In addition, non-coupled ANN and Linear Multiple Regression were used as comparison models. We considered the case of the municipality of Syracuse, Italy; for this purpose, we used a 7 year-long time series of water demand without additional predictors. Six forecasting horizons were considered, from 1 to 6 months ahead. The main objective was to implement a forecasting model that may be readily used for municipal water budgeting. An additional objective was to explore the impact of wavelet-denoising on ANN generalization. For this purpose, we measured the impact of five different wavelet filter-banks (namely, Haar and Daubechies of type db2, db3, db4, and db5 ) on a single neural network. Empirical results show that neural networks coupled with Haar and Daubechies’ filter-banks of type db2 and db3 outperformed all of the following: non-coupled ANN, Multiple Linear Regression and ANN models coupled with Daubechies filters of type db4 and db5 . The results of this study suggest that reduced variance in the training-set (by means of denoising) may improve forecasting accuracy; on the other hand, an oversimplification of the input-matrix may deteriorate forecasting accuracy and induce network instability.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11269-012-0089-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Right now, hundreds of universities, corporations, and governments are spending billions researching and developing intelligent robotic systems for use in automation, military, medicine, electronics, food and beverage, service and a host of other industries. There is no doubt that robotic systems will play a major role in shaping the future of the world and as research and industry merge, progress in robotics technology will advance several times beyond the current level. This progress will be driven by a need to not only make life easier for consumers, but also to improve communities and even nations as a whole. The market for wireless robots and robotic systems far exceeds the current utilization and as technology advances, the use of robots will be incorporated primarily or indirectly in almost all fields. Of course the most interesting application is use of mobile and communicative robotic systems in everyday life. The possibilities are limited only by human creativity and intellect—the driving force that can turn this industry into the forerunner for an autonomous robot assisted future. Two of the most important areas for furthering the wide scale adaption of robotics are “autonomous mobility” and “wireless communications”. The field of endeavor by which robotic systems communicate wirelessly is known as Wireless Robotics. Advances in the field of Wireless Robotics are necessary to further the growth of robotic systems and their use in everyday life. Research and development in this field needs to progress more rapidly in order to see faster adoption of robots in everyday life. One way to stimulate this growth is by leveraging expertise on a global scale. But for people to cooperate in a global environment and be able to design systems without running into compatibility issues, standards are necessary.

These methods are implemented using a hierarchical, layered control scheme developed for the Yeti robot, a 73-kg, four-wheeled robot designed to perform autonomous medium-range missions in polar terrain. The methodology is motivated by the difficultly of visually recognizing terrain features that impact mobility in low contrast terrain. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated using data from a suite of proprioceptive sensors. Real-time implementation shows that Yeti can consistently detect pre-immobilization conditions, stop in time to avoid unrecoverable immobilization, identify the terrain feature presenting the mobility challenge, and execute an escape sequence to retreat from the condition.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10514-011-9224-5,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Article,doi:10.1186/2049-6958-6-1-28,Effects of climatic changes and urban air pollution on the rising trends of respiratory allergy and asthma,Multidisciplinary Respiratory Medicine,10.1186/2049-6958-6-1-28,BioMed Central,2011-02-28,"Over the past two decades there has been increasing interest in studies regarding effects on human health of climate changes and urban air pollution. Climate change induced by anthropogenic warming of the earth's atmosphere is a daunting problem and there are several observations about the role of urbanization, with its high levels of vehicle emissions and other pollutants, and westernized lifestyle with respect to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases observed in most industrialized countries. There is also evidence that asthmatic subjects are at increased risk of developing exacerbations of bronchial obstruction with exposure to gaseous (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide) and particulate inhalable components of air pollution. A change in the genetic predisposition is an unlikely cause of the increasing frequency in allergic diseases because genetic changes in a population require several generations. Consequently, environmental factors such as climate change and indoor and outdoor air pollution may contribute to explain the increasing frequency of respiratory allergy and asthma. Since concentrations of airborne allergens and air pollutants are frequently increased contemporaneously, an enhanced IgE-mediated response to aeroallergens and enhanced airway inflammation could account for the increasing frequency of allergic respiratory diseases and bronchial asthma. Scientific societies such as the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, European Respiratory Society and the World Allergy Organization have set up committees and task forces to produce documents to focalize attention on this topic, calling for prevention measures. Nelle ultime due decadi si è registrato un crescente interesse sugli effetti delle modificazioni climatiche e dell’inquinamento urbano sulla salute dell’uomo. Le modificazioni climatiche indotte dal riscaldamento globale dell’atmosfera terrestre su base antropica rappresentano un problema pressante e si sono moltiplicate le osservazioni sul ruolo dell’urbanizzazione, con i suoi elevati livelli di emissioni di veicoli e di altri inquinanti, e dello stile di vita occidentale sulla sempre maggior frequenza di malattie respiratorie su base allergica nei paesi a più elevato tasso di industrializzazione. Vi è inoltre evidenza che gli asmatici sono a maggior rischio di sviluppo di riacutizzazioni dell’ostruzione bronchiale con l’esposizione alle componenti dell’inquinamento atmosferico di tipo gassoso (ozono, biossido di azoto, biossido di zolfo) e particolato. È improbabile che possa essere chiamata in causa una modificazione della predisposizione genetica per giustificare l’aumentata incidenza di malattie allergiche, perché lemodificazioni genetiche richiedono diverse generazioni per esprimersi. Sono quindi i fattori ambientali come le modificazioni climatiche, l’inquinamento dell’ambiente esterno e domestico a potere spiegare almeno in parte la maggiore frequenza di malattie respiratorie su base allergica e di asma. Poiché le concentrazioni di allergeni inalati e di inquinamento atmosferico vanno spesso di pari passo, una maggior rispostaIgE-mediata agli aeroallergeni ed una maggior flogosi delle vie aeree può dar conto della maggior frequenza di forme allergiche respiratorie e di asma bronchiale.

The experimental results showed that Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training algorithm proved to be successful in training the recurrent neural network for the stormwater runoff prediction.

Besides irrigation, they provide refuges for wintering birds. The issue at hand is that these features are disappearing, and this brings with it the loss of this refuge function. It is ecologically significant because one-fifth of all the bird species in Taiwan find a home on these ponds. This study aims at characterizing the diversity of bird species associated with these ponds, whose likelihood of survival was assessed along the gradient of land development intensities. Such characterization helps establish the decision criteria needed for designating certain ponds for habitat preservation and developing their protection strategies. A holistic model was developed by incorporating logistic regression with error back-propagation into the paradigm of artificial neural networks (ANN). The model considers pond shape, size, neighboring farmlands, and developed areas when calculating parameters pertaining to their respective and interactive influences on avian diversity, among them the Shannon–Wiener diversity index ( H ′). Results indicate that ponds with a regular shape or ones of larger size possess a strong positive correlation with H ′. Farm ponds adjacent to farmland benefited the diversity of waterside birds. On the other hand, urban development was shown to cause a reduction of farmland and pond numbers, which in turn reduced the diversity of waterside birds. By running the ANN model with four neurons, the resulting H ′ index shows a good-fit prediction of bird diversity against pond size, shape, neighboring farmlands, and neighboring developed areas with a correlation coefficient ( r ) of 0.72, in contrast to the results from a linear regression model ( r  <  0.28).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-4-431-87799-8_13,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The location of the license plate is not same for all types of vehicles and in some developing countries the size of the license plate also varies. The localization of such a license plate requires a series of complex image processing steps in which edge detection plays major role, as the edges give crucial information regarding the location. In order to localize the license plate in real time, the amount of data to be processed must be minimized at the stage where the edges are identified. In this work we proposed Cellular Neural Network based edge detection for real time computation of edges.

IMMS combines the features of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and mass spectrometry (MS). It separates and detects peptide ions on a millisecond time-scale. IMS separates peptide ions based on drift time that is determined by the collision cross-section of each peptide ion in a given experiment condition. A peptide ion's collision cross-section is related to the ion size and shape resulted from the peptide amino acid sequence and their modifications. This inherent relation between the drift time of peptide ion and peptide sequence indicates that the drift time of peptide ions can be used to infer peptide sequence and therefore, for peptide identification. Results This paper describes an artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression model for the prediction of peptide ion drift time in IMMS. Each peptide in this work was represented using three descriptors (i.e., molecular weight, sequence length and a two-dimensional sequence index). An ANN predictor consisting of four input nodes, three hidden nodes and one output node was constructed for peptide ion drift time prediction. For the model training and testing, a 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed for three datasets each containing different charge states. Dataset one contains 212 singly-charged peptide ions, dataset two has 306 doubly-charged peptide ions, and dataset three has 77 triply-charged peptide ions. Our proposed method achieved 94.4%, 93.6% and 74.2% prediction accuracy for singly-, doubly- and triply-charged peptide ions, respectively. Conclusions An ANN-based method has been developed for predicting the drift time of peptide ions in IMMS. The results achieved here demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the prediction model. This work can enhance the confidence of protein identification by combining with current database search approaches for protein identification.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1471-2105-11-182,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Dynamic urban expansion models are useful tools to understand the urbanization process, project its spatiotemporal dynamics and provide useful information for assessing the environmental implications of urbanization. A hybrid urban expansion model (NNSCA model) was proposed to simulate rapid urban growth in a typical industrial city, Dongying, China, by coupling a artificial-neural-network-based stochastic cellular automata model and several socioeconomic indictors, i.e., the per capita income of the rural population, the per capita income of the urban population, population and gross domestic products of the city. Good conformity between simulated and actual urban patterns suggested that the NNSCA model was able to effectively simulate historic urban growth and to generate realistic urban patterns. A series of scenario analyses suggested that the expanding urban would threaten the ecosystem health of coastal wetlands in the city unless environmental protection actions are taken in the future.

A bi-layer dielectric was utilized consisting of thin nitrided SiO_2 covered by 25nm of Al_2O_3 deposited using atomic layer deposition. Field-effect mobility and threshold voltage (V_T) were found to vary with SiC nitric oxide (NO) anneal temperature. High peak mobility values of 106 cm^2/V·s were obtained, with a corresponding V_T of 0.8 V, using an 1175°C 20 min NO anneal of the SiC before Al_2O_3deposition. Constant voltage stressing (CVS) of the gate (3 MV/cm) for 1000s induces a V_T increase of only 0.12 V for the devices stressed at RT, whereas a V_T.shift of 0.34 V occurs for devices stressed at 150°C.

In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies.

Chemometric evaluation allowed identification of moderately (median 173−187 ng g^−1, range 54–375 ng g^−1 in soil and 130 ng g^−1, range 47–310 ng g^−1 in sediment) and heavily polluted samples (662 ng g^−1, range 426–884 ng g^−1). Heavily polluted were located mainly below and in the area of the Poznań city. Statistical comparison of mercury species distribution in floodplain soils of the Warta River shows different patterns for moderately and heavily polluted samples. In heavily polluted soils the contribution of mobile mercury (sum of organomercury species, water- and acid soluble species) is lower (4.2%) than in moderately polluted soils (6.1%). Higher contribution of mobile mercury was observed in sediments of the Warta River (12%). In case of moderately polluted samples, statistical differences in the contribution of mercury species are relatively low and thus the environmental risk from mercury deposited in aquatic system of the Warta River is relatively low.

The result indicates that time grouping of 2–10  pm is dominantly affected by inversion conditions and peak traffic flow. The ANNCOP model corresponding to this grouping predicts the 8-h average CO concentrations within the accuracy range of 68–71%. The CO persistence values derived from ANNCOP model are comparable with the persistence values as suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA. This work demonstrates that ANN based model is capable of describing winter period CO persistence phenomena.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10661-007-9831-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They are achieved through careful analytical studies of the characteristics of landslide prone areas, thus, providing useful information regarding possible future phenomena. Such maps represent a fundamental step in the drawing up of adequate measures of landslide hazard mitigation. However, for a complete estimation of landslide hazard, meant as the degree of probability that a landslide occurs in a given area, within a given space of time, detailed and uniformly distributed data regarding their incidence and causes are required. This information, while obtainable through laborious historical research, is usually partial, incomplete and uneven, and hence, unsatisfactory for zoning on a regional scale. In order to carry this out effectively, the utilization of spatial estimation of the relative levels of landslide hazard in the various areas was considered opportune. These areas were classified according to their levels of proneness to landslide activity without taking recurrence periods into account. Various techniques were developed in order to obtain upheaval numerical estimates. The method used in this study, which was applied in the area of Potenza, is based on techniques derived from artificial intelligence (Artificial Neural Network—ANN). This method requires the definition of appropriate thematic layers, which parameterize the area under study. These are recognized by means of specific analyses in a functional relationship to the event itself. The parameters adopted are: slope gradient, slope aspect, topographical index, topographical shape, elevation, land use and lithology.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11069-007-9169-3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we have analyzed the characteristic features of amino acid residues in membrane proteins that perform major functions, such as channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and primary active transporters. Results We observed that the residues Asp, Asn and Tyr are dominant in channels/pores whereas the composition of hydrophobic residues, Phe, Gly, Ile, Leu and Val is high in electrochemical potential-driven transporters. The composition of all the amino acids in primary active transporters lies in between other two classes of proteins. We have utilized different machine learning algorithms, such as, Bayes rule, Logistic function, Neural network, Support vector machine, Decision tree etc. for discriminating these classes of proteins. We observed that most of the algorithms have discriminated them with similar accuracy. The neural network method discriminated the channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and active transporters with the 5-fold cross validation accuracy of 64% in a data set of 1718 membrane proteins. The application of amino acid occurrence improved the overall accuracy to 68%. In addition, we have discriminated transporters from other α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins with the accuracy of 85% using k-nearest neighbor method. The classification of transporters and all other proteins (globular and membrane) showed the accuracy of 82%. Conclusion The performance of discrimination with amino acid occurrence is better than that with amino acid composition. We suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate transporters from all other globular and membrane proteins, and classify them into channels/pores, electrochemical and active transporters.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-135,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In comparison to results of measurements above homogeneous ecosystem sites, the CO_2 fluxes above the urban investigation area showed more peaks and higher variances during the course of a day, probably caused by traffic and other varying, anthropogenic sources. The main goal of this study is the introduction and establishment of a new gap filling procedure using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, which is also applicable under complex environmental conditions. We applied adapted RBF neural networks within a combined modular expert system of neural networks as an innovative approach to fill data gaps in micrometeorological flux time series. We found that RBF networks are superior to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks in the reproduction of the highly variable turbulent fluxes. In addition, we enhanced the methodology in the field of quality assessment for eddy covariance data. An RBF neural network mapping system was used to identify conditions of a turbulence regime that allows reliable quantification of turbulent fluxes through finding an acceptable minimum of the friction velocity. For the data analysed in this study, the minimum acceptable friction velocity was found to be 0.15  m s^−1. The obtained CO_2 fluxes, measured on a tower at 65 m a.g.l., reached average values of 12 μmol m^−2 s^−1 and fell to nighttime minimum values of 3 μmol m ^−2 s^−1. Mean daily CO_2 emissions of 21 g CO_2 m^−2d ^−1 were obtained during our 6-week experiment. Hence, the city centre of Münster appeared to be a significant source of CO_2. The half-hourly average values of water vapour fluxes ranged between 0.062 and 0.989 mmol m^−2 s^−1and showed lower variances than the simultaneously measured fluxes of CO_2.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s10546-007-9249-7,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By means of a questionnaire based on the MSLQ of Pintrich and De Groot (1990) the students reported their use of learning and resource management strategies, and their motivational values and attitudes. Two tests measured vocabulary and mathematical reasoning. Background characteristics, grades, track position and school composition (i.e., proportions of immigrant students) were registered as well. A factor analysis yielded two learning patterns: self-regulated deep learning and self-regulated surface learning. Subsequent analyses of variance showed that, compared to boys, girls prefer SR surface learning. However, immigrant girls fit best in the SR deep learning pattem. The contrast between immigrant and non-immigrant girls is substantial. Explanations for this particular group difference, and for variance in SR deep learning in general, were explored. Of the achievement measures, only average grade explains variance in SR deep learning. Motivational values and resource management strategies do so as well. Track position does not, but school composition does affect the way immigrant students learn. Schools with more than 60% immigrant students enhance more SR deep learning than schools with less than 20% immigrant students. As the difference in SR deep learning between immigrant and non-immigrant girls is not explained by any of the covariates, we suggest alternative explanations in the discussion section. Pour déterminer et comprendre d’éventuelles différences en apprentissage autonome profond entre des élèves performants de milieux d’immigrés et de non immigrés, nous avons examiné 650 élèves en seconde de lycées généraux à Amsterdam, dont 39% viennent de milieux d’immigrés. Le questionnaire MSLQ de Pintrich et de Groot (1990) a permis aux élèves de rapporter sur leur usage de cinq stratégies d’apprentissage, de stratégies d’organiser des ressources, et sur leur motivation (valeurs et attitudes). Deux tests ont mesuré leur vocabulaire et leur aptitude mathématique. Nous avons demandé aux élèves d’indiquer leurs notes récentes, leur lieu de naissance, la scolarité de leurs parents, et leur sexe. D’une analyse factorielle des cinq stratégies d’apprentissage deux facteurs ont surgis: l’apprentissage autonome profond et l’apprentissage autonome superficiel. Les analyses de variance succédantes ont montré que, comparées aux garçons, les filles ont une préférence pour l’apprentissage autonome superficiel. Pourtant, de tous les élèves, les filles de milieu d’immigrés tendent les plus fortes à l’apprentissage autonome profond. Dans ce respect, le contraste entre les filles de milieu d’immigrés et les filles de milieu non immigrés est substantiel. Afin d’éclaircir cette différence prononcée et de comprendre la variation en apprentissage autonome profond dans la population entière d’élèves nous avons examinés le rôle de plusieurs covariantes. Parmi les indicateurs du niveau de performances, seulement les notes paraissent importantes pour l’apprentissage autonome profond. Les valeurs et attitudes motivationnelles, ainsi que les stratégies d’organiser des ressources, le sont également. La filière ne joue aucun rôle, mais la composition scolaire du lycée parait faire une différence. Les lycées recevant 60% ou plus d’élèves de milieu d’immigrés stimulent davantage l’apprentissage autonome profond que les lycées à 20% ou moins d’élèves d’immigrés. Comme la différence en apprentissage autonome profond entre les filles de milieu d’immigrés et les filles de milieu de non immigrés n’a pas été expliquée par les covariantes proposées, nous entamons une explication alternative dans la section finale.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF03173139,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Though most current traffic lights use simple heuristic protocols, more efficient controllers can be discovered automatically via multiagent reinforcement learning, where each agent controls a single traffic light. However, in previous work on this approach, agents select only locally optimal actions without coordinating their behavior. This paper extends this approach to include explicit coordination between neighboring traffic lights. Coordination is achieved using the max-plus algorithm, which estimates the optimal joint action by sending locally optimized messages among connected agents. This paper presents the first application of max-plus to a large-scale problem and thus verifies its efficacy in realistic settings. It also provides empirical evidence that max-plus performs well on cyclic graphs, though it has been proven to converge only for tree-structured graphs. Furthermore, it provides a new understanding of the properties a traffic network must have for such coordination to be beneficial and shows that max-plus outperforms previous methods on networks that possess those properties.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-87479-9_61,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Among the several ITS applications is the notion of Dynamic Traffic Routing (DTR), which involves generating “optimal” routing recommendations to drivers with the aim of maximizing network utilizing. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a self-learning intelligent agent to solve the DTR problem to achieve traffic user equilibrium in a transportation network. The core idea is to deploy an agent to a simulation model of a highway. The agent then learns by itself by interacting with the simulation model. Once the agent reaches a satisfactory level of performance, it can then be deployed to the real-world, where it would continue to learn how to refine its control policies over time. To test this concept in this paper, the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) developed by Carlos Daganzo of the University of California at Berkeley is used to simulate a simple highway with two main alternative routes. With the model developed, a Reinforcement Learning Agent (RLA) is developed to learn how to best dynamically route traffic, so as to maximize the utilization of existing capacity. Preliminary results obtained from our experiments are promising. RL, being an adaptive online learning technique, appears to have a great potential for controlling a stochastic dynamic systems such as a transportation system. Furthermore, the approach is highly scalable and applicable to a variety of networks and roadways.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-85081-6_62,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The municipality of Aksaray city plays a key role in developing solutions to surface water management and protection in the central Anatolian part of Turkey. The responsibility to provide drinking water and sewage works, regulate the use of private land and protect public health provides the mandate and authority to take action. The present approach discusses the main sources of contamination and the result of direct wastewater discharges into the Melendiz and Karasu rivers, which recharge the Mamasın dam sites by the use of artificial neural network (ANN) modeling techniques. The present study illustrates the ability to predict and/or approve the output values of previously measured water quality parameters of the recharge and discharge areas at the Mamasin dam site by means of ANN techniques. Using the ANN model is appreciated in such environmental research. Here, the ANN is used for estimating if the field parameters are agreeable to the results of this model or not. The present study simulates a situation in the past by means of ANN. But in case any field measurements of some relative parameters at the outlet point “discharge area” have been missed, it could be possible to predict the approximate output values from the detailed periodical water quality parameters. Because of the high variance and the inherent non-linear relationship of the water quality parameters in time series, it is difficult to produce a reliable model with conventional modeling approaches. In this paper, the ANN modeling technique is used to establish a model for evaluating the change in electrical conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values in recharge (input) and discharge (output) areas of the dam water under pollution risks. A general ANN modeling scheme is also recommended for the water parameters. The modeling process includes four main stages: (1) source data analysis, (2) system priming, (3) system fine-tuning and (4) model evaluation. Results of the ANN modeling scheme indicate that the output values are agreeable to the water quality parameters, which were measured at the field in the static water mass of the Mamasın dam lake. Water contamination at the dam site is caused by the continuous increase of nutrient contents and decrease of the O_2 level in water causing an anaerobic condition. It may stimulate algae growth flow in such water bodies, consequently reducing water quality.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00254-007-0705-y,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As such, it is important to assess the enhancement of PM_10 during yellow sand periods. In order to estimate PM_10 enhancement, we adopted factor analysis to distinguish the yellow-sand (YS) periods from non-yellow-sand (NYS) periods based on air quality monitoring records. Eight YS events were identified using factor analysis coupling with an independent validation procedure by checking background site values, examining meteorological conditions, and modeling air mass trajectory from January 2001 to May 2001. The duration of each event varied from 11 to 132 h, which was identified from the time when the PM_10 level was high, and the CO and NO_ x levels were low. Subsequently, we used the artificial neural network (ANN) to simulate local PM_10 levels from related parameters including local gas pollutants and meteorological factors during the NYS periods. The PM_10 enhancement during the YS periods is then calculated by subtracting the simulated PM_10 from the observed PM_10 levels. Based on our calculations, the PM_10 enhancement in the maximum hour of each event ranged from 51 to 82%. Moreover, in the eight events identified in 2001, it was estimated that a total amount of 7,210 tons of PM_10 were transported by yellow sand to Taipei. Thus, in this study, we demonstrate that an integration of factor analysis with ANN model could provide a very useful method in identifying YS periods and in determining PM_10 enhancement caused by yellow sand.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10661-006-9534-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The purpose of this study was to determine the possibility of using artificial neural networks for identification of any patterns occurring during heating and nonheating seasons. The samples included in the study were collected over a period of 5 years (1997–2001) in the area of the city of Gdansk and the levels of pollutants measured in the samples collected were used as inputs to two different types of neural networks: multilayer perceptron (MLP) and self-organizing map (SOM). The MLP was used as a tool to predict in what heating season a certain sample was collected, and the SOM was applied for mapping all samples to recognize any similarities between them.

It was found that the coexistence of different ferromagnetic phases at low temperatures is sensitive to electric current/field. In a contrast with the previously studied low resistivity metastable states the high resistivity state exhibits positive magnetoresistance and significant current dependence of the resistivity even at temperatures much higher than the Curie temperature. Application of current pulses results in appearance of zero bias anomaly in the current dependent conductivity. Similarly to the low resistivity metastable states the memory of the resistivity can be erased only after heating of the sample to T_e ≈360 K. After one year storage at room temperature the La_0.8Ca_0.2MnO_3 samples show clear signatures of aging. The aged samples spontaneously evolute towards high resistivity states. The results are discussed in the context of a coexistence of two ferromagnetic phases with different orbital order and different conductivity.

However, in contrast to the availability of a large number of successful application demonstrations, it is hard to find studies in the literature that provide systematic examinations of the state-of-the-art, the application domains, and the applicability of artificial neural networks to transportation problems. On the other hand, some unseen artificial neural network development has been motivated by transportation engineering objectives. Therefore, this study presents the development of a neural network paradigm for the purpose of daily trip flow forecasting. In this study, the prediction problem was transformed into the following minimum norm problem: Find a back - propagation neural network such that ‖ P ( U _k)− NN ( U _k)‖_2 is minimal. P ( U _k) represents the observed values and NN ( U _k) represents the neural network generated values. The averages of half-hourly public transport (PT) trip flows using AKBIL (a ticketing system integrated to all PT modes) in Istanbul Metropolitan Area are used as data. As the objective of the study was the forecast of the half-hourly mean trip flows (trips) by using ANN, the analysis process consisted of two steps, which are training and testing respectively. The feed forward back-propagation (FFBP) method was used to train the ANNs. Determination of the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in the input layer providing the best training results was the initial process of the training procedure. The mean square error (MSE) and the auto-correlation function (ACF) were used as criteria to evaluate the performance of the training simulations. Three hidden layer nodes were found appropriate for the four-nodded input layer. More than three nodes for the hidden layer could not improve the MSE during the testing stage. Following the ANN forecast, a comparison was made by means of a stochastic model. An auto-regressive model of order four was used. The results were then compared. Among the studied models, a significant improvement in the prediction made by the neural network model is noticed, due to its flexibility to adapt to time-series database. Making forecasts by generating negative values after trials is a disadvantage of the algorithm used to train the neural network. It can be said that various kinds of learning algorithms should be assessed during the training process to overcome this drawback.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-32400-3_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These methods are used to numerically solve the light energy transport equation (the rendering equation). Stochastic methods are used because the integration is performed in a high-dimensional space, and the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo methods is independent of the dimension. Nevertheless, modern studies are focused on quasi-random samples that depend on the dimension of the integration space and make it possible to achieve, under certain conditions, a high rate of convergence, which is necessary for interactive applications. In this paper, an approach to the development of an algorithm for the bidirectional ray tracing is suggested that reduces the overheads of the quasi-Monte Carlo integration caused by the high effective dimension and discontinuity of the integrand in the rendering equation.

CA models can be regarded as a planning tool because they can generate alternative urban growth. Alternative development patterns can be formed by using different sets of parameter values in CA simulation. A critical issue is how to define parameter values for realistic and idealized simulation. This paper demonstrates that neural netowrks can simplify CA models but generate more plausible results. The simulation is based on a simple three-layer network with an output neuron to generate conversion probability. No transition rules are required for the simulation. Parameter values are automatically obtained from the training of network by using satellite remote sensing data. Original training data can be assessed and modified according to planning objectives. Alternative urban patterns can be easily formulated by using the modified training data sets rather than changing the model.,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF02826669,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the most sought-after information in any ITS project is to provide arterial travel speed forecasts to travellers. To estimate the arterial travel speed, one needs to apply a mathematical model supplied with sensor data generated by roadside sensors and in-vehicle sensors. In this research effort, we develop a simple Bayesian estimator and an expanded neural network model to estimate arterial link travel speed. Input data used are from dual-loop detectors and probe vehicles with DSRC(Dedicated Short-range Communication) device. Data from one of model city, Jeonju, are used to generate test data for the simulation where the probe vehicle’s speed is random sampled from observed vehicles’ speed. Initial run shows that the neural network model developed can provide accurate estimates of arterial link speed using only probe vehicle’s speed data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-24707-4_114,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The issue was partly addressed by models of land use and transportation which were mainly developed in the UK and US in the 1970s and 1980s, but the major advances were made in the area of modelling transportation, while very little was achieved in the area of spatial and temporal land use. Models of land use and transportation are well-established tools, based on explicit, exogenouslyformulated rules within a theoretical framework. The new approaches of artificial intelligence, and in particular, systems involving parallel processing, (Neural Networks, Cellular Automata and Multi-Agent Systems) defined by the expression “Neurocomputing”, allow problems to be approached in the reverse, bottom-up, direction by discovering rules, relationships and scenarios from a database. In this article we examine the hypothesis that territorial micro-transformations occur according to a local logic, i.e. according to use, accessibility, the presence of services and conditions of centrality, periphericity or isolation of each territorial “cell” relative to its surroundings. The prediction capabilities of different architectures of supervised Neural networks are implemented to the south Metropolitan area of Milan at two different temporal thresholds and discussed. Starting from data on land use in 1980 and 1994 and by subdividing the area into square cells on an orthogonal grid, the model produces a spatial and functional map of urbanisation in 2008. An implementation of the SOM (Self Organizing Map) processing to the Data Base allows the typologies of transformation to be identified, i.e. the classes of area which are transformed in the same way and which give rise to territorial morphologies; this is an interesting by-product of the approach.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/1-4020-2409-6_3,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Airborne pollution is a serious, and willbe a major problem in Hong Kong within the next few years. InHong Kong, Respirable Suspended Particulate (RSP) and NitrogenOxides NO_x and NO_2 are major air pollutants due to thedominant diesel fuel usage by public transportation and heavyvehicles. Hence, the investigation and prediction of the influence and the tendency of these pollutants are ofsignificance to public and the city image. The multi-layerperceptron (MLP) neural network is regarded as a reliable andcost-effective method to achieve such tasks. The works presentedhere involve developing an improved neural network model, whichcombines the principal component analysis (PCA) technique and theradial basis function (RBF) network, and forecasting thepollutant levels and tendencies based in the recorded data. Inthe study, the PCA is firstly used to reduce and orthogonalizethe original input variables (data), these treated variables arethen used as new input vectors in RBF neural network modelestablished for forecasting the pollutant tendencies. Comparingwith the general neural network models, the proposed modelpossesses simpler network architecture, faster training speed,and more satisfactory predicting performance. This improvedmodel is evaluated by using hourly time series of RSP, NO_x and NO_2 concentrations collected at Mong Kok Roadside Gaseous Monitory Station in Hong Kong during the year 2000. By comparing the predicted RSP, NO_x and NO_2 concentrationswith the actual data of these pollutants recorded at the monitorystation, the effectiveness of the proposed model has been proven.Therefore, in authors' opinion, the model presented in the paper is a potential tool in forecasting air quality parameters and hasadvantages over the traditional neural network methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1024819309108,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In water resources management of a complex system of rivers, it is important that instream discharges and sediments being carried by streamflow are correctly predicted. In this study, a model for predicting flow and sediment transport in a river system is developed by incorporating flow and sediment mass conservation equations into an artificial neural network (ANN), using actual river network to design the ANN architecture, and expanding hydrological applications of the ANN modeling technique to sediment yield predictions. The ANN river system model is applied to modeling daily discharges and annual sediment discharges in the Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake, China. By the comparison of calculated and observed data, it is demonstrated that the ANN technique is a powerful tool for real-time prediction of flow and sediment transport in a complex network of rivers. A significant advantage of applying the ANN technique to model flow and sediment phenomena is the minimum data requirements for topographical and morphometric information without significant loss of model accuracy. The methodology and results presented show that it is possible to integrate fundamental physical principles into a data-driven modeling technique and to use a natural system for ANN construction. This approach may increase model performance and interpretability while at the same time making the model more understandable to the engineering community.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00267-002-2862-9,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The kernel of this technique is to use the characteristic features (RMS, Peak value, Power spectral density) of tension signals which allow the identification of the faulty rollers and the diagnosis of the degree of fault in the rollers. The characteristic features could be used to train an artificial neural network which could classify roller conditions into three groups (normal, warning, and faulty conditions).

These 30 s estimates would provide the traffic network operator with immediate post-event congestion information on roads where no close circuit television cameras were present. The mechanistic approach estimated journey times every 30 s between pairs of detectors, using the knowledge of vehicle speed derived from the loops and the distances between them. The 30 s average loop-occupancy time per vehicle, average time-gap between vehicles and percentage occupancy parameters derived from the inductive loops were presented to a neural network for training along with the associated vehicles' measured journey times.

One reason for this development is the level of maturity of both theory of AI concepts and its implementation into application tools for commercial use. Another very important reason is the persistent drive of many industries to increase efficiencies and the realisation that this requires more effective processing of gained knowledge and information. In the oil and gas industry, due to high saturation levels of many production fields and the complex nature of processes, the need for increased efficiencies and highly effective processing of a large amount of information is particularly evident. Some organisations have recognised the opportunities offered by AI-based techniques and started exploiting them in order to improve knowledge and information handling and process efficiencies. This paper discusses the application of two AI-based techniques, fuzzy logic (FL) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to specific problems related to the operation of oil and gas transport facilities. The background for the work, which is carried out in a co-operation between a university and a leading engineering service provider, is described firstly. This is followed by a brief summary of the fundamentals of the AI techniques considered with respect to their use for industrial purposes. then, two case studies are presented. The first case study demonstrates the application of fuzzy logic to the control of a pump station in a pipieline system whilst the second case study shows the use of an ANN for the determination of important pipeline characteristic.

This system takes advantage of scene changes in the video trace on a scale larger than a second, and it adapts the bandwidth as needed. An improvement on efficiency is achieved by assigning bandwidth for the transport of VBR video and having more than one predictor in parallel with different prediction horizons, hence this scheme reduces the processing time for the bandwidth adaptation with no significant degradations on the queue statistics. The link capacity required for a specific session is a function of the input traffic, which is characterized by its spectral characteristic. In particular, we use the low frequency band of the power spectrum, which is extracted from the stochastic input by a low pass filter.

It is found that neural networks with no hidden layers exhibit almost identical performance to logit models in all three cases. For the synthetic data which breaches the underlying logit assumptions and with real data, backpropagation neural networks with a hidden layer can achieve a better fit than logit.

The performance of neural network analysis needs to be carefully judged, however, since the theoretical underpinning of neuro-computing is still weakly enveloped. In the present paper we will use the logit model as a benchmark for evaluating the result of neural network models, based on an empirical case study from Italy. The present paper aims to assess the foreseeable impact of the high-speed train in Italy, by investigating competition effects between rail and road transport modes. Two statistical models will then be compared, viz. the traditional logit model and a new technique for information processing, viz. the feedforward neural network model. In the study two different cases – corresponding to a different set of attributes – are investigated, namely by using only ‘time’ attributes and by using both ‘time’ and ‘cost’ attributes. From an economic viewpoint, both models appear to highlight the advantage of introducing the high-speed train system in that they show high probabilities of choosing the improved rail transport mode. The feedforward neural net model seems to provide reasonable predictions compared to those obtained by means of a logit model. An important lesson however, is that it is important to define properly the neural network architecture and to train sufficiently the network during the learning phase.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s001680050056,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The SEEK-FIND(SEEK For Initialisation of Neural Descriptor) algorithm is efficient to estimate state variables in multi-modal nonlinear systems with slowly varying states. When a nonlinear system has regularities, i.e. slowly varying states, and irregularities, i.e. quickly varying states such as bifurcations, the recurrent neural network is applied to estimate the regular states instead of the SEEK filter after trained by using one-step delayed estimates and the current estimates from the SEEK filter as the input signals and the teacher signals, respectively. The SEEK filter is activated again when the system shows irregularities such as bifurcations. The SEEK filter and the neural network are automatically switched by monitoring the maximum estimation error. As a demonstration here, we offer the dual-states Lorenz system with long regular states and the three vortices flow system with bifurcations after taking long term regularities. The latter is simulated by the discrete vortex method as a simple example of multi-modal transport processes in high Reynolds number flows. It has been confirmed that the state variables are accurately estimated by smoothly switching the SEEK filter to the trained neural network, and vice versa.

Recent studies suggest that factors influencing levels and metabolism of HDL include both the composition and size of HDL and the fractional catabolic rates of apoAl or apoAll (Brinton et al., 1991). Factors modulating HDL composition and size include lipid transfer proteins (cholesteryl ester transfer protein {CETP} and phospholipid transfer protein {PLTP}) as well as enzymes, such as lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase {LCAT} and lipases, hepatic triglyceride lipase {HTGL} and lipoprotein lipase {LPL}. Like mature HDL in human plasma, HDL precursors (designated as nascent HDL or nHDL) are also potentially subject to the above modulating agents. However, except for LCAT little is known what effect these factors may have on the structural and metabolic properties of the precursor particles or how such remodeling may influence the channeling of precursors towards specific HDL subpopulations in human plasma. LCAT-mediated transformation of apoAl-containing discoidal analogs of precursor nHDL to HDL-like products is characterized by a strong positive correlation between the size of the precursor particles and the size of their core-containing transformation products (Figure 1) (Nichols, 1990). Thus, modulation-induced change in size of nHDL particles by transfer proteins or enzymes would be expected to correspondingly shift the size of their LCAT-transformation products. In view of the association between HDL level and HDL particle size and composition, reduction in nHDL size may contribute to lower HDL levels and increased risk of CHD. Since nHDL lack core lipids and consist almost exclusively of phospholipid, unesterified cholesterol and apolipoproteins, their remodeling mainly involves phospholipid depletion as facilitated by CETP and PLTP and phospholipid lipolysis as facilitated by HTGL.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-84634-2_4,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

",Zeitschrift für Physik B Condensed Matter,10.1007/BF01312140,Springer,1988-06-01,"We report measurements of resistivity ρ( T ), magnetoresistivity Δρ( B, T ), and Hall effect R _ H ( T ) between 50 mK and 300 K of CeCu_2Si_2 and CeCu_6 thin films, prepared by sputtering. Lattice disorder was introduced by low temperature irradiation using 25 MeV^16O-ions as projectiles; impurity effects were studied by substituting Ce by La in CeCu_6. Before irradiation the Heavy Fermion films showed at low temperature a strong reduction of ρ( T ) as well as of R _ H ( T ) upon cooling indicating the formation of a coherent state of the Heavy Fermions. Δρ( B, T ) exhibits a minimum below which a drastic increase is observed, which leads in case of CeCu_2Si_2 to a change of sign, reflecting the screening of the magnetic moments due to Kondo effect. Besides the degradation of superconductivity, deviations from the ideal stoichiometric lattice periodicity cause, even if only a few percent of the atoms are displaced or substituted, a complete suppression of the features connected with coherence effects. Introducing further disorder (i.e. if ≈20% of all atoms are displaced) the transport properties exhibit a continuation of the high temperature behavior to lowest temperature. This could indicate that disturbed Heavy Fermion systems can be considered as lattices of independent Kondo scatterers.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01312140,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In systems — such as aircraft, air traffic control and manned space stations — where the human ability to back-up all control functions should be retained, it is important to design the man-machine system in a way to allow operation on different levels of automation (from manual to autonomous). This keeps the human “in the loop” and enables him to “take over” immediately in the case of emergency or system failure. An interesting aspect of the system lay-out is that it allows different locations of the meta-controller. This is the intelligence above the man-machine system, which decides on the goals, on the authority distribution between the man and the machine and has the most complete knowledge of the world in which the man-machine system operates. The meta-control can be assigned to a human or a computer, it can be collocated with the machine or remote (e. g. the ground station in space experiments).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BFb0006956,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, we derive a new type of integral equation for the density operator using a time-dependent projection operator and disentangling the stochastic, not the deterministic part of the motion in contrast to previous treatments. The mean square displacement is then expressed by the kernel of this equation in the case of diagonal fluctuations. We obtain an equation of motion for this kernel similar in structure to equations known from Green's function theory and containing a self-energy like quantity.

The transport model used is that of an overdamped particle in a sinusoidal pinning potential. In spite of overdamping the proposed current noise produces a threshold hysteresis in the CVC.

The study presented here was designed to investigate how aluminum exerts its effects on the neuronal cytoskeleton. Microinjections of AlCl_3 were administered directly to the rabbit lumbar spinal cord; the injections resulted in the accumulation of neurofilament bundles in upwards of 80% of the anterior horn cells. Approximately 7 d later, [^35S]methionine was administered to the same region, and exactly 14 d after the radioactive pulse the animals were sacrificed. Sequential 3-mm segments of the sciatic nerves beginning at the root exit zone were processed for gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The counts incorporated into gel bands representing actin, tubulin, and the neurofilament (NF) subunits were determined for each segment, and a distribution curve for the pooled control and pooled aluminum-treated rabbits was constructed. The distribution curves for the two groups, separately analyzed for each cytoskeletal protein, did not significantly differ using an analysis of variance. We conclude that an interruption of slow axonal transport does not occur in this model of aluminum-induced lumbar myelopathy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF02834283,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As a model substance a simple cubic crystal is taken where each Jahn-Teller molecule has an octahedral surrounding. The T electronic ground state is linearly coupled to e and t type vibrations with the e coupling dominating. By a unitary transformation the electron-phonon system is approximately decoupled. The remaining cooperative electron-electron system displays transport properties which are discussed in terms of a modified Maradudin formalism. Thermal conductivity is calculated by linear response theory. It is shown that in the transformed picture the phonon heat current approximately is independent from the pseudo spin heat current and the total thermal conductivity is given as a simple superposition of both contributions.,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01320214,springer,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
