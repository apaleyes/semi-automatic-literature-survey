A steadily increasing trend of obesity is not only limited to developed countries, but to developing nations as well. As smartphones have rapidly gained mainstream popularity, mobile applications (apps) are used in public health as intervention to keep track of diets, activity as well as weight, which is deemed more accurate than relying on user's self-report measure, for the sake of weight management. A solution called “Smart Wireless Interactive Healthcare System” (SWITCHes) is developed to facilitate objective data reception and transmission in a real-time manner. Based on the user data acquired from SWITCHes app and the auxiliary data from medical instruments, not only SWITCHes app can engage user with tailored feedback in an interactive way, in terms of artificial intelligence-powered health chatbot, but the healthcare professional can provide the more accurate medical advice to user also. This paper presents an overview of development and implementation of SWITCHes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8607399/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM),16-19 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ISMCR47492.2019.8955729,A Novel Architecture for Condition Based Machinery Health Monitoring on Marine Vessels Using Deep Learning and Edge Computing,IEEE,Conferences,"Condition based machinery health monitoring on marine vessels involves collecting operational sensor data on the vessel using a robust data acquisition system and determining asset health using anomaly detection analytics. Automation and digitalization of marine vessels involve smart digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect ships' health data and send it over to a central processing location where this data is analyzed. However, it is difficult to apply this to the shipping industry due to offshore data transmission bandwidth challenges. Deep Learning, a technology that can be used to conduct Machinery Health Monitoring (MHM) holds the key to solve the bandwidth problems. In this paper, we investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a practical solution for deploying Smart Health Monitoring on Marine Vessels using the example of electric induction motors. We show a mechanism to develop data-driven deep learning model that can classify if the motor is in a healthy or faulty condition, and propose an architecture to deploy this model on the Marine vessel in real time on an edge computing hardware.

IoT-based health systems help to improve the quality of healthcare services through real-time data acquisition and processing. However, traditional IoT architectures have some limitations.

Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, including long-range communication protocols such as LoRa, are a potential candidate to overcome the lacking network infrastructure. Nevertheless, LPWANs have limited transmission bandwidth not suitable for high data rate applications such as fall detection systems or electrocardiography monitoring.

Most of the traditional redundant algorithms require all redundant components to work at the same time to vote. It requires a lot of resources, and it is impossible to know the specific health status of the working module. In order to solve this problem, we propose a redundant fault tolerant system based on neural network health assessment. In this model, one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder is trained to assess the health state of the module. According to the health score, it can judge whether the working module is faulty and whether it needs to switch to the redundant module.

Hence, building resilient CPSs is a prime need and continuous monitoring of the CPS operational health is essential for improving resilience. This paper presents a framework for calculating and monitoring of health in CPSs using data driven techniques. The main advantages of this data driven methodology is that the ability of leveraging heterogeneous data streams that are available from the CPSs and the ability of performing the monitoring with minimal a priori domain knowledge. The main objective of the framework is to warn the operators of any degradation in cyber, physical or overall health of the CPS. The framework consists of four components: 1) Data acquisition and feature extraction, 2) state identification and real time state estimation, 3) cyber-physical health calculation and 4) operator warning generation. Further, this paper presents an initial implementation of the first three phases of the framework on a CPS testbed involving a Microgrid simulation and a cyber-network which connects the grid with its controller.

When working on monitoring solutions, it is crucial to take into account different operating variables, such as rotational speed, especially in real world experiences. This work addresses the topic of predictive maintenance by exploiting the fusion of sensor data and the artificial intelligence-based analysis of signals measured by sensors. With a set of data such as vibration and sound reflection from the sensors, we focus on finding solutions for the task of detecting the health condition of machines.

However, discovering knowledge from the big medical data can be very complex because of the nature of this type of data: they normally contain large amount of unstructured data; they may have lots of missing values; they can be highly complex and heterogeneous. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Collaborative Filtering-Enhanced Deep Learning approach. In particular, we estimate missing values based on patients' similarity, i.e., we predict one patient's missing features based on the values of similar patients. This is implemented with the Collaborative Topic Regression method, which tightly couples topic model and probability matrix factorization and is able to utilize the rich information hidden in the data. Then a deep neural network-based method is applied for the prediction of health risks. This method can help us handle complex and multi-modality data.

10.1109/AERO.2005.1559665,Health monitoring: new techniques based on vibrations measurements and identification algorithms,IEEE,Conferences,"Purpose of the paper is to present an innovative application inside the nondestructive testing field based on vibrations measurements, developed, at the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" (Italy), by the authors during the last three years, and already tested for analysing damages of many structural elements. The aim has been the development of a nondestructive test (NDT) which meet to most of the mandatory requirements for effective health monitoring systems, simultaneously reducing as much as possible the complexity of the data analysis algorithm and of the experimental acquisition instrumentation; these peculiarities may, in fact, not be neglected for an operative implementation of such a system. The proposed new method is based on the acquisition and comparison of frequency response functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an occurred damage. Structural damages modify the dynamical behaviour of the structure such as mass, stiffened and damping, and consequently the FRFs of the damaged structure in comparison with the FRFs of the sound structure, making possible to identify, to localize and quantify a structural damage. The activities, presented in the paper, mostly focused on a new FRFs processing technique based on the determining of a representative ""damage index"" for identifying and analysing damages both on real scale aeronautical structural components, like large-scale fuselage reinforced panels, and on aeronautical composite panels. Besides it has been carried out a dedicated neural network algorithm aiming at obtaining a ""recognition-based learning""; this kind of learning methodology permits to train the neural network in order to let it recognise only ""positive"" examples discarding as a consequence the ""negative"" ones. Within the structural NDT a ""positive"" example means ""healthy"" state of the analysed structural component and, obviously, a ""negative"" one means a ""damaged"" or perturbed state. With this object in view the neural network has been trained making use of the same FRFs of the healthy structure used for the determining of the damage index, as positive examples. From an architectural point of view magnetostrictive devices have been tested as actuators, and piezoceramic patches as actuators and sensors. Besides it has been used a laser-scanning vibrometer system to validate the behaviour of the piezoceramic patches and define their technical parameters in order to lay the bases for design a light and reliability system. These techniques promise to bring a step forward for the implementation of an automatic ""health monitoring"" system which will be able to identify a structural damage in real time, improving the safety and reducing maintenance costs",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1559665/,2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference,5-12 March 2005,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2010.8851,Improving activity classification for health applications on mobile devices using active and semi-supervised learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Mobile phones' increasing ubiquity has created many opportunities for personal context sensing. Personal activity is an important part of a user's context, and automatically recognizing it is vital for health and fitness monitoring applications. Recording a stream of activity data enables monitoring patients with chronic conditions affecting ambulation and motion, as well as those undergoing rehabilitation treatments. Modern mobile phones are powerful enough to perform activity classification in real time, but they typically use a static classifier that is trained in advance or require the user to manually add training data after the application is on his/her device. This paper investigates ways of automatically augmenting activity classifiers after they are deployed in an application. It compares active learning and three different semi-supervised learning methods, self-learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning, to determine which show promise for this purpose. The results show that active learning, En-Co-Training, and democratic co-learning perform well when the initial classifier's accuracy is low (75-80%). When the initial accuracy is already high (90%), these methods are no longer effective, but they do not hurt the accuracy either. Overall, active learning gave the highest improvement, but democratic co-learning was almost as good and does not require user interaction. Thus, democratic co-learning would be the best choice for most applications, since it would significantly increase the accuracy for initial classifiers that performed poorly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5482296/,2010 4th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,22-25 March 2010,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment.

There are many challenges in mining EHRs, such as temporality, irregularity, sparsity, bias, etc. Thus effective feature extraction and representation are key steps before any further applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-task deep representation learning method (MTDRL) with the objective of extracting the valuable clinical information from raw data and learning an effective and interpretable patient representation. Firstly, MTDRL utilizes Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) as an encoder to learn the hidden state vectors which are used as inputs for the following networks. This encoding part can be seen as a shared network for all tasks. Secondly, patient's in-hospital mortality prediction and sequence reconstruction are simultaneously conducted based on the encoding network. Specifically, an attention mechanism and a fully-connected layer are incorporated in prediction task and BiGRU is implemented in the other task to reconstruct the visit sequences. Finally, we apply MTDRL to real EHRs data and the experimental results demonstrate that MTDRL is capable of learning more effective patient representation and has a significant improvement in the performance of patient's in-hospital mortality prediction.

Power distribution involves delivering electric power from multiple generation sources to a dynamic set of load devices. Advanced power electronics, intelligent controllers, and a communications infrastructure form a shipboard power distribution network, much like the domestic electric utility power grid. Multiple electric generation and storage devices distributed throughout the ship will eliminate dependence on any single power source through dynamic load management and power grid connectivity. Although new technologies are under development, gas turbine and diesel generators remain as the likely near-term power sources for the future all-electric ship integrated power system (IPS). Health monitoring of these critical IPS power sources are essential to achieving reliability and survivability goals. System complexity, timing constraints, and manning constraints will shift both control and equipment health monitoring functions from human operators to intelligent machines. Drastic manning reductions coupled with a large increase in the number of sensor monitoring points makes automated condition-based maintenance (CBM) a stringent requirement. CBM has traditionally been labor intensive and expensive to implement, relying on human experiential knowledge, interactive data processing, information management, and cognitive processing. The diagnostic robustness and accuracy of these embedded software agents are essential, as false or missed diagnostic calls have severe ramifications within the intelligent, automated control environment. This paper presents some of the first reported results of intelligent diagnostic software agents operating in real-time onboard naval ships with gas turbine and diesel machinery plants.

Although many studies addressed this challenge, most of them use the same dataset for training and testing. There is no cross-check with other datasets or implementation in real-time to check performance on new data. This is problematic, as evidenced in this paper, because the classifiers overtrain on dataset-specific features. This limits realtime, real-world usage.

The common particularity of all these application domains is that a great part of this data is mostly unlabeled. Thus, designing a learning model with a minimum of labeled data represents a major challenge in the coming years. A particular emphasis has recently been put on unsupervised learning methods based on the idea of autoencoding. The objective of these methods is twofold: to reduce the dimensionality of the input space and to reconstruct the original observation from this lower dimensional representation space. The variational form of these autoencoders, called the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), is particularly successful in almost all application areas. This enthusiasm comes from the fact that VAEs allow to take advantage of the theoretical foundations of the Variational Bayesian methods and the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks. This review paper gives to the PHM community a synthesis of the latest publications in the PHM domain using the VAEs related to four topics: 1) Data-Driven Soft Sensors for missing values and data outliers, 2) reconstruction error for fault detection, 3) resampling approach for imbalanced data generation and minority class and 4) the variational embedding as PHM preprocessing pipelines and data transformations.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy.

Deep learning models, especially the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are powerful tools. However, at this stage, it is often difficult to explain the semantics of the features and evolution laws learned by RNNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a survival prediction model based on graph pattern mining. First, each patient's health insurance data are built as a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN). Then, frequent patterns are mined from these HINs and each frequent pattern is regarded as a feature, called “pattern feature”. At last, the predictive survival time is given by an improved random forest, which is able to take into account the censored data. We conducted experiments on a real health insurance data set. The experimental results show that the model has better predictive ability than the traditional survival prediction models.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8983290/,2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),18-21 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Clinical data are the basic staple that feeds intelligent healthcare applications, but due to its sensitive character, its sharing and usage by third parties require compliance with both confidentiality agreements and security measures. Data Anonymization emerges as a solution to both increasing the data privacy and reducing the risk against unintentional disclosure of sensitive information through data modifications. Although the anonymization improves privacy, the diverse modifications also harm the data functional suitability. These data modifications can affect applications that employ the anonymized data, especially those that are data-centric such as the AI tools. To obtain a trade-off between both qualities (privacy and functional suitability), we use the Test-Driven Anonymization (TDA) approach, which anonymizes incrementally the data to train the AI tools and validates with the real data until maximizing its quality. The approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset from the Spanish Institute for the Study of the Biology of Human Reproduction (INEBIR). The anonymized datasets are used to train AI tools and select the dataset that gets the best trade-off between privacy and functional quality requirements.

Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility. Results from the network are explainable, enabling human oversight of operational decisions. Real-time implementation enables integration into avionics systems.

In a WBAN, the patient's smartphone is deemed an appropriate sink to help forward the sensing data to back-end servers. Through a real-world case study, we observe that temporary disconnection between sensors and the associated smartphone can happen frequently due to postural changes, causing a significant amount of data to be lost forever. In this paper, we propose a scheme to parasitize the data in surrounding Wi-Fi networks whenever temporary disconnection occurs. Specifically, we model data parasitizing as an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the system lifetime without any data loss. Then, we propose an optimal offline algorithm to solve the problem, as well as an online algorithm that allows practical implementations. We have also implemented a prototype system, where the online algorithm serves as the underlying technique, based on Arduino. To evaluate our scheme, we conduct a series of experiments with the prototype system in controlled and real-world environments.

The problem is characterized by the unknown risk probability distribution across the population and two contradictory objectives: minimizing the number of tests and giving the medical test to all at-risk populations. This article sets this problem in a general framework of chance-constrained medical test rationing with unknown subject distribution over an attribute space and unknown risk probability but with a given sample population. A new approach combining decision-tree and Bayesian inference is proposed to allocate relevant medical tests according to the subjects&#x2019; profile. Case studies on screening of hypertension and diabetes are conducted, and the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated. Significant savings on unnecessary tests are achieved with limited numbers of subjects needing but not receiving necessary tests. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;Whether a medical test is needed for all subjects in health prevention? Is it possible to reduce unnecessary tests without jeopardizing the goal of screening at-risk populations? This article attempts to answer these questions by proposing a data-driven approach combining decision trees for subject profiling, Bayesian inference for unknown probability distribution estimation, and combinatorial optimization for test allocation. The application of this approach to a real-case study reduces the number of electrocardiogram (ECG) tests by 90&#x0025; while keeping the number of hypertensive subjects needing but not receiving ECG tests small (five out of 230). A significant cut of unnecessary tests is also achieved in a second case study of diabetes screening. This approach allows decision-makers to better balance the cost-saving and the level of public health objective. Furthermore, the combination with decision trees makes the practical implementation quite straightforward.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9406177/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,July 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Pakistan has its GDP based on agriculture, however it relies on manual monitoring of crops, which is a labour intensive and ineffective method. In contrast to this, several cutting edge technology-based solutions are being employed in the developed countries to enhance the crop yield with the optimal use of resources. To this end, we have proposed an integrated approach for monitoring crop health using IoT, machine learning and drone technology. The integration of these sensing modalities generate heterogeneous data which not only varies in nature (i.e. observed parameter) but also has different temporal fidelity. The spatial resolution of these methods is also different, hence, the optimal integration of these sensing modalities and their implementation in practice are addressed in the proposed system. In our proposed solution, the IoT sensors provide the real-time status of environmental parameters impacting the crop, and the drone platform provide the multispectral data used for generating Vegetation Indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) for analyzing the crop health. The NDVI provides information about the crop based on the chlorophyll content, which offers limited information regarding the crop health. In order to obtain a rich and detailed knowledge about crop health, the variable length time series data of IoT sensors and multispectral images were converted to a fixed-sized representation to generate crop health maps. A number of machine and deep learning algorithms were applied on the collected data wherein deep neural network with two hidden layers was found to be the most optimal model among all the selected models, providing an accuracy of (98.4%). Further, the health maps were validated through ground surveys and by agriculture experts due to the absence of reference data.

This article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart manufacturing.

Therefore, it is an important task to predict the disease onset information (referred to as medical codes in this paper) within the upcoming visit based on patients' EHR data. In order to achieve this objective, the real-time nature and high dimensionality of EHR data must be addressed. Moreover, the prediction results of the model must be interpretable. Existing methods mainly use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model EHR data and adopt attention mechanism to provide interpretability. However, diagnosis and treatment information have usually been regarded as the same kind of information, the difference and relationship between the two parts being ignored. This has led to unclear analysis about the patient's disease development and inaccurate prediction results. To address this limitation, we propose a CrossOver Attention Model (COAM). This model adopts two RNNs to process diagnosis and treatment information, respectively, and then deploys a crossover attention mechanism to improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the correlation between the two parts of information. It can learn effective representations of personal medical diagnosis and treatment, and provide interpretable prediction results.

Diabetic eye disease is the primary cause of blindness between working aged peoples. The major populated Asian countries such as India and China presently account for millions of people and at the verge of an eruption of diabetic inhabitants.

One of the complexities of solving such problems is that often one or more objectives are usually conflicting under given conditions. In this study, the benefits of relying on a deployed Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) concerning the overall reputation of a health facility has been studied. The analysis is performed in terms of a co-operative Bayesian game-theoretic model. The game is played between two players of which the first player is a patient who needs quick and accurate medical attention and the second player is the hospital administration that relies on medical experts as well as integrated multi-objective clinical data classification systems for decision-making. The proposed model “MEAF” - Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm using Fuzzy Genetics attempts to address accuracy and interpretability simultaneously using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). This model enables a HCDSS to detect a disease accurately by using the available resources efficiently.

Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs. However, there is a shortage of visible work that focus on early-stage risk prediction of these diseases. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based health CPS framework that addresses the challenge of effectively processing the wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diabetes as an example of NCDs. In the experiment, a verified diabetic dataset has been used for training, while the testing has been performed on an artificially generated data collection from sensors.

Most of these studies have focused on predicting failures of hard drives, i.e., labeling the status of a hard drive as “good” or not. However, in real-world storage systems, hard drives often deteriorate gradually rather than suddenly. Correspondingly, their SMART attributes change continuously towards failure. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel method based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to assess the health statuses of hard drives based on the gradually changing sequential SMART attributes. Compared to a simple failure prediction method, a health status assessment is more valuable in practice because it enables technicians to schedule the recovery of different hard drives according to the level of urgency. Experiments on real-world datasets for disks of different brands and scales demonstrate that our proposed method can not only achieve a reasonable accurate health status assessment, but also achieve better failure prediction performance than previous work.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7426410/,IEEE Transactions on Computers,1 Nov. 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This revolution delivers a promising solution for the health monitoring problem of the heat pump (HP) system, a vital device widely deployed in modern buildings for heating use, to timely evaluate its operation status to avoid unexpected downtime. Many HPs were practically manufactured and installed many years ago, resulting in fewer sensors available due to technology limitations and cost control at that time. It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. In this article, we propose a hybrid scheme by integrating industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and intelligent health monitoring algorithms to handle this challenge. To start with, an IIoT network is constructed to sense and store measurements. Specifically, temperature sensors are properly chosen and deployed at the inlet and outlet of the water tank to measure water temperature.

Characterized by frequent operation switches of different HPs due to the variable demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating speeds are observed. Slowness, a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed of steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern division and health evaluation.

The proposed quality-aware ECG monitoring system consists of three modules: 1) ECG signal sensing module; 2) automated signal quality assessment (SQA) module; and 3) signal-quality aware (SQAw) ECG analysis and transmission module. The main objectives of this paper are: design and development of a light-weight ECG SQA method for automatically classifying the acquired ECG signal into acceptable or unacceptable class and real-time implementation of proposed IoT-enabled ECG monitoring framework using ECG sensors, Arduino, Android phone, Bluetooth, and cloud server. The proposed framework is tested and validated using the ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Physionet challenge databases and the real-time recorded ECG signals under different physical activities. Experimental results show that the proposed SQA method achieves promising results in identifying the unacceptable quality of ECG signals and outperforms existing methods based on the morphological and RR interval features and machine learning approaches. This paper further shows that the transmission of acceptable quality of ECG signals can significantly improve the battery lifetime of IoT-enabled devices.

Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the industrial revolution that mainly focuses on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) of components in the industrial process is one of the crucial and important component of Industry 4.0. SHM of components exposed to high-temperature ( $\sim 650^{\circ }\text{C}$ ) is becoming increasingly important nowadays. However, harsh and high temperature environments impose a great challenge towards their implementation. This review is an attempt to demonstrate the development, application, limitations and recent advancement of the existing sensors used for SHM. Some sensors such as eddy current (EC) sensors and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have been discussed in detail. A phenomenological study of the electromagnetic sensor for the SHM of engineering components that are exposed to high temperature has been addressed. State-of-the-art fabrication methodologies such as low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology for such type of sensors for high temperature SHM applications have been elucidated.

In conjunction with researchers from civil engineering and computer science, this article studied a fundamental problem motivated from practical IoT-based BSHM: how to effectively prolong network lifetime while guaranteeing desired coverage. Integrating a promising reinforcement learning model named learning automata (LA) with confident information coverage (CIC) model, this article presented an energy-efficient sensor scheduling strategy for partial CIC coverage in IoT-based BSHM system to guarantee network coverage and prolong network lifetime. The proposed scheme fully exploits cooperation among deployed nodes and alternatively schedules the wake/sleep status of nodes while satisfying network connectivity and partial coverage ratio. Especially, the proposed scheme takes full advantage of the LA model to adaptively learn the optimal sensor scheduling strategy and significantly extend network lifetime. A series of comparison simulations using real data sets collected by a practical BSHM system strongly verify the effectiveness and energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

In this regard, the first part of this paper presents comprehensive maintenance for power transformers aiming to diagnose transformer faults more accurately. Specifically, it aims to identify incipient faults in power transformers using what is known as dissolved gas analysis (DGA) with a new proposed integrated method. This proposed method for DGA is implemented based on the integration among the results of five different DGA techniques; 1) conditional probability, 2) clustering, 3) Duval triangle, 4) Roger’s four ratios refined, and 5) artificial neural network. Accordingly, this proposed integrated DGA method could improve the overall accuracy by 93.6% compared to the existing DGA techniques. In addition, the second part used for predictive maintenance is based on determining the health index for five new transformers and an aged power transformer (66/11 kV, 40 MVA) filled with NYTRO 10XN oil by evaluating the breakdown voltage, DGA, moisture content, and acidity for the oil. In the breakdown voltage test, two practical types of transformer oil; NYTRO 10XN and HyVolt III alongside their mixtures are estimated and compared. In addition, aged oil samples extracted from a real case study in-service transformer during operation with different aged durations; 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years, are tested for breakdown voltage, and then compared with fresh oil samples. For DGA, a temperature rise test is performed on the five new transformers with a comparison between dissolved gases before and after the temperature rise. In addition, winding resistance is measured after the temperature rise. Also, acidity and moisture are measured for oils extracted from the new five transformers and from the 13-year in-service transformer for studying their health index. The health index of the transformer insulation system is examined using only DGA and DGA plus breakdown voltage (BDV), moisture, and acidity. The results show that by using DGA plus BDV, moisture, and acidity, the health index provides reliable estimation results compared to using only DGA.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9726145/,IEEE Access,2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JBHI.2016.2525006,Resource-Aware Mobile-Based Health Monitoring,IEEE,Journals,"Monitoring heart diseases often requires frequent measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at different periods of the day, and at different situations (e.g., traveling, and exercising). This can only be implemented using mobile devices in order to cope with mobility of patients under monitoring, thus supporting continuous monitoring practices. However, these devices are energy-aware, have limited computing resources (e.g., CPU speed and memory), and might lose network connectivity, which makes it very challenging to maintain a continuity of the monitoring episode. In this paper, we propose a mobile monitoring solution to cope with these challenges by compromising on the fly resources availability, battery level, and network intermittence. In order to solve this problem, first we divide the whole process into several subtasks such that each subtask can be executed sequentially either in the server or in the mobile or in parallel in both devices. Then, we developed a mathematical model that considers all the constraints and finds a dynamic programing solution to obtain the best execution path (i.e., which substep should be done where). The solution guarantees an optimum execution time, while considering device battery availability, execution and transmission time, and network availability. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our proposed approach using some key monitoring tasks starting from preprocessing to classification and prediction. The results we have obtained proved that our approach gives the best (lowest) running time for any combination of factors including processing speed, input size, and network bandwidth. Compared to several greedy but nonoptimal solutions, the execution time of our approach was at least 10 times faster and consumed 90% less energy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7397814/,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,March 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/JBHI.2018.2836138,Toward a Model for Personal Health Record Interoperability,IEEE,Journals,"Health information technology, applied to electronic health record (EHR), has evolved with the adoption of standards for defining patient health records. However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format. Unlike other models, OmniPHR presents a unified, structural semantic and up-to-date vision of PHR for patients and healthcare providers.

In general, fault detection and diagnosis techniques for induction motors can be supervised by measuring quantities such as noise, vibration, and temperature. The installation of mechanical sensors in order to assess the health conditions of a machine is typically only done for expensive or load-critical machines, where the high cost of a continuous monitoring system can be justified. Nevertheless, induced current monitoring can be implemented inexpensively on machines with arbitrary sizes by using current transformers. In this regard, effective and low-cost fault detection techniques can be implemented, hence reducing the maintenance and downtime costs of motors. In this work, machine learning techniques have been combined with traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to proposes a simple but yet efficient method for fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors. Raw signals are converted from time domain to frequency domain using FFT. The FFT spectrum are then divided into frequency segments and energy coefficients of each segment are calculated as the sum over the FFT amplitudes. These energy coefficients are used as features for machine learning in our platform. The proposed method is validated on real-world data and achieves a precision of 99.7% for fault detection and 100% for fault classification with minimal expert knowledge requirement. In addition, this approach allows users to be able to optimize/balance risks and maintenance costs to achieve the highest benefit based on their requirements.

The non-invasive nature of peripheral physiological signal measurement via wearables enables ecologically valid long-term monitoring. These peripheral signal measurements can be used in real-time in many ways including health and emotion classification. This paper investigates the utility of peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition using the publicly available DEAP database. Using this database (which contains electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and peripheral signals), this paper compares eight machine learning models in the classification of valence and arousal emotion dimensions. These were applied to the peripheral physiological signals only. These models operate on three groupings of the peripheral data: (i) the raw peripheral physiological signals; (ii) individual feature sets extracted from each peripheral signal; and (iii) a fusion data set made of the combined features from the individual peripheral signals. The results indicate that support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression give the best recognition results on all three data groups considered. The feature fusion data set, which is made up by fusing all the features from the peripheral signals, gives the best recognition accuracy on both valence and arousal dimensions. In addition, subject dependency for emotion classification from peripheral signals is examined and significant individual variability is observed.

Vestibular disorders and their complications have become one of the most common health problems worldwide. Patients with vestibular disorders not only feel uncomfortable in daily living but also have higher risk of stroke. Because of the popularity of vestibular disorders, a good screening method can significantly save resources for hospitals and society. Currently, there are three vestibular disorder diagnostic methods including hearing tests, eye movement tests, and balance tests. The first two methods are sensitive and accurate. However, they require complicated and costly equipment. Among balance test methods, observing the body sway in several postures is a good choice when the testing time needs to be shortened; nonetheless, diagnostic results strongly depend on subjective evaluations of doctors. This paper contributes a solution by introducing a computer-aided method for quantitatively measure the degree of swaying. The proposed algorithm can process real time video captured by a camera, detect two colored stickers attached on the shirt, and calculate the inclination of the patient body. Many sub-processes have been utilized to enhance the measurement accuracy and method applicability. Experiments were performed with a mannequin and human bodies. Results show that angles measured by the proposed method and the reference data are almost equal. The plotted results show remarkably differences between healthy volunteers and patients.

10.1109/PADSW.2018.8644893,A Non-Intrusive Multi-Parameter Fault Diagnosis System for Industrial Machineries,IEEE,Conferences,"Induction motor, especially driving motor, is the critical component for various modern industrial machineries. Fault diagnosis of induction motor is therefore a necessary and crucial task to ensure the machinery health and prevent vital damages. Conventional diagnosis methods are mainly based on intrusive sensors to measure certain physical parameters. However, intrusive sensors are costly and hard to apply to update traditional machines. In this paper, we propose EMFD, an energy-image based non-intrusive multi-parameter fault diagnosis system. We design an EMFD sensing platform to monitor the electric circuit parameters. Then we build a fault model that describes the relationships between two major kinds of faults and the electric circuit parameters. Based on the model, we propose a novel fault diagnosis algorithm that exploits a sparse auto-encoder based deep neural network. Different from the existing single-parameter methods, EMFD takes advantage of multiple circuit parameters and achieves accurate and robust diagnosis even in dynamic operating environments. We implement and deploy the proposed system in a real-world factory. The evaluation results show that EMFD can achieve the diagnosis accuracy of 96 %.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8644893/,2018 IEEE 24th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS),11-13 Dec. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

And the collection, transport, processing, disposal and monitoring of these wastes is called as Industrial Waste Management. Industrial Waste has adhered to severe pollution to air, water and soil in the recent years affecting environment and human health. So, its proper and effective management has become important also as the industries’ liability towards the environment. Since many industries don’t have in-house processing plants, they tie-up with industries for the task. This paper focuses on using Q-learning for effective path-planning from generator industries(waste generating) to aggregator industries(waste processing). Q-learning is used for predicting the most efficient path by learning from its own experiences of rewards and penalties and so we don’t need to train the model which therefore increases the efficiency. This work can be implemented at a place where industrial waste is generated and can be very helpful in managing the same. This could be implemented as a service and handed over to the probable customers or government organizations which provide waste management services to the industries.

Deep learning is widely used in academia due to its strong self-learning ability. However, as a ""black-box"" model, the features extracted by deep learning have poor interpretability which can’t be understood by IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel fault diagnosis method based on ensemble feature selection. We separately evaluate our method on the four-fault hydraulic components, which are derived from the real-world hydraulic time series data sets. The results show that compared with the deep learning method the proposed method can greatly reduce the complexity of the model without much reduction accuracy.

The key challenge in early detection of the corona virus is early detection. And the main obstacle was the similarity of COVID-19 symptoms to flu symptoms. With the goal of saving human lives and stemming the spread of a worldwide pandemic, an accurate and speedy analysis of COVID-19-induced pneumonia has now taken centre stage. Responding this urgent concern and to reduce the burden as well as chances of faulty manual diagnosis, several deep learning approaches are developed to conduct early diagnosis. Based on the availability of reliable patient's records, an accepted technique is pre-trained deep learning prediction approach through patient's chest X-Rays. Convenience of this approach led development of a number of novel deep learning-based lung screening technologies. However, little emphasis is placed on ensuring the quality of their output. Pre-trained deep learning systems will be used in this project to evaluate their ability to recognise and diagnose disorders. To categorise COVID and normal pictures, a neural network-based ResNet50 architecture is presented. The implementation is based on the normal, COVID, and lung opacity datasets. For data pre-processing, ImageDataGenerator is used, which rescales, flips, and modifies the range to meet the model. To categorise the x- ray images, the suggested method ResNet50 architecture is used. Performance matrices like precision, accuracy, recall, as well as F1-score are examined to verify the algorithm's usefulness. The suggested technique has an accuracy of 80%, indicating that the proposed model is quite good in classifying COVID and normal x-ray pictures.

The FusaHum graminearum Sehw., special fugus always damages the wheat ear, and produces vomitoxin,is difficult to control and prevent, and seriously threatens the health of humans, animals and China's food security. Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display. The Service-Terminal was completed by the mixed programming of Myeclipse and Matlab software, and Tomcat was used as the Server. It mainly implements the functions of image receiving, image preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier modeling. The MySQL was used to establish two databases: the “Disease Characteristics Database” and the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base”. Finally, through samples testing and validating, the Android-based mobile terminal can real-time collect the image of Fusarium head blight and upload the server. After the target image was processed and compared by the “Disease Characteristics Database”, the appropriate diagnostic knowledge was selected from the “Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base” and feedbacked to the client.

However, despite the valuable advantages, this new reality increases the cybersecurity and privacy concerns since vulnerable IoMT devices can access and handle autonomously patients’ data. Furthermore, the continuous evolution of cyberattacks, malware and zero-day vulnerabilities require the development of the appropriate countermeasures. In the light of the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), which can protect the healthcare communications that rely on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). HTTP is commonly adopted by conventional healthcare-related services, such as web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) applications, while Modbus/TCP is an industrial protocol adopted by IoMT. Although the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods have already demonstrated their efficacy in detecting intrusions, the rarely available intrusion detection datasets (especially in the healthcare sector) complicate their global application. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that an active learning approach is modelled and adopted in order to re-train dynamically the supervised classifiers behind the proposed IDPS.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery. The novelty of this work shows, the method to predict the future power demand by updating its model parameters and without any initial SoC calculation.

So they are always looking for appetizing food and junk foods are the largest source of it. Recent time the most observable point is that peoples are attracted to outdoor foods than homemade foods. As a result our dietary is changing and we are leaning to junk food day by day which causes a bad effect on our health and increases the risk of health disorders. Machine learning facts are being used in every inch of our life and recognizing object through image processing is one of those. Although, the reason of foods being different in nature make this process critical where traditional approaches will be the cause of a poor accuracy rate. Deep Neural Network has outperformed all of these problems. In this study, we tried to recognize local junk foods based on a new dataset consist of 2000 data belonging 5 junk food classes. All the data in the data set were collected using Smart-phone camera and believed to be unique in every sense. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) technology was used to reach the goal which is renowned for image processing. Throughout the study we achieve an accuracy of 90.47% which turned out to be satisfying. Furthermore we did test based on real-life scenario and the result was out of the mark. Our ambition is to take this study to the next level which will be implemented on another study later on.

Remediation relies on up-to-date and accurate attack signatures. Signature-based detection is relatively inexpensive computationally. Yet, signatures are inflexible when small variations exist in the attack vector. Attackers exploit this rigidity by altering their attacks to bypass the signatures. Our previous work revealed a critical problem with conventional machine learning models. Conventional models are unable to generalize on the temporal nature of network flow data to classify attacks. We thus explored the use of deep learning techniques on real flow data. We found that a variety of attacks could be identified with high accuracy compared to previous approaches.

10.1109/CyberC.2017.71,ActiRecognizer: Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Human Activity Recognition System,IEEE,Conferences,"In our society, inadequate physical activity is one of severe problems issues for human health, which may increase the health risks of many diseases. Nowadays, smartphones are ubiquitous and widely used around the world, in which multi-functional sensors and wireless interfaces are embedded. Therefore, smartphone is viewed as an appropriate platform for real-time activity recognition to address these healthy problems by monitoring and detecting user's everyday activities. In this paper, unlike other wearable devices based applications (e.g., watches, bands, or clip-on devices), ActiRecognizer, a smartphone-based prototype of a real-time human activity recognition (HAR) is designed and implemented, in which a detailed activity report of individuals (i.e. a pie chart containing the proportion and duration of each activity) can be correspondingly generated based on the detected real-time activities. Specifically, ActiRecognizer adopts client/server (C/S) architecture. At client side, smartphone associated with each individual periodically uploads the accelerometer and gyroscope sensing data to server for activity recognition and monitoring. At serve side, HAR is composed of offline training phase and online activity recognition phase: in training phase, sensing data are collected to extract the desired features that can appropriately characterize behaviors, classification model is generated utilizing these features, and then the trained classification model is used to classify user activity in real time.

10.1109/MDM.2016.87,Active Learning for On-Line Partial Discharge Monitoring in Noisy Environments,IEEE,Conferences,"Partial discharge (PD) results from deterioration to the insulation of high voltage equipment in power grids, such as transformers, switch gears, and cable terminals. PD monitoring is a promising approach that ensures the reliable performance of electrical assets through condition based maintenance. Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to discover features and specific patterns that can differentiate between partial discharges and noise. On-line PD monitoring systems have been recently deployed for continuously assessing the equipment health, so that its maintenance requires minimal cost and shorter disruption to operational services. However, labelled data is required in order to build predictive models for on-line PD monitoring. Labelled data is expensive to obtain since it requires expert input. In addition, in real scenarios the ratio of noise pulses to real PDs can be high, making the learning task harder. This paper investigates an active learning (AL) approach for streaming data that aims to maintain an on-line model that is robust to class imbalances. The empirical evaluation, using real HFCT sensor data, shows that the proposed AL approach is able to achieve over 80% accuracy in noisy scenarios with minimal expert dependence (only 2% of the labelled instances).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7551566/,2016 17th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),13-16 June 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ICCAD45719.2019.8942124,Adar: Adversarial Activity Recognition in Wearables,IEEE,Conferences,"Recent advances in machine learning and deep neural networks have led to the realization of many important applications in the area of personalized medicine. Whether it is detecting activities of daily living or analyzing images for cancerous cells, machine learning algorithms have become the dominant choice for such emerging applications. In particular, the state-of-the-art algorithms used for human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable inertial sensors utilize machine learning algorithms to detect health events and to make predictions from sensor data. Currently, however, there remains a gap in research on whether or not and how activity recognition algorithms may become the subject of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first strides on (1) investigating methods of generating adversarial example in the context of HAR systems; (2) studying the vulnerability of activity recognition models to adversarial examples in feature and signal domain; and (3) investigating the effects of adversarial training on HAR systems. We introduce Adar11Software code and experimental data for Adar are available online at https://github.com/rameshKrSah/Adar., a novel computational framework for optimization-driven creation of adversarial examples in sensor-based activity recognition systems.

10.1109/ICTer51097.2020.9325474,Adjusting The Hard Level on Game by a Prediction for Improving Attraction and Business Value,IEEE,Conferences,"The computer gaming industry has become more popular among the young generation over the years. It became a sport and According to past studies, people choose computer games over physical games (outdoor games) due to their busy lifestyles which crack social relationships and fear of injuries. There are around 2.2 billion gamers around the world. Out of the assessed 7.6 billion individuals living on earth, as of July 2018, that implies nearly 33% of individuals on this planet are gamers. Out of those 2.2 billion gamers, 1.2 billion of the players play PC game. An online survey was conducted to collect information from random game players and non-game players scattered throughout Sri Lanka to identify the problems faced by them when playing the games and why others do not play the game or are discouraged to play games. 354 participants participated in this survey. In which 127 of the participants were Female and 227 Male. The participation age range was identified as 15 to 49 Years. The research team was able to summarize that 80.04% of the participants play games while 19.06% don't play games. Out of the participants who play games, 9.08% are pro players while the rest of the 78% of players are intermediate players. We identified that the main problems faced by most of the players are as follows: Some missions are too easy and boring or players getting stuck in the middle of the level because the level is too hard or because the mission is too hard to complete. The Popularity of games can be varied according to the players' skill level. Tasks of a game can be boring if it's too easy for a skilled player. On the other hand, if it's too hard for a beginner level player, it may tend to give up the game. The other problem identified was the inability of game character customization as per the preference of 92.07% of gamers who participated in the survey. According to their responses, we were able to understand the problems that they faced while playing the game and what they expect in a game. Therefore, the research team proposes a game that changes the level of hardness/complexity of the level according to the players' mood automatically. In simple terms, the game will `adjust and adopt' based on the user's emotions. The next level will be automatically designed based on the player record of the previous level using an algorithm that takes the emotions as inputs. To achieve this, the gamer's heart pulse rate, facial expression, and speed of using the controls are captured and analysed to obtain the most accurate emotion level of the player using machine learning. The level of emotions is taken along with the parameters such as age, gender, and haptic feedback to adjust the hardness level of the level.It is important to identify the player skill level to understand the user's experience as a gamer. To determine a player's skill level in the background, a keylogger captures the pressed key and the time it takes to press the key. It is also necessary to identify the emotional state of the player to provide a unique user experience to the player and it can be done in two ways which are facial expression and heart-pulse. Facial expression detection results in identifying and predicting the basic emotions of an individual such as happiness, anger, and neutral which will be necessary for the adaptive game, and also the emotional range of a player is predicted. Additionally, age, gender, and face-shape are determined. The dataset is trained using machine learning to detect the facial expression and identify the emotion, age, gender, and face-shape of the individual. The Facial Expression of the player will be captured in real-time from the web camera of the computer and the emotion will be identified automatically as well as the age gender and face-shape. The other method is through Heart pulse, Heart pulse also can be used to detect the emotions of the player. There are 3 types of emotion levels Happy, Fear, Neutral. To do this, the heart rate sensor is used to capture the player's heart rate. According to the output received after training the dataset using machine learning algorithms and the skill level output is used to adjust the level of the game while the gamer is playing the game. To obtain a much more accurate emotional level, the heartbeat level, and the facial emotional level are analysed together. We have created a new model for analysing the above data using linear regression. Using the said model, the gender, age, the skill level of the player as well as the difficulty in the level of the game can be identified. The next level of the game will be designed using the data from the previous level and this process will continue until the player quits the game. A model is trained by using machine learning technology to predict character characteristics (moving speed, health regenerating) of the game character. The difficulty level of the player is taken as input for the training process. The output characteristics are given by an in-game module and adjust the characteristics of the game character until the player quits playing. The AI algorithm performs the process of reflecting the characteristics of the player to the in-game character. Age, gender, and face-shape are used as input data. The algorithm process input data to generate a unique set of variables. The variables manipulate the appearance of the in-game character until the player quits playing. Our game is developed within three months; therefore, it is difficult to predict the emotions or obtain a skill level like in an existing commercialized game because the demo game doesn't evoke any emotions or measure the skill level of the player. So, we have tested our application with the other similar existing games and we were able to obtain an accurate emotion and skill level. Even though the game is designed in a way to change the levels and character abilities based on the inputs obtained, we can't do so in other existing games. Therefore, the player records obtained from the games we tested were taken into a text record and analysed separately. Based on the analysed data we were able to obtain an accuracy level of 68%.In the future, the demo game will be further developed and tested with our system to obtain an emotion. The option of changing the game character based on the player's appearance is 75% successful, in which face-shape and gender were used. In the future, we will be using age as well. In the future a profile can be designed based on skill level, therefore making it possible to adjust the game based on a player's past record.This system provides a solution to problems faced by the game players such as the game being too easy and boring or hard and stressful. This can also prevent health issues that can be caused when a person gets too angry or violent and stress.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9325474/,2020 20th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer),4-7 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

New methods have to be introduced to reduce the usage of weedicide. Even after the advancement in research, a lot of readily available solutions are not being implemented at the grass-root level. Addressing the problem, a better solution has been proposed to minimize the usage of the herbicide by classifying the plant images into the weed and the crop for selective spraying of the herbicide. The first step towards it is to differentiate between the crops and the weed. Image Classification Technique has been implemented using the Deep Learning function. A maximum efficiency of 96.3% was achieved with just 250 images of each plant in the dataset.

Smart-phones are used in personal health care or monitoring activities of elderly persons. These types of smartphone applications require continuous authentication of the user for taking action in case of detachment of the smartphone from the user due to forgetfulness or theft. Continuous authentication on smartphone requires authentication process having low computational overhead. In this work, the objective is to develop low cost user authentication algorithm from time series data of user activities taken from sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope. Deep neural networks are used for user authentication.

In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

With the rise of artificial intelligence deep learning in recent years, various analytical software resources have gradually become easier to obtain. At the same time, wearable cyber physical sensors are becoming more and more popular. Measurements on vital signs such as heartbeat, electrocardiogram, and blood oxygenation blood pressure values are ubiquitous. We propose an integrated system that combines dialysis big data deep learning analysis with cross platform physiological sensing. We specifically tackle the early warning of dialysis discomfort such as hypotension, hypertension, cramps, etc., this requires a large amount of data collection, related training, data sources including dialysis treatment process and home physiological data. Although the Dialysis machine is able to produce huge amount of IoT data, the usable data for early warning system training is not as huge due to the limited physician labors devoted for labeling questionable samples. This generally leads to low accuracy for regular CNN training methods. We enhance the AI training performance via a transfer learning technique. The AI training accuracy reaches the value of 99% with the help of transfer learning, while that of an original CNN process on the HD data bears a low 60% accuracy. Given the high prediction accuracy of our AI engine, we are able to integrate the real time measurements from Dialysis machine with wearable devices such as ECG sensors and wrist health watches, and make precision prediction of incoming discomfort during the HD treatments.

The number of IoT devices has increased 31% year-over-year to 8.4 billion in 2017 and it is estimated that there will be 30 billion devices by 2020. Water pollution is a major environmental problem in India. The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage. Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry that results in polluting, most of the rivers, lakes and surface water in India. In this paper, An IoT Based Smart Water Quality Monitoring System using Cloud and Deep Learning is proposed to monitor the quality of the water in water-bodies. In conventional systems, the monitoring process involves the manual collection of sample water from various regions, followed by laboratory testing and analysis. This process is ineffective, as this process is arduous and time-consuming and it does not provide real-time results. The quality of water should be monitored continuously, to ensure the safe supply of water from any water bodies and water resources. Hence, the design and development of a low-cost system for real-time monitoring of water quality using the Internet of Things (IoT) is essential. Monitoring water quality in water bodies using Internet of Things (IoT) helps in combating environmental issues and improving the health and living standards of all living things. The proposed system monitors the quality of water relentlessly with the help of IoT devices, such as, NodeMCU. The in-built Wi-Fi module is attached in NodeMCU which enables internet connectivity transfers the measured data from sensors to the Cloud.

The ever increasing number of connected things or objects (IoT) is coupled with a growing volume of data generated at a continually increasing rate. Especially where data is big or there is a need to process it, cloud infrastructures, with their scalability and easy access, are becoming the solution of choice for storage and processing. In the context of healthcare applications, where medical sensors collect health data from patients and send it to the cloud, two issues frequently appear in relation to “Big Data”. The first issue is related to real-time analysis introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated especially from connected devices (IoT). This data should be analyzed continuously in real-time in order to take appropriate actions regarding the patient's care plan. Moreover, medical data accumulated from different patients over time constitutes an important training dataset that can be used to train machine learning models in order to perform smarter disease prediction and treatment. This gives rise to another issue regarding long-term batch processing of often huge volumes of stored data. To deal with these issues, we propose an IoT-Cloud based framework for real-time and batch processing of Big Data in the healthcare domain.

In order to enable real time onboard diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, mechanisms for reading, manipulating and analyzing the data need to be architected into the onboard system. Machine learning and statistical algorithms provide tools to develop data models for enabling prognostics that are typically developed off-board by mining historical data. Once trained, the logic of processing real time data is then embedded on a real time onboard system. A straightforward approach for incorporating the knowledge and intelligence for real time data processing is to add the needed logic and algorithms as an integral part of the onboard software. While this method can serve the purpose of enabling real time health assessment and analysis, it is very restrictive in nature. Every time the analytics need to be updated or algorithms need refinement, it requires a refresh of the complete onboard software. The ability to fine tune onboard embedded logic for the purpose of making the analysis smarter is crucial for creating a successful and sound health monitoring system. In addition, it is desired that the process of encoding logic and algorithms should be simple and easy to incorporate into the system. User friendliness of the process of embedding intelligent logic is critical for long term maintenance of the system as well. This paper discusses an approach to build algorithms and logic into an onboard system such that they are programmatically decoupled from the onboard software. The approach described in this paper allows users the ease of use and flexibility in building knowledge into the system.

Identifying patients with high readmission risk and paying additional attention to them can ease the burden on both patients and society. Recently, considerable attention has been paid to personalized readmission predictions, i.e., building an independent model for each target patient. However, existing personalized predictive models can be easily affected by data insufficiency and provide poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose the CLusterbased mUlti-task lEarning model (CLUE) to achieve personalized hospital readmission prediction. CLUE groups patients into different clusters based on a multi-angle similarity metric to preserve the interrelated information of patients with highly similar clinical behaviors. Due to different group characteristics of patients, the clusters of patients are imbalanced. Given that, CLUE treats the hospital readmission prediction for each cluster of patients as one task and learns multiple tasks jointly by parameter sharing mechanisms. In this way, not only can the data insufficiency problem be alleviated by supplementing individual models with the shared information from other clusters, but also the specific information of each cluster can be preserved for personalization.

One application that is particularly relevant in today's digital era is the alignment of scanned or camera-captured document images such as insurance claim forms for information extraction. Traditional learning based approaches perform poorly due to the absence of an appropriate gradient. Feature based keypoint extraction techniques for homography estimation in real scene images either detect an extremely large number of inconsistent keypoints due to sharp textual edges, or produce inaccurate keypoint correspondences due to variations in illumination and viewpoint differences between document images. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for aligning scanned or camera-captured document images using character based keypoints and a reference template. The algorithm is both fast and accurate and utilizes a standard Optical character recognition (OCR) engine such as Tesseract to find character based unambiguous keypoints, which are utilized to identify precise keypoint correspondences between two images.

Classical model-based prognostics require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest and oftentimes assume certain stochastic or random processes. To overcome the limitations of model-based methods, data-driven methods such as machine learning have been increasingly applied to prognostics and health management (PHM). While machine learning algorithms are able to build accurate predictive models, large volumes of training data are required. Consequently, machine learning techniques are not computationally efficient for data-driven PHM. The objective of this research is to create a novel approach for machinery prognostics using a cloud-based parallel machine learning algorithm. Specifically, one of the most popular machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest) is applied to predict tool wear in dry milling operations.

Town councils have to regularly collect different types of wastes to clean cities/towns. Hence managing the waste of the cities is a challenging task. However, most of the urban councils currently use a manual approach to managing waste. However, it results in many difficulties for the people and cleaning staff who involve in the process by following strict guidelines. Issues due to waste contamination, no proper information management of waste collection, and no punctuality in removing waste from the garbage bins are some of the significant issues arising from the manual process. Due to the drawbacks of the manual approach, social issues, environmental issues, health issues can occur easily.

These platforms allow humans to interact with machines through sensing, control and actuation functions in ways not imaginable a few decades ago. While robust control techniques aim to maintain autonomous system performance in the presence of bounded modeling errors, they are not designed to manage large multi- parameter variations and internal component failures that are inevitable during lengthy periods of field deployment. To address the trustworthiness of autonomous systems in the field, we propose a cross-layer error resilience approach in which errors are detected and corrected at appropriate levels of the design (hardware-through software) with the objective of minimizing the latency of error recovery while maintaining high failure coverage. At the control processor level, soft errors in the digital control processor are considered. At the system level, sensor and actuator failures are analyzed. These impairments define the health of the system. A methodology for adapting the control procedure of the autonomous system to compensate for degraded system health is proposed.

In addition, Research on healthcare services that can collect bio signal data through wearable sensors using IoT technology and monitor and manage health based on the collected data is increasing significantly. In particular, in a situation where the world is entering a rapidly aging society, health care services are being researched and developed in the direction of preventing diseases in advance and maintaining a healthy life. Healthcare services are bringing important changes in the pandemic era caused by covid-19. There is a need for a system capable of efficiently sharing and exchanging information of heterogeneous services to prevent emergencies and support optimal medical services. In this paper, we designed and developed a system that can collect, convert, and store bio-signals from various wearable sensors into international standard data to develop such healthcare services. HL7 (health level seven) FHIR (fast healthcare interoperability resources) applied mutandis in this paper is a standard protocol for data exchange between medical information systems of real-time collected bio signals. In this paper, we implement an interface module that converts bio signals such as EEG (electroencephalography), ECG (electrocardiogram), EMG (electromyography), and PPG (photoplethysmography) collected in real time from a wearable sensor into a message structure defined by HL7 FHIR. The interface module consists of a client part and a server part. The client part generates a variety of signal data from the healthcare service user and delivers the message to the server part. The server part is designed and implemented to parse the received message by segment field unit and transmit whether the message is abnormal or not to the client part.

However, wearable devices having real-time cardiac health monitoring aids individuals as well as medical professionals in the timely diagnosis of fatal heart diseases, such as arrhythmia. This paper proposes a low power VLSI architecture that facilitates the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) into normal and other seven types of arrhythmia beats using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Unlike the existing methods for heartbeat classification, in which handcrafted ECG features are utilised, the proposed design leverages DNN for the classification of arrhythmia using a complete ECG beat.

A particularly contentious issue was lockdown orders issued by state governments designed to keep citizens safe by controlling the spread of the virus. To compel the government to relax these orders and restore normalcy, antilockdown protests were organized in many states. The economic, ideological, political, and health concerns related to the lockdowns and the associated protests were debated vigorously on social media platforms, many times using offensive content. Detecting such insulting and humiliating content is especially important during tumultuous times, when tensions are high, because such expressions online can quickly precipitate violence in the physical world. This paper presents an approach to detect hateful and offensive content from Twitter feeds collected after anti-lockdown protests in Lansing, Michigan. These tweets were labeled using a comprehensive definition of what constitutes offensive content based on its potential to trigger and incite people. Linguistic and auxiliary features were extracted from these labeled tweets. These features were further processed through feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques. The preprocessed feature set was used to train machine learning models, which detect offensive content with an accuracy of around 84%. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and tagging offensive content in politically motivated situations, even when such speech is dominated by contextual and circumstantial information. It can thus be used to mitigate the damage caused by widespread dissemination of offensive content.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9529358/,"2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",12-16 July 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This system can help reduce traffic accidents and save the lives of drivers. This work trains a Convolutional Neural Network and uses it to assess whether the driver&#x0027;s eyes are closed or open. The dataset comprises images acquired from a large portion of the MRL eye dataset. Before training, the proposed model processes the images in the dataset using computer vision techniques such as edge detection, grayscale conversion, and dilation. The Google MediaPipe Face mesh model is then used to track facial landmarks from video frames in real-time. The eyes region is retrieved, processed, and fed to the proposed trained model for prediction. The model detects drowsiness and alarms the driver to take safety measures. This paper proposes and implements a CNN model that achieves an overall accuracy of 95&#x0025;, outperforming all previous studies on drowsiness detection.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9777182/,2022 6th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI),28-30 April 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/SOCIALMEDIA.2017.8057360,ECG classification and prognostic approach towards personalized healthcare,IEEE,Conferences,"A very important aspect of personalized healthcare is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the tele health analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system focused on `preventive care rather than remedial cure' which has become a major focus of all the health care and cure institutions across the globe.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8057360/,"2017 International Conference On Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)",19-20 June 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The introduction of auto milking systems makes management of farms and udder health more efficient and auto detection systems for common diseases in dairy farms, which are implemented auto milking systems and detect the diseases based on some measurements while milking, are needed. In this study, we propose a novel model for subclinical mastitis detection. Our dataset was collected from dairy farms in Japan and labeled using risk values calculated by a commercially available milk analyzer based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in order to train our model. Several measurements that can be obtained from any auto milking system, such as electrical conductivity in milk, were used as time series features. The models were trained using machine learning (a support vector machine or random forest) and their performances were compared. Our model detects the onset of subclinical mastitis with an accuracy of 81% in terms of sensitivity and 46% precision. In addition, some cases of subclinical mastitis can be detected earlier than when using an alert system based on LDH.

Epidemiological data analysis plays a crucial role in disease prevention and control. Conventional methods such as moving average or autoregressive analysis normally require the assumption of stationarity, which is often violated in epidemiologic time series. This paper proposes the fusion of neural networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms, with the aim to strengthen the modeling power for epidemiological dynamics. We deploy an additive fuzzy system into a neural network architecture in order to incorporate recurrent nodes to enable the fuzzy system to handle temporal data. The genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the fuzzy rule structure before supervised training is applied to adjust parameters. As epidemiological time series exhibit complex behavior and possibly cyclic patterns, the addition of recurrent nodes to the fuzzy system improves the modeling capability.

Failure indicators are characteristics of internal states and behavior of a system which indicate potential failures. However, previous studies mostly focused on extracting failure indicators from network and hardware outside of a software system or operating system level, neglected the runtime dynamics on application level. Besides, most of these studies aimed at detecting and predicting performance-related failures. As a major category of software failures, content failures are often omitted. This paper proposes an experiment-based approach to extract interaction-related failure indicators on application level for content failures, composed of abnormal execution time of modules and abnormal interaction times between modules. Firstly, an experiment-based failure data generation method is proposed due to a lack of real-world failure data which can reflect the runtime states and behavior of a software system. Then a machine learning method is selected and applied on the failure dataset to construct classifiers for normal data and failure data, from which failure indicators are extracted. Finally, three open-source software were selected to show the validity of our extracting method and the effectiveness of the extracted failure indicators. Interaction-related failure indicators extracted by the proposed approach can be used for runtime failure detection and prediction of content failures, thus improving runtime dependability of complex software-intensive systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8539208/,2018 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW),15-18 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, YOLOv4 deep learning model is designed and applied deep transfer learning approach to create a face mask detector which can be used in real time. GPU used was Google Collab to run the simulations and to draw inferences. Proposed implementation considered three types of data as input such as image dataset, video dataset and real time data for face mask detection.

Fall detection is the most important health care issue for the elderly. In computer vision domain, significant breakthrough technologies such as deep learning have been obtained for over five years. Deep learning belongs to computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from training data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a specific type of deep learning, have set the state-of-the-art image classification performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in recent years. In this paper, we present the use of convolutional neural networks for fall detection in video surveillance environment. CNN is directly applied to each frame image in the video to learn human shape deformation features that describe different postures of the human and determine if a fall occurs. Experimental results show that our proposed approach runs in real-time and achieves average accuracy of 99.98% for 10-fold cross-validation for fall detection.

This fact has highlighted the need of fall detection systems. Various fall detection systems have been proposed. The proposed systems commonly used special devices placed at several position of user's body. On the other hand, smartphones with various sensors including gyroscopes are available in the market nowadays. This has motivated us to propose a prototype system of fall detection application designed for a smart phone. A threshold based fall detection algorithm is adapted for the proposed system since it relatively requires lower computational processes compared to complex reasoning techniques. Hence is more suitable to be implemented in smart phones with limited resource and processing power. The basic idea of the algorithm is to detect dynamic situations of posture, followed by unintentional falls to lying postures. The algorithm monitors sets of linear acceleration data and angular velocity and compares them to set of thresholds obtained from training data from the observed user.

The goal of depression detection is to improve diagnostic accuracy and availability, leading to faster intervention. The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust depression detection model. To this end, there are two challenges to overcome: 1) Multi-modal (audio, image, text, etc.) information must be jointly considered to make accurate inferences. 2) Existing deep learning-based work suffers from multi-modal data sufficiency problem. To address these issues, we propose a graph attention model embedded with multi-modal knowledge for depression detection.

These devices significantly improve the patient's lifestyle as they permit remote monitoring and transmission of health data (i.e., telemedicine), lowering the treatment costs for both the patient and the healthcare providers. Although specific SHS communication standards (i.e., ISO/IEEE 11073) enable real-time plug-and-play interoperability and communication between different personal medical devices, they do not specify any features for secure communications. In this paper, we demonstrate how personal medical device communication is indeed vulnerable to different cyber attacks. Specifically, we show how an external attacker can hook into the personal medical device's communication and eavesdrop the sensitive health data traffic, and implement manin-the-middle, replay, false data injection, and denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, we also propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), HEKA, to monitor personal medical device traffic and detect attacks on them. HEKA passively hooks into the personal medical traffic generated by medical devices to learn the contiguous sequence of packets information from the captured traffic and detects irregular traffic-flow patterns using an n-grambased approach and different machine learning techniques. We implemented HEKA in a testbed consisting of eight off-the-shelf personal medical devices and evaluated its performance against four different attacks.

However, these models were not evaluated in the way as they are used in real-world data centers. Moreover, the hard drives deteriorate gradually, but these models can not describe this gradual change precisely. This paper proposes new hard drive failure prediction models based on Classification and Regression Trees, which perform better in prediction performance as well as stability and interpretability compared with the state-of the-art model, the Back propagation artificial neural network model. Experiments demonstrate that the Classification Tree (CT) model predicts over 95% of failures at a false alarm rate (FAR) under 0.1% on a real-world dataset containing 25,792 drives. Aiming at the practical application of prediction models, we test them with different drive families, with fewer number of drives, and with different model updating strategies. The CT model still shows steady and good performance. We propose a health degree model based on Regression Tree (RT) as well, which can give the drive a health assessment rather than a simple classification result. Therefore, the approach can deal with warnings raised by the prediction model in order of their health degrees.

However, the usual presence of several hundreds of similarly looking, but completely different types of blister packages, in a crowded dispensing station makes it prone to human error, posing serious safety and health concerns for a patients life. In this work, we propose a highlighted deep learning (HDL) based approach for accurate identification of blister packages. HDL allows smart manipulation on raw data in order to better segment the identified targets and to expose inherent descriptive features, thus facilitating an accurate deep learning based classification process. Specifically, HDL uses automatic detection and then segments and processes the raw blister pack images irrespective of position, lighting variations, etc., making them suitable for CNN to classify the correct blister pack types. A ResNet CNN classifier has been trained using the processed images, and the resultant CNN model is finally deployed for classification. We have conducted an extensive experiment at the adult lozenge dispensing station of MacKay Memorial Hospital.

As per all SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) it is advisable to restrict number of visitors inside these enclosed spaces which are most likely to be weather controlled. Automatic safety compliance thus becomes imperative in such situations. Even though absolute compliance and alert signalling will require scrutiny and cross-checking at several levels, a beginning towards automation of compliance monitoring seems mandatory in the neo-normal era. Hence In this project we have designed a low cost rapidly implementable design to monitor the number of visitors inside the self-contained hall. The system will give signal once the maximum permissible visitor population is reached at a given time. Monitoring the optimal population and the density and enforcing visitor to wear mask even within the space manually is tantamount to imposing health hazards to the person who will physically have to monitor and it may as well render the visitors vulnerable. Here we have used Artificial Intelligence based model person detection and tracking. Real time tracking with accuracy is still an important area in computer vision. There are some commercial solution available for the problem but all of them either implemented considering ideal situation or need huge cost and infrastructure. But as a part of museums community we are passing through a financial crises as due to pandemic we closed for visitors. Hence neither we can afford costly system nor a system designed with ideal condition. This motivates us to develop a new system according to our criteria.

Human trait analysis and identification is a field of research that needs a strong implementation for machine learning. Human trait analysis provides a tool with which human identification factors can be verified. Currently, detail aspects of human behavior are digitally and continuously logged in Big Data based platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

The pioneering work of this technique is in the distinction of the normal and abnormal actions of the users, where the focus is given to these abnormal actions to establish security potential profiles. The data analysis and prediction of the proposed technique is based on the concept of machine learning and uses several models based on four techniques; K-means, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Auto-Encoder Neural Network, and Gaussian Distribution. Experiments have been carried out in four main phases: prediction of rare user actions, filter security potential actions, build/update a user profile, and generate a real-time (i.e. just in time) set of challenging questions.

The decision to offload computation is a communication-computation co-optimization problem that varies with both system parameters (e.g., network condition) and workload characteristics (e.g., inputs). Identifying optimal orchestration considering the cross-layer opportunities and requirements in the face of varying system dynamics is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have been proposed earlier, they suffer from a large number of trial-and-errors during the learning process resulting in excessive time and resource consumption. We present a Hybrid Learning orchestration framework that reduces the number of interactions with the system environment by combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. Our Deep Learning inference orchestration strategy employs reinforcement learning to find the optimal orchestration policy. Furthermore, we deploy Hybrid Learning (HL) to accelerate the RL learning process and reduce the number of direct samplings.

Proper assessment and prediction of outdoor air pollution could significantly warn people about the risk of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including asthma during outdoor exposure. IoT based air quality monitoring through sensors deployed at different locations could be an expedient solution for this. Accurate modeling of the air quality big data collected by the IoT sensors extensively helps in predicting future values for accessing the risk of outdoor exposure. This extraction of knowledge gained could greatly in reducing the deterioration of human health through early warnings and decision-making. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based architecture using CNN-LSTM combination is proposed to model Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of a location with the values collected from the IoT air quality sensors. The encoder-decoder based architecture models the time distributed multivariate air pollutant data of 9 locations. The 3D CNN and 1D CNN is exploited to encode both the inter-dependency (spatial autocorrelation) and intra-dependency (heterogeneity) in the spatiotemporal air pollutant data. The CNN based encoder captures all relevant spatiotemporal features for facilitating improved accuracy in predictions.

10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160454,Hybride neuro-fuzzy expert system for assessing diabetes risk,IEEE,Conferences,There is an increasing number of diabetic diseases in the population. Early diagnosis increases possibility of healing and decreases healing expenses. This paper is focused on modeling of an expert system for assessing diabetes risk using artificial intelligence methods. The model is hierarchical with neuro-fuzzy blocks and voting on the output. Model optimization (learning) is done using the data of real patients acquired in a one public health institution. The expert system is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. Validation of the system shows high sensitivity of 100% which is important for early diagnoses. Specificity is lower - only 90% which means that some patients are sent to further diagnoses although they are healthy. Results indicate that this modeling approach is applicable on assessing diabetes risk. The medical domain knowledge and experience contained in the real data is successfully transferred in the solution model - the proposed expert system. Validation of the proposed expert system indicates that such a system can be used as an auxiliary expert for early diagnoses of diabetes and improve the quality of health systems with lower diagnostic expenses.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160454/,"2015 38th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)",25-29 May 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, there is a lack of an implemented framework that is technically feasible, easily scalable and that provides meaningful variables to be used in applications for translational medicine. This paper describes the implementation and early evaluation of a physiological sensing tool that collects and processes photoplethysmography data from a wearable smartwatch to calculate heart rate variability in real-time. A technical open-source framework is outlined, involving mobile devices for collection of heart rate data, feature extraction and execution of data mining or machine learning algorithms that ultimately deliver mobile health interventions tailored to the users. Eleven volunteers participated in the empirical evaluation that was carried out using an existing mobile virtual reality application for mental health and under controlled slow-paced breathing exercises. The results validated the feasibility of implementation of the proposed framework in the stages of signal acquisition and real-time calculation of heart rate variability (HRV).

Disabled patients need to express their needs non-verbally to their families or medical workers to fulfill their needs immediately. In this study, we developed hand gesture recognition using web camera as a notification system. Image acquisition was done on 12 subjects with various gender and ages. Based on human's basic daily needs, there are 5 gestures as the object of study: need to eat, need to drink, need to go to the toilet, need help and need medicines. The collected images were trained using Single Shot Detector (SSD) algorithm on MobileNet V2 architecture. Among the various deep learning techniques, SSD MobileNet V2 was chosen because it has good ability in object detection and needs low computation. Therefore, it is suitable to be applied on realtime detection. This study results on mean Average Precision (mAP) 44.7% and detection rate 85% which means 85 out of 100 images were well-detected.

PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of long-term prognostics. The SW-ELM is used for ensemble modeling due to its enhanced applicability for real applications as compared to conventional data-driven algorithms.

Studies aiming at modifying such biases with the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) have shown promise in changing maladaptive approach tendencies for addiction-related cues and reducing addictive behavior. However, training effects tend to be small and partly inconsistent. For this reason, we have already developed and evaluated a VR-AAT to improve efficacy of the training. Results showed that our new VR-AAT did not change approach biases, nor other cognitive biases, but it was superior in reducing daily smoking, and both groups improved in other smoking- and health-related variables across time. To further investigate working mechanisms of Approach Bias Modification (ABM), in particular crucial training ingredients, we designed and implemented an extension for our VR-AAT application. This extension takes the form of a virtual bar, which in everyday life represents a risk situation in terms of alcohol and cigarette consumption.

The chronological up-gradation of the latest technology is not amalgamated according to the existing infrastructure and that is why the fatal cases of medical negligence can not be overlooked, specially during any pandemic or epidemic situation. In this work, we have proposed a novel AI-driven network architecture that will proficiently improve the supervision systems inside smart medical care units. vSDN-driven edge servers are responsible for continuous monitoring of patient inflow and outflow inside any hospital and simultaneously provide the health status of the patients using an AI-based Risk Factor (RF) Scale.

Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in occupational safety in the construction industry. However, all the current methods using conventional machine learning with stationary cameras suffer from some severe limitations, perceptual aliasing (e.g., different places/objects can appear identical), occlusion (e.g., place/object appearance changes between visits), seasonal / illumination changes, significant viewpoint changes, etc. This paper proposes a perception module using end-to-end deep-learning and visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for an effective and efficient object recognition and navigation using a differential-drive mobile robot. Various deep-learning frameworks and visual navigation strategies with evaluation metrics are implemented and validated for the selection of the best model. The deep-learning model's predictions are evaluated via the metrics (model speed, accuracy, complexity, precision, recall, P-R curve, F1 score). The YOLOv3 shows the best trade-off among all algorithms, 57.9% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 45 frames per second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a right candidate for deploying the neural network on a mobile robot.

10.1109/SYSTOL.2010.5675940,Intelligent monitoring and fault tolerance in large-scale distributed systems,IEEE,Conferences,"Summary form only. Electronic devices are starting to become widely available for monitoring and controlling large-scale distributed systems. These devices may include sensing capabilities for online measurement, actuators for controlling certain variables, microprocessors for processing information and making realtime decisions based on designed algorithms, and telecommunication units for exchanging information with other electronic devices or possibly with human operators. A collection of such devices may be referred to as a networked intelligent agent system. Such systems have the capability to generate a huge volume of spatial-temporal data that can be used for monitoring and control applications of large-scale distributed systems. One of the most important research challenges in the years ahead is the development of information processing methodologies that can be used to extract meaning and knowledge out of the ever-increasing electronic information that will become available. Even more important is the capability to utilize the information that is being produced to design software and devices that operate seamlessly, autonomously and reliably in some intelligent manner. The ultimate objective is to design networked intelligent agent systems that can make appropriate real-time decisions in the management of large-scale distributed systems, while also providing useful high-level information to human operators. One of the most important classes of large-scale distributed systems deals with the reliable operation and intelligent management of critical infrastructures, such as electric power systems, telecommunication networks, water systems, and transportation systems. The design, control and fault monitoring of critical infrastructure systems is becoming increasingly more challenging as their size, complexity and interactions are steadily growing. Moreover, these critical infrastructures are susceptible to natural disasters, frequent failures, as well as malicious attacks. There is a need to develop a common system-theoretic fault diagnostic framework for critical infrastructure systems and to design architectures and algorithms for intelligent monitoring, control and security of such systems. The goal of this presentation is to motivate the need for health monitoring, fault diagnosis and security of critical infrastructure systems and to provide a fault diagnosis methodology for detecting, isolating and accommodating both abrupt and incipient faults in a class of complex nonlinear dynamic systems.

Data scientists worldwide are attempting to respond to the pandemic by building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions like forecasting pandemic growth, speculating possible mutations, identifying the symptoms caused, and many more. The models require vast quantities of data to make predictions. For a newly identified virus, it may take many months or sometimes years to collect related data and prepare it for data analysis purposes, which can further delay the process of making AI solutions. Hence, there is a need for a pipeline system which can facilitate a quick transmission of medical data from healthcare providers to data scientists. This paper proposes a cloud computing platform that allows smart cities to respond to the pandemic faster, with the collaboration of public health centers and data scientists. The platform provides a structured way of identifying and utilizing collaboration opportunities between health centers and the data science community, generating actionable knowledge. The system consists of two parts: 1) The software on the hospital's side, allowing real-time data gathering and automated uploading to cloud servers, 2) The cloud system to facilitate data storing along with model building and deploying. Customers can use the deployed models on a prepaid basis, the money collected will be divided among data scientists and data providers. This unique feature ensures the healthy participation of data providers in the process of making healthcare solutions for the smart cities. A sponsor can also sponsor a project.

Harmful pesticides enter into the human body through fruits and vegetables, so an optimal solution is needed to recognize the disease and the pesticides in the fruits the common man is consuming. Hardware and a software design are done to obtain an accurate and a real time output. In this paper, a prototype of the system is developed with the use of four sensors, (temperature, gas, pH and moisture), Arduino microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module to get the information about the presence of pesticides. The maximum level of pesticides that is accepted legally to be consumed by animals and humans is given by MRL. If a fruit is detected to belong in a range above or below the MRL then it is said to contain pesticides. Through IoT, the pesticide content and the values obtained from each sensors are stored in the Cloud server MATLAB ThikSpeak. Coming to the software design, CNN and SVM algorithms are chosen and the image of the fruit is diagnosed by them. Two algorithms are mainly used to compare the accuracy produced by both and to select the most accurate between the two. Deep Learning process is performed on the image of the fruit and the disease affected in the fruit is identified and later stored in the Cloud server.

10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431114,Keynote: Explainable-by-design Deep Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"MACHINE and AI justifiably attract the attention and interest not only of the wider scientific community and industry, but also society and policy makers. However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian “black box” society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design. Such systems are able to self-learn lifelong, and continuously improve without the need for complete retraining, can start learning from few training data samples, explore the data space, detect and learn from unseen data patterns, collaborate with humans or other such algorithms seamlessly.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9431114/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops),22-26 March 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Extensive time series logging has been implemented to monitor the health of various infrastructure systems. CPU usage of internal services (e.g., large number of machine learning models built by different teams), network traffic between internet service providers and Facebook data centers, video streaming KPI of live broadcasts generated by daily active users, just to name a few.

Most of these algorithms are applied to two-dimensional wireless networks which do not truly model the real wireless networks. In this paper, a range-free localization method based on multidimensional support vector regression (MSVR) is applied to three-dimensional wireless sensor networks. To solve estimation problem, the location of sensor nodes is formulated using a nonlinear regression model. The accuracy of proposed method is evaluated for isotropic and anisotropic networks. The method has minimum localization error among range-free localization algorithms. Hence, simulation results clearly show that the performance of aforementioned method is better than other pioneer algorithms for such extended networks, and is insusceptible to the ratio of anchor nodes and network density.

Moreover, health monitoring has emphasized the need for edge computing to process real-time data without the bandwidth costs. However, the reconstructed analysis (RA) and the compressed learning (CL) frameworks have extremely high memory and computational overhead, cost-prohibitive for online usage at resource-constrained edge device. In this paper, to efficiently analyze the received CS measurements with different levels of compression, we propose a low-complexity framework of Compressive Analysis in Sub-Eigenspace (CA-SE) based on subspace-based representation. The dictionary is used for sifting the sub-eigen information from the CS measurements online, and it is built by eigenspace learning offline. The framework can reduce the memory overhead with a single light-weight machine learning model and multiple small filter matrices, and the computational complexity with sifting by matrix-vector product rather than sparse coding. CA-SE is implemented in ECG-based atrial fibrillation detection.

Even though there are several technological advancements made in this area, solutions like smartwatches are costly to afford and the solutions that rely on sensors and cameras suffer from privacy concerns. While wireless channel state information-based approaches can address some of these limitations, these approaches either require special hardware to be deployed or modifications at the WiFi access point. In this paper, we propose to detect human activities in a device-agnostic manner by leveraging passively captured passively captured WiFi MAC-layer traffic with the help of a sniffer. In that way, elderly people and those who suffer from chronic health conditions do not need to put any sensors on their body. This approach is not only cost-effective, but it is also easy to deploy without requiring any changes at the WiFi access point or installing special sensors in the environment.

Ideally, it is desirable to make all the features of the collected data private but due to resource limitations, it is not always possible as it may cause overutilization of resources, which in turn affects the performance of the whole system. In this work, we use the generalization techniques for data anonymization and provide customized injective privacy encoder functions to make data features private. Regardless of the resource availability, some data features must be essentially private. All other data features that may pose low privacy threat are termed as nonessential features. We propose Dynamic Iterative Greedy Search (DIGS), a novel approach with corresponding algorithms to select the set of optimal data features to be private for machine learning applications provided device resource constraints. DIGS selects the necessary and the most private version of data for the application, where all essential and a subset of nonessential features are made private on the edge device without resource overutilization. We have implemented DIGS in Python and evaluated it on Raspberry Pi model A (an edge device with limited resources) for an SVM-based classification on real-life health care data. Our evaluation results show that, while providing the required level of privacy, DIGS allows to achieve up to 26.21% memory, 16.67% CPU instructions, and 30.5% of network bandwidth savings as compared to making all the data private.

Traditionally, anomalies are detected by threshold-based alarms for critical metrics, or health probing requests. However, fully automated detection in complex systems is challenging, since it is very difficult to distinguish truly anomalous behavior from normal operation. To this end, the traditional approaches may not be sufficient. Thus, we propose machine learning classifiers to predict the system's health status. We evaluated our approach in an industrial case study, on a large, real-world dataset of 7.5 &#x2022; 10<sup>6</sup> data points for 231 features. Our results show that recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) are more effective in detecting anomalies and health issues, as compared to other classifiers.

The running status of radars are consecutively recorded in time series to monitor the status of different channels. However, due to the large sum of data, the status data is not rigorously used to diagnose possible radar faults. Although the radar can generate alarm codes, but most of them are false alarms which degrade the validity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fault diagnosis approach based on deep learning. Specifically, we formulate the fault diagnosis problem as anomaly detection in large sum of time series. We model the status generated from the radars with an LSTM model and predict the future status based on the historical status data.

One aspect of player immersion is the level of challenge the game presents to the player. To avoid a mismatch between a player's skill and the challenge of a game, which can result from traditional manual difficulty selection mechanisms (e.g. easy, medium, hard), Dynamic Dif­ficulty Adjustment (DDA) has previously been proposed as a means of automatically detecting a player's skill and adjusting the level of challenge the game presents accordingly.

The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions.

However, augmenting buildings with new sensors is often expensive and requires a significant capital investment. In this paper, we propose and describe the real-time, streaming system called Namatad that we developed to infer insights from many sensors typical of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We evaluate the effectiveness of this platform by leveraging machine learning to infer new insights from environmental sensors within buildings. We describe how we built the components of our system leveraging several open source, streaming frameworks. We also describe how we ingest and aggregate from building sensors and sensing platforms, route data streams to appropriate models, and make predictions using machine learning techniques. Using our system, we have been able to predict the occupancy of rooms within a building on the University of Washington campus over the last three months, in real time, at accuracies of up to 95%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7845462/,2016 IEEE 3rd World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),12-14 Dec. 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy approach is developed using two different optimizations of fuzzy inference system (FIS) (i.e. hybrid and backpropagation) to predict the treated Turbidity at Tamburawa water treatment plant (TWTP). Subsequently, a neuro-fuzzy ensemble technique was applied to improve the performance of the two optimizations. For this purpose, the daily recorded data of turbidity (TurbR) (μs/cm), conductivity (CondT) (mS/cm), total dissolve solid (TDSR) (mg/L), chloride (mg/L) and suspended solid (SSR) (mg/L) and Hardness (HardnessT) (mg/L) from TWTP were obtained. The predictive models were evaluated based on two numerical indicators (determination coefficient and root mean square error). The obtained results indicated that neuro-fuzzy hybrid increased the performance accuracy of neuro-fuzzy backpropagation optimization up 16% and 15% in both the training and testing phase respectively. For neuro-fuzzy ensemble results, the performance proved that hybrid ensemble increased the prediction efficiency of backpropagation ensemble up to 18% in the testing phase. Hence, for the prediction of Turbidity in TWTP both the hybrid FIS optimization and ensemble hybrid FIS optimization showed excellent accuracy while for its recommended to employed ensemble techniques in case of backpropagation FIS optimization. The ensemble methodology proved to be implemented as a real-time prediction model that can provide a brilliant approach for environmental sustainability.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8949629/,2019 2nd International Conference of the IEEE Nigeria Computer Chapter (NigeriaComputConf),14-17 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, this poses a major challenge for cloud IaaS providers who cannot control the software programs that users develop, install or download on their rented VMs. Those programs may not be well developed with various bugs or even downloaded/installed together with virus, which often make damages to the VMs or infect the cloud platform. To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform.

However, expressions of parts often have a wide range of variations, spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. Normalization of such terms is crucial for many applications. Part names post a major challenge also because they tend to be in the form of multi-word terms. In this paper, we propose a novel normalization method UNAMER (Unification and Normalization Analysis, Misspelling Evaluation and Recognition). It is a general method for identifying term variants, including multi-word term variants, and normalizing them under a canonical name. UNAMER does not rely on a predefined set of canonical terms, which is often hard to obtain. Given a term, UNAMER first identifies candidate variants by exploiting contextual information. It then uses a supervised machine learning model, trained using easy-to-generate examples, that leverages both contextual and lexical features to predict actual variants from the candidates. UNAMER further extends its capability to normalize multi-word parts, such as part names like `lt pnl', `letf pnl' and `lft panal' for `left panel' using a specialized linguistically motivated term alignment approach. UNAMER has been deployed in practical applications to normalize part names in the aerospace domain.

Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97% accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99.

In recent years, researchers have used deep recurrent neural networks to predict patients' next-period prescriptions. The main challenges of predicting next-period prescriptions are as follows: i) The latent interdependence information which can be utilized to enhance the representation of the data between heterogeneous features is dynamic. However, most existing approaches do not consider capturing and utilizing this information. ii) Conventional recurrent neural networks cannot store historical interdependent information between heterogeneous features and take advantage of it. To address these challenges, We propose a novel attention mechanism named Cross Attention (CA) that can capture the interdependence between two sequences.

This work reports about application of some machine learning methods (linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, support-vector machine) for monitoring energy expenditures in athletes. The classification problem was to predict the known level of the in-exercise loads (in three categories by calories) by the heart rate activity features measured during the short period of time (1 minute only) after training, i.e by features of the post-exercise load. The results obtained shown that the post-exercise heart activity features preserve the information of the in-exercise training loads and allow us to predict their actual in-exercise levels. The best performance can be obtained by the random forest classifier with all 8 heart rate features (micro-averaged area under curve value AUCmicro = 0.87 and macro-averaged one AUCmacro = 0.88) and the k-nearest neighbors classifier with 4 most important heart rate features (AUCmicro =0.91 and AUCmacro =0.89).

Psychologists and sociologists continue to probe downturns influence of economic crisis on mental health and propose social protection programs to promote recovery. The problem, however, is that more than having a social recovery program, it requires personal level efforts to realize and understand what may be coming ahead and rationally solving it, by being more in control of the situation. Considering this context, there are various aims of this paper to evaluate theoretical as well as conceptual illustrations on the reasons behind the negative associations of an economic downturn on population's mental stability, followed by closely examining critical mental distress factors as well as economic distress factors and establishing connection through literature analysis.

Timely recognition of early symptoms of a disease can help avoid the spread of epidemics on the plantations. In this regard, most of the existing solutions use some AI techniques on smart edge devices (IoTs or intelligent Cyber Physical Systems), typically equipped with a hardware like sensors and actuators. However, the resource constraints on such devices like energy (power), memory and computation capability, make the execution of complex operations and AI algorithms (neural network models) for disease detection quite challenging. To this end, compression and quantization techniques offer viable solutions to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks while maximizing performance on the constrained devices. In this paper, we realized a real intelligent CPS on top of which we implemented an AI application, called Deep Leaf running on a microcontroller of the STM32 family, to detect coffee plant diseases with the help of a Quantized Convolutional Neural Network (Q-CNN) model. We present a quantitative analysis of Deep Leaf by comparing five different deep learning models: a 32-bit floating point model, a compressed model, and three different types of quantized models exhibiting differences in terms of accuracy, memory utilization, average inference time, and energy consumption.

Therefore, a lightweight and ready-to-go approach that is able to detect anomalies in real-time is highly sought-after. Such an approach could be easily and immediately applied to perform time series anomaly detection on any commodity machine. The approach could provide timely anomaly alerts and by that enable appropriate countermeasures to be undertaken as early as possible. With these goals in mind, this paper introduces ReRe, which is a Real-time Ready-to-go proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for streaming time series.

Driven by market pressure to reduce cost and maintain quality of services, they are looking for technologies that will allow rapid progress towards attainment of truly automated service delivery. Software monitoring systems are designed to actively collect and signal event occurrences and, when necessary, automatically generate incident tickets. Repeating events generate similar tickets, which in turn have a vast number of repeated problem resolutions likely to be found in earlier tickets. In our work, we develop techniques to recommend an appropriate resolution for incoming events by making use of similarities between the events and historical resolutions of similar events. The traditional KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) algorithm has been first applied to recommend resolutions for incoming tickets. Massive heterogeneous applications as well as various monitoring software are running on clients' servers to accomplish required tasks and to monitor system health via different metrics. It leads to generation of correlated tickets that have different symptom descriptions but similar resolutions. Furthermore, change of servers' environments can also induce similar situations in which ticket descriptions differ before and after change but could have similar resolutions. These correlated tickets cause performance degradation in ticket resolution recommendation. Therefore, we propose using SCL (structural corresponding learning) based feature adaptation to uncover feature mapping in different time intervals. Moreover, to put more insights into the periodic regularities existing in our ticket datasets, we apply our algorithm on tickets grouped by different time interval granularities.

10.1109/IROS.2015.7354310,Robotic agents capable of natural and safe physical interaction with human co-workers,IEEE,Conferences,"Many future application scenarios of robotics envision robotic agents to be in close physical interaction with humans: On the factory floor, robotic agents shall support their human co-workers with the dull and health threatening parts of their jobs. In their homes, robotic agents shall enable people to stay independent, even if they have disabilities that require physical help in their daily life - a pressing need for our aging societies. A key requirement for such robotic agents is that they are safety-aware, that is, that they know when actions may hurt or threaten humans and actively refrain from performing them. Safe robot control systems are a current research focus in control theory. The control system designs, however, are a bit paranoid: programmers build “software fences” around people, effectively preventing physical interactions. To physically interact in a competent manner robotic agents have to reason about the task context, the human, and her intentions. In this paper, we propose to extend cognition-enabled robot control by introducing humans, physical interaction events, and safe movements as first class objects into the plan language. We show the power of the safety-aware control approach in a real-world scenario with a leading-edge autonomous manipulation platform.

It is a three-hidden layer neural network model which was trained using sleep apnea data collected from PhysioNET bank consisting of 8 patient recordings of 8-10hrs of sleep periods. The data consisted of 2293 with apneic segments and 1522 with normal segments. For optimization and weight update, ADAM optimizer was employed, and the loss calculation was performed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) function. The best learned model parameters among multiple epochs were extracted, binarized and then fitted to the testing data set for further evaluation. The proposed design scheme yielded an accuracy of over 85% which is an acceptable rate in sleep diagnosis and screening. The proposed model inference on FPGA consumed power below 5 W which is significantly lower than that of the commercially available hardware accelerators for neural network applications. The proposed system design can be integrated onto a system-on-a-chip (SoC) platform to develop a smart wearable and automated sleep apnea detection device which is necessary for real-time critical health diagnosis and screening.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9806534/,2022 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC),16-19 May 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

If we refer to etymology, ""metrology"" means ""science of measurement"". The business measurement approach should therefore fall within the realm of rigor and rationality by performing periodic calibration. By using new technologies (IT, Machine learning, etc.), work methods can be innovated by modernizing measurement techniques and by introducing the notion of intelligence. ""SMART Metrology"" or ""intelligent metrology"" is therefore required to take care of the automatic calibration and monitoring of equipment and will provide reliable and repeatable measurements, which will be verified by legal metrology. It is therefore used to create SMART measuring instruments that transform measurement results into controlled information. More and more companies are opting for Smart metrology for the simple reason that it modernizes the techniques of taking measurements introducing new concepts, in particular Big Data. This technology offers metrologists the opportunity to develop their profession, allowing them to actively participate in the compliance of measuring instruments and the reliability of measurements in the company.

'Waste contamination' is a critical issue that affects waste management, and it should be addressed during the garbage collection process. This has led to environmental hazards resulting in health and other social issues. Hence, it is a responsibility of an organization to separate the garbage during the collection process using a suitable technique. In this paper, we are proposing a smart garbage bin kit that automates the separation of garbage collection, which minimizes human error using AI-based technologies. IoT-based devices connected to a smart garbage bin kit guide the user to the correct bin. At the same time, our proposed system can be easily expanded for new special waste categories as well. The other important issue of the current garbage management is improper time management of the garbage removal process in organizations. This happens due to the lack of real-time data on waste bins, and collection is based on the fixed time interval irrespective of the status and location of garbage bins. In the proposed system of SMART Garbage Bin Kit, the group of all interconnected garbage bins is monitored in real-time to identify the optimum collection path considering the location and the status of garbage bins using an optimized algorithm. Hence, the study presented in this paper integrates several intelligent approaches together with IoT based network to build a cutting-edge device, declared as SMART Garbage Bin kit.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities.

The inherent natural variation in performing an activity increases while repeating the same activity for an older adult, let alone the variation introduced when another older adult performs the same activity. Moreover, the challenges in acquiring the labeled data while preserving the privacy, availability of annotators with domain knowledge, aversion towards cameras even for a minimal amount of time for ground truth data collection, and psychological and mental health status make AR for older adults challenging. In this paper, we postulate a self-taught learning-based approach that helps recognize activities with variations that are not being directly seen during the training phase. We hypothesize that the features extracted using deep architectures from unlabeled data instances can learn general underlying representations of activities efficiently and help improve activity classification in a supervised setting, although the data instances in labeled data do not follow the generative distribution of that of unlabeled data. We posit real data from a retirement community center using our in-house SenseBox infrastructure and survey-based assessments concurrently done by a clinical evaluator to study the relationship between activities and functional/behavioral health of older adults.

However, the increased security incidents and leakage of patient data raise the concerns to address security risks and privacy issues of mhealth applications urgently. While recent mobile health applications that rely on password-based authentication cannot withstand password guessing and cracking attacks, several countermeasures such as One-Time Password (OTP), grid-based password, and biometric authentication have recently been implemented to protect mobile health applications. These countermeasures, however, can be thwarted by brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and persistent malware attacks. This paper proposed grid-based honey encryption by hybridising honey encryption with grid-based authentication. Compared to recent honey encryption limited in the hardening password attacks process, the proposed grid-based honey encryption can be further employed against shoulder surfing, smudge and replay attacks.

Nowadays IoT is being used in many fields of Information Technology and general life like in the fields of health, agriculture, weather etc. Due to its advantages it is getting popularity and hence attracting the hackers and attackers for novel attacks. To run the IoT related services interruption free and to save the private data of the network users, the installation of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential step. The efficiency of an IDS depends upon the efficiency of classifier being used inside the IDS for detecting the attacks or intrusion. To become an IDS an efficient IDS, it should not only be efficient in major performance measuring parameters but also it should be as quick as possible to detect the intrusion in the network so that it can detect the attack in real time. To achieve this objective many classifiers have been used for the implementation of IDS. In this work, tree-based ensemble methods are used for checking their performance to identify network attacks in IoT architecture. For this purpose, BoT-IoT dataset, a well-known and publicly available dataset is used for the said purpose. The tree-based ensemble methods used in this work for identifying the attacks in the IoT network are Random Forest, LGBM, Extra Tree, Gradient Boost, XGBoost.

The essential part of this method is based on an adaptive network architecture which utilizes both fuzzy model (FIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) into the framework of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). While battery aging proceeds, the system is capable of delivering accurate power prediction for the typical temperature range. Due to design property of ANN, the network parameters are adapted on-line to the current states (state of charge (SoC), state of health (SoH), temperature). SoC is required as an input parameter to SoAP module and high accuracy is crucial for a reliable self-learning capability. Therefore, a reasonable way to determine the battery state variables is proposed applying a combination of several partly different algorithms. Among others SoC boundary estimation methods, robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) for recalibration of amp hour counters was implemented. ANFIS then achieves the SoAP estimation by means of time forward voltage prognosis (TFVP) before a power pulse.

In contrast, options for re-using existing models seem more limited. Re-use of simulation component models by collaborating organizations is restricted by the same semantic issues however that restrict the inter-organization use of web services. The current representations of web components are predominantly syntactic in nature lacking the fundamental semantic underpinning required to support discovery on the emerging semantic web. Semantic models, in the form of ontology, utilized by web service discovery and deployment architecture provide one approach to support simulation model reuse. Semantic interoperation is achieved through the use of simulation component ontology to identify required components at varying levels of granularity (including both abstract and specialized components). Selected simulation components are loaded into a CSP, modified according to the requirements of the new model and executed. The paper presents the development of ontology, connector software and web service discovery architecture in order to understand how such ontology are created, maintained and subsequently used for simulation model reuse. The ontology is extracted from health service simulation - comprising hospitals and the National Blood Service.

Developed for NASA Ames Research Center, ADTM leverages proven artificial intelligence techniques for rapidly detecting and diagnosing anomalies in near real-time. ADTM combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) as the basis for modeling system behavior with supervised machine learning techniques for localizing detected anomalies. A SOM is a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) that produces a low-dimensional representation of the training samples. Once trained on normal system behavior, SOMs are adept at detecting behavior previously not encountered in the training data. Upon detecting anomalous behavior, ADTM uses a supervised classification approach to determine a subset of measurands that characterize the anomaly. This allows it to localize faults and thereby provide extra insight. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on telemetry data collected from a lab-stationed CubeSat (the “LabSat”) connected to software that gave us the ability to trigger several real hardware faults.

Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system.

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable sensors is an attractive research topic in machine learning and ubiquitous computing over the last few decades, and has extremely practicality in health surveillance, medical assistance, personalized services, etc. However, with the limitation of sensor sampling rate, sustainability, deployment, and other restricted conditions, it is difficult to collect enough and resultful sensor data anywhere, anytime. Therefore, the HAR based on wearable sensors always faces the challenges of the low-data regime under some practical scenarios, which leads to a low accuracy of activity recognition and needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide a powerful method for training resultful generative models that could generate very convincing verisimilar images. The framework of GANs and its variants shed many lights on improving the performance of HAR. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial networks framework called SensoryGANs that can effectively generate available sensor data used for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, SensoryGANs is the first unbroken generative adversarial networks applied in generating sensor data in the HAR research field. Firstly, we tried exploring and devising three activity-special GANs models for three human daily activities. Secondly, these specific models are trained with the guidance of unbroken vanilla GANs. Thirdly, the trained generators from adversarial optimization process are used to generate synthetic sensor data. Finally, the synthetic sensor data from SensoryGANs are used to enrich the original authentic sensor datasets, which can improve the performance of target activity recognition model. Meanwhile, we propose three visual evaluation methods for assessing synthetic sensor data produced by the trained generators in SensoryGANs models.

Many complex health-care problems get suitable solutions with deep learning-based methods, especially for Medicine Combination Prediction (MCP) to patients with complex health conditions. However, existing works either ignore the inter-relationships among medicines or fail to depict these relationships in an integrated and robust deep learning framework. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose SeqMed, a sequence generation model for predicting medicine combination.

10.1109/AIVR.2018.00020,SinkNet: Interactive Sink to Detect Living Habits for Healthcare and Quality of Life Using Private Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"With the development of IoT applications, a wide variety of healthcare systems are available. A decrease in birthrate and an aging population have led to increased importance of health care for older adults. In such environments, a monitoring system is useful, in which a targeted person can be continuously viewed through a camera, and reports regarding the person's health can be automatically transmitted through email. However, the application does not take security into account enough because most systems are connected to the Internet. The system should be protected from a wide variety of risks to keep both personal data and sensors safe. Therefore, we developed SinkNet. This program connects several sensors and constructs a private network that can automatically perform a series of actions for client devices, such as collecting logs, detecting problems through machine learning, and checking to avoid and solve problems. In addition, SinkNet manipulates multiple sensors and recognizes living habits (e.g., hand and face washing, gargling) from the sound of water flow and talks interactively to users through synthetic sounds.

In SkinAid, we propose an application that can not only assist the dermatologist in obtaining a preliminary analysis of detecting, classifying and monitoring the skin lesion but also creates awareness for the user to care for the skin. SkinAid classifies and provides information on several skin lesions. In this regard, the highly unbalanced and limited data leads the existing Deep Learning models to overfit or poorly generalize, resulting in re-duced performance.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0250,Smart autonomous wireless acoustic sensors for aeronautical SHM applications,IEEE,Conferences,"Ultrasound technologies are of great interest for aeronautical structure inspection. Mainly deployed through Phased Array (PA) ultrasonic transducer, ultrasound inspection is currently used as a complementary tool for the local examination of the structure to determine geometry, damage or composition of invisible flaws like cracks, delamination and corrosion. This approach cannot be easily automated since the access to the area of interest often requires to pass through the complex aeronautical structure. Moreover this approach relies on a high degree of human interaction, as the user often decides the spatial inspection sampling according to his intuition and experience of the structure composition and vulnerability. Structure Health Monitoring, namely SHM, overcomes these limitations by enabling rapid, automated, remote, and real-time monitoring of the structure to reduce operational costs and increase lifetime of structures. This inspection strategy gains its strength from the use of a large amount of individual embedded sensors with embedded intelligence (sensing, signal processing, communicating and storing relevant data in non-volatile memories) organized in dense network, a Neural Network. We present in this paper the developments of a novel autonomous wireless acoustic sensor node, including: a flat flexural acoustic sensor capable of working in transmit and receive, a custom vibrational piezoelectric energy harvesting device (PEH) charging a 0.5 Farad buffer supercapacitance through a commercial rectifying IC, an ARM based cortex M3 microprocessor driving digitization, signal processing, data storage and two ways RF communication.

This paper presents a novel implementation of three tools which can be used together to make the analysis and handling of this data easier. The first of these tools is a statistical classifier which automatically assigns labels to the process data. The classifier is trained using historical data containing examples of events of interest, such as recordings taken when maintenance activity or failures have developed. In practice, the labels are used to pre-filter the data, to bring swift attention to events of interest, and to automatically create categorised datasets which can be used to analyse historical performance. Two different types of classifier are presented: a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier and a neural network classifier. The second tool is a simple pattern recognition algorithm which can determine when the different phases of mechanical operation in a single track switch movement occur, for example locking, unlocking, and moving. The final tool is a statistical technique which is used to extract simple features from the data and raise alarms if they indicate poor track switch performance.

In addition to the environmental advantages, cycling aids in improving public health, increasing cycling population and contributing to transit use. With the increasing number of bike-sharing service providers around the world, a real-time demand-supply tracking system which brings together the service providers and bike enthusiasts is implemented. Though there are several bike-sharing applications readily available for the users, currently there are no apps for the bike-sharing owners to track the demand-supply for bikes in real-time for any given station. We implemented a real-time demand-supply system that provides to the bike owner information regarding the demand-supply for bikes in any particular station at any particular time through a dashboard and also does forecasting of the bike demand. The Bike Demand forecasting uses the following classifiers: random forest, gradient boosting and linear regression, to predict the number of bikes in demand at a particular station in real-time. Results from the above-mentioned methods are compared and the method with the best results is chosen to supplement information provided by the dashboard to show the demand. For all three of our datasets, XGBoost on the dataset with all stations outperformed all the other models and hence XGBoost on trips data was chosen for the web application.

In this study, a supervised machine learning-based fall detection was developed using a wearable accelerometer device fitted to the subject's waist. Fifteen volunteers performed a standardized set of movements which were developed by mimicking the scenarios in the FARSEEING Fall Repository, including 10 falling activities and 10 non-falling activities, resulting in a dataset with 900 samples. Supervised Learning is implemented by using two training sets: (1) 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities and (2) 10 real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository added to the 80% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities. Testing is done by using the remaining 20% of the total simulated fall and non-fall activities, remaining five real-world fall signals from the FARSEEING Fall Repository, and actual testing in a simulated environment. Results show that the model with the training data using simulated falls only (Model 1) detected a 10% TPR while the model with real-world fall added (Model 2) detected a 100% TPR when tested using unseen data. Validating using the actual simulated fall and non-falls, Model l resulted in a 93.33% TPR and Model 2 at 96.67%.

Condition indicators are the basic components of diagnosis. It is important to select feature vectors that meet the criteria in order to provide true accuracy and powerful diagnostic routines. Our goal is to indicate the actual system status according to the workload, and use clustering techniques to analyze the workload distribution density to build diagnostic templates. Such templates can be used for system failure forewarning. In the proposed system, we present an approach, based on workload density cluster analysis to automatically monitor the health of software systems and system failure forewarning. Our approach consists of tracking the workload density of metric clusters. We employ the statistical template model to automatically identify significant changes in cluster moving, therefore enabling robust fault detection. We observed two circumstances from the experiment results. First, under most normal status, the lowest accuracy value is approximate our theoretical minimum threshold of 84%. Such result implies a close correlation between our measured and real system status. Second, the command data used by the system could predict 90% of events announced, which reveals the prediction effectiveness of this proposed system.

The side-effect is that the anonymization may lead to useless data to train and test the AI because it is highly dependent on the quality of the data. To overcome this problem, we propose a test-driven anonymization approach for artificial intelligence tools.

The approach has been validated by means of two real-life datasets in the domains of healthcare and health insurance.

This paper explores one such possibility, a conversational agent, able to guide users through an HIV counseling and testing session. Using commercially available software (http://api.ai), an agent was designed and built according to the Center for Disease Control's guidelines for the provision of HIV counseling and testing in a non-clinical setting. The agent was linked to the Telegram chat client (http://telegram.org) and 10 testers were invited to participate in a simulated HIV counseling interaction. Six testers found that talking to the agent felt natural, and equivalent to chatting to a human. Seven said they would feel comfortable taking a real HIV test with the agent. Key concerns with the current agent were the use of overly formal language, the speed at which the agent responded (too fast) and the agent either misunderstanding or not understanding the tester. Positive sentiment towards the agent included the fact that testers felt like the session was more private and anonymous, and avoided the need for them to visit a public health facility and stand in a long queue to get tested.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8253198/,2017 International Conference on the Frontiers and Advances in Data Science (FADS),23-25 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031201,The self- upgrading mobile application for the automatic malaria detection,IEEE,Conferences,"The UN World Health Organization (WHO) set an ambitious vision of malaria control which includes reducing malaria case incidence by 90% by 2030. Many tools and approaches have been considered to enable the progress toward malaria vision. The use of portable smartphones and machine learning (ML) software is a promising one among them. Recently, many ML models have been proposed for malaria detection. From the interview with health workers in the field, we realized ML model should be continuously improved to provide higher accuracy and/or more capability to cover practical issues found in a real setting such as malaria mosquitoes with drug resistance. In this paper, we propose the mobile application for malaria detection which upgrades ML model on its own without depending on internet connection. Unavailability of internet connection is commonly observed in malaria epidemic countries. We also learned that ML model should be not only accurate but also resource-efficient. This motivated us to set up performance metrics for ML model. Based on the metrics, we chose the optimal ML model of Resnet-50. While most of the prior art ML models were optimized in terms of accuracy only, the optimal model of our choice satisfies both accuracy and resource efficiency. With adopting the model, we architect self-upgrading malaria-detection application and it is validated using ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) to ensure the application works in the resource-constrained setting as desired. Lastly, we develop the prototype application and show it diagnoses malaria parasites as expected.

In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time. In our prior work, we proposed a system which solves the problems (1)- (4) to some extent by using user's position data and power consumption data of home electric appliances. In this paper, aiming to solve all the above problems including (5), we propose a new system by extending our prior work.

Although normal operation of battery packs can be simulated in the lab to generate aging data, a variety of other non-operational profiles are typically needed, requiring many hours of testing, often at conditions different than normal operational conditions observed when the battery pack is deployed in its intended application. Moreover, application of prolonged and multiple capacity tests can be detrimental to the health of the battery. In view of these concerns, this article continues a line of research into capacity fade estimation approaches that require less data and time for the data generation process; in particular, an approach using rule based machine learning for Li-ion battery packs is proposed. Using data generated in the laboratory, aging behavior is characterized by measurable features and a supervised learning approach in order to estimate capacity fade using real-time operational data toward the goal of eliminating the need for specific capacity tests.

For Human Activity Recognition, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have shown their capability to provide better performance compared to other machine learning methods. However, ANNs suffer from two major limitations. First, ANNs are often trained using supervised learning requiring labelled databases, which are often difficult to build in real applications. Then, those algorithms are usually very expensive in terms of computing power. For that reason, their integration into low-power microcontrollers has been so far only evaluated to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose to evaluate quantitatively and qualitatively the embedded implementation of different neural networks for human activity recognition. First, supervised learning approaches are presented, followed by an exploratory study of unsupervised learning approaches using Self-Organizing Maps. Finally, some aspects of embedded unsupervised online learning are investigated to improve classification results using subject-specific data over a more general training.

In addition to being able to reflect the body displacement along with the ventricle contraction, the BCG signals also contain multiple sources of interferences, and thus can be used to detect the modes of the body motions. An ensemble machine learning scheme is developed to classify the BCG waveform into several categories, including off-seat, sedate, working and in motion. When an employee is in a sedate position, the BCG samples can be further processed to observe the cardiovascular activities.

Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is a promising approach to design better control policies and has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, most work done in this area used simplified simulation environments of traffic scenarios to train RL-based TSC. To deploy RL in real-world traffic systems, the gap between simplified simulation environments and real-world applications has to be closed. Therefore, we propose LemgoRL, a benchmark tool to train RL agents as TSC in a realistic simulation environment of Lemgo, a medium-sized town in Germany. In addition to the realistic simulation model, LemgoRL encompasses a traffic signal logic unit that ensures compliance with all regulatory and safety requirements. LemgoRL offers the same interface as the well-known OpenAI gym toolkit to enable easy deployment in existing research work.

An application that lacks a strong implementation for anomaly detection is user trait modeling. User trait models expose up-to-date representation of the user so that changes in their interests, their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and interpreted. The reason behind the lack of adoption in user trait modeling arises from the need for a continuous flow of high-volume data, that is not available in most cases, to achieve high-accuracy detection. This paper provides new insight into the anomaly detection techniques through Big Data utilization. With Big Data characteristics, i.e., volume, variety and velocity, anomaly detection techniques have become more suitable tools for user trait modeling. User traits will be modeled by creating a security user profile for each user. This profile is structured and developed to be a source for a strong real-time user authentication method.

According to output of IoT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance.

10.1109/ICEPDS.2018.8571820,Using Robot and Electric Drive in Fall Prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"The global aging phenomenon has motivated active research in human fall injuries. The fall prevention has hence become a popular topic in health informatics. An effective fall prevention paradigm could save millions of people from injury and avoid considerable casualties. Through comparison studies, detail-oriented simulations, and pragmatic field tests, an effective fall prediction method has been developed by authors. The finding is presented in this paper. Three techniques for fall prediction are discussed in this paper. A comparison technique to mimic the traditional stateless fall prediction techniques, along with an algorithm using artificial neural network, was first implemented in authors' previous paper. Then a robotic scheme was developed to simulate human fall by transplanting a proven fall prediction paradigm for humanoid robots with controlled electric drive systems to human subjects. Due to its simulation nature far from the human fall scenarios in reality, the robotic paradigm has obvious limits in real world applications. It was also used more like a reference framework for our last scheme. Eventually we built the third approach that eliminated the above limitation. The third approach is elaborated in this paper. Our test and simulation have proved its pragmatic superiority over other two approaches, along with vast majority of traditional paradigms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8571820/,2018 X International Conference on Electrical Power Drive Systems (ICEPDS),3-6 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/AERO.2015.7119180,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to achieve a robust architecture for future robotic spacecraft,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents a novel failure-tolerant architecture for future robotic spacecraft. It is based on the Time and Space Partitioning (TSP) principle as well as a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and traditional concepts for system failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR). Contrary to classic payload that is separated from the platform, robotic devices attached onto a satellite become an integral part of the spacecraft itself. Hence, the robot needs to be integrated into the overall satellite FDIR concept in order to prevent fatal damage upon hardware or software failure. In addition, complex dexterous manipulators as required for onorbit servicing (OOS) tasks may reach unexpected failure states, where classic FDIR methods reach the edge of their capabilities with respect to successfully detecting and resolving them. Combining, and partly replacing traditional methods with flexible AI approaches aims to yield a control environment that features increased robustness, safety and reliability for space robots. The developed architecture is based on a modular on-board operational framework that features deterministic partition scheduling, an OS abstraction layer and a middleware for standardized inter-component and external communication. The supervisor (SUV) concept is utilized for exception and health management as well as deterministic system control and error management. In addition, a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) approach was implemented yielding a real-time robot sensor confidence analysis and failure detection. The SOM features nonsupervized training given a typical set of defined world states. By compiling a set of reviewable three-dimensional maps, alternative strategies in case of a failure can be found, increasing operational robustness. As demonstrator, a satellite simulator was set up featuring a client satellite that is to be captured by a servicing satellite with a 7-DoF dexterous manipulator. The avionics and robot control were integrated on an embedded, space-qualified Airbus e.Cube on-board computer. The experiments showed that the integration of SOM for robot failure detection positively complemented the capabilities of traditional FDIR methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7119180/,2015 IEEE Aerospace Conference,7-14 March 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ISMAR.2019.00-22,VR Props: An End-to-End Pipeline for Transporting Real Objects Into Virtual and Augmented Environments,IEEE,Conferences,"Improvements in both software and hardware, as well as an increase in consumer suitable equipment, have resulted in great advances in the fields of virtual and augmented reality. Typically, systems use controllers or hand gestures to interact with virtual objects. However, these motions are often unnatural and diminish the immersion of the experience. Moreover, these approaches offer limited tactile feedback. There does not currently exist a platform to bring an arbitrary physical object into the virtual world without additional peripherals or the use of expensive motion capture systems. Such a system could be used for immersive experiences within the entertainment industry as well as being applied to VR or AR training experiences, in the fields of health and engineering. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for creating an interactive virtual prop from rigid and non-rigid physical objects. This includes a novel method for tracking the deformations of rigid and non-rigid objects at interactive rates using a single RGBD camera. We scan our physical object and process the point cloud to produce a triangular mesh. A range of possible deformations can be obtained by using a finite element method simulation and these are reduced to a low dimensional basis using principal component analysis. Machine learning approaches, in particular neural networks, have become key tools in computer vision and have been used on a range of tasks. Moreover, there has been an increased trend in training networks on synthetic data. To this end, we use a convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data, to track the movement and potential deformations of an object in unlabelled RGB images from a single RGBD camera. We demonstrate our results for several objects with different sizes and appearances.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943647/,2019 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR),14-18 Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/CogMI52975.2021.00021,Valence/Arousal Estimation of Occluded Faces from VR Headsets,IEEE,Conferences,"Emotion recognition from facial visual signals is a challenge which has attracted enormous interest over the past two decades. Researchers are attempting to teach computers to better understand a person&#x0027;s emotional state. Providing emotion recognition can massively enrich experiences. The benefits of this research for human-computer interactions are limitless. Emotions are intricate, and so we need a representative model of the full spectrum displayed by humans. A multi-dimensional emotion representation, which includes valence (how positive an emotion) and arousal (how calming or exciting an emotion), is a good fit. Virtual Reality (VR), a fully immersive computer-generated world, has witnessed significant growth over the past years. It has a wide range of applications including in mental health, such as exposure therapy and the self-attachment technique. In this paper, we address the problem of emotion recognition when the user is immersed in VR. Understanding emotions from facial cues is in itself a demanding task. It is made even harder when a head-mounted VR headset is worn, as now an occlusion blocks the upper half of the face. We attempt to overcome this issue by introducing EmoFAN-Vr,a deep neural network architecture, to analyse facial affect in the presence of a severe occlusion from a VR headset with a high level of accuracy. We simulate an occlusion representing a VR headset and apply it to all datasets in this work. EmoFAN-Vrpredicts both discrete and continuous emotions in one step, meaning it can be used in real-time deployment. We fine-tune our network on the AffectNet dataset under VR occlusion and test it on the AFEW-VA dataset, setting a new baseline for this dataset whilst under VR occlusion.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750297/,2021 IEEE Third International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (CogMI),13-15 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ensuring Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) is also an issue due to the harsh nature of sewer environments. As such, research into technologies that allow for automatic unmanned site assessments are of major priority to wastewater managing utilities. The use of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is currently being investigated for it's ability to provide subsurface images. However, the GPR technology has not been tested and validated in harsh sewer environments. It is anticipated that the GPR interpretation can be hindered by low signal to noise ratio. As data driven machine learning techniques have proven to work in higly challenging data, our intenetion is to apply such techniques in GPR data processing. However, this is hindered by the lack of large amount of training data as it is prohibitively hard to collect such real experimental testing data. Thus, the aim of this study is to validate a ground penetrating radar simulation software, gprMax, and test it for suitability in generating realistic, big data sets with which to train the aforementioned data driven machine learning models supplemented with actual sewer crown data.

These factors affect vehicle drivers negatively as they contribute to stress, health problems, and wastefulness of time. This study developed a system called ArRoad that monitors and analyzes vehicle traffic and flooded areas using network of sensors and real-time image processing which then predicts and visualizes possible alternative rerouting paths using machine learning. Water level sensor nodes are used to monitor the flooded areas while real-time video images from cameras are processed to extract the vehicle volume on the streets. A Bayesian Network is generated from the water level sensors and image processing data which provides possible reroute areas to avoid traffic congestion and flooded areas. All data are sent to a cloud platform through the Internet that can be accessed through a mobile user interface. This mobile user application provides information about the condition of the streets and possible reroute maps to users. The accuracy of the system is tested by actual implementation on a specific road. Results showed minimum accessing delay from using the ArRoad to navigate in rerouted paths to prevent impassable roads due to heavy traffic and flood. If effect, it lessens the amount of time experienced by drivers from heavy traffic condition and flooded streets which then improves the quality of life by preventing waste of resources such as time and money.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8229368/,2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE),24-27 Oct. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Through quantitative study, we show that traditional approaches to event detection have difficulty meeting such requirements. Specifically, they cannot explore the detection capability of a deployed system and choose the right sensors, homogeneous or heterogeneous, to meet user specified detection accuracy. They also cannot dynamically adapt the detection capability to runtime observations to save energy. Therefore, we are motivated to propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption.

The benefits of data mining lie in the extraction of new knowledge automatically from the raw data to progress decision making.

These parameters are taken for each sample of water in each ten water stations that selected for the investigations. First two classes were suitable for drinking water while other classes were not, therefore two types of classification techniques ((c4.5) decision trees and artificial neural network, millstone machine learning technique) were suggested to produce a decision concerning the type of pollution and devise proposition for the treatment of pollution. The experiment was carried on a real database validated by (Iraqi Ministry of Environment) gathered from ten authenticated treatment stations. The results show that using C4.5 decision tree classifier found to be the better in terms of the execution time while using NNT algorithm gave slightly better results in terms of the accuracy and error percentages.

10.1109/CCA.2000.897405,Winner take all experts network for sensor validation,IEEE,Conferences,"The validation of sensor measurements has become an integral part of the operation and control of modern industrial equipment. The sensor under a harsh environment must be shown to consistently provide the correct measurements. Analysis of the validation hardware or software should trigger an alarm when the sensor signals deviate appreciably from the correct values. Neural network based models can be used to estimate critical sensor values when neighboring sensor measurements are used as inputs. The discrepancy between the measured and predicted sensor values may then be used as an indicator for sensor health. The proposed winner take all experts (WTAE) network is based on a 'divide and conquer' strategy. It employs a growing fuzzy clustering algorithm to divide a complicated problem into a series of simpler sub-problems and assigns an expert to each of them locally. After the sensor approximation, the outputs from the estimator and the real sensor value are compared both in the time domain and the frequency domain. Three fault indicators are used to provide analytical redundancy to detect the sensor failure. In the decision stage, the intersection of three fuzzy sets accomplishes a decision level fusion, which indicates the confidence level of the sensor health. Two data sets, the Spectra Quest Machinery Fault Simulator data set and the Westland vibration data set, were used in simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed WTAE network.

Supervised machine learning algorithms have become especially successful in many industries including health, legal, security, finance, travel, and others. Training supervised learning algorithms, however, is expensive because the real world contains a very large number of different classes that need to be covered by the training set. This is especially true for the highly variable, multi-user workload data produced by the strategically vital big data and cloud software stacks. It is very important, however, to be able to accurately classify these complex workloads in order to enable autonomic management and optimization. Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is an advanced machine learning approach that enables classification of objects without having to explicitly train on examples of those objects. In this paper we present a new ZSL technique intended to reduce the expense of assembling workload training sets for big data analytic workloads. We demonstrate that multi-user big data workloads can be treated as hybrids of simpler, single-user workload classes, and classified accurately without having to explicitly train on example instances of multi-user workloads. Our technique is able to accurately classify both unseen multi-user workloads, and seen single-user workloads using the same classifier.

Existing approaches for automatic eating detection using wearable sensors often require custom hardware that may not be practical as their usability and energy efficiency have not been validated. In this paper, we propose to use off-the-shelf Bluetooth headsets to unobtrusively monitor and detect users' eating episodes by analyzing the chewing sound. The challenges of using commodity acoustic hardware include the limited sampling rate that reduces feature fidelity and the impact of environment noise in real-world settings. Our experimental results show that the traditional kernel-based approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) could achieve 94-95% classification accuracy in lab settings, though the detection performance quickly degraded to 65-76% for in-the-field testing. We then propose a novel Deep Learning based classification technique that drastically improved detection accuracy to 77-94% despite the existence of ambient noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use Bluetooth headsets to detect eating episodes and to use Deep Learning to significantly increase classification performance in this context.

Early detection in medical imaging is important for promptly treatment or surgery planning. Recently, deep learning methods have been proposed and played a major role in medical image applications. The performance of deep learning model largely depends on the size of training samples. However, the number of samples of patient having urinary stones is limited, and the process of labeling preparation is time-consuming and need experts. In this research, we used a combination of real stone-contained images and synthesized stone-embedded images to train U-Net model to segment urinary stones in abdominal x-ray images. Furthermore, the simple augmentation methods which appear realistic in x-ray images were also implemented in these combined datasets. From the comparative experiments, the proposed method can achieve higher F2 score than U-Net trained with only real images.

Despite various image registration algorithms proposed in the past, large-scale ssEM alignment remains challenging due to the size and complex nature of the data. Recently, the application of unsupervised machine learning in medical image registration has shown promise in efforts to replace an expensive numerical computation process with a once-deployed feed-forward neural network. However, the anisotropy in most ssEM data makes it difficult to directly adopt such learning-based methods for the registration of these images. Here, we propose a novel deformable image registration approach based on weakly supervised learning that can be applied to registering ssEM images at scale.

However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based medical auxiliary diagnosis system, the impact of label noise problems is also increasing. When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, due to ambiguous patient conditions or poor reliability of diagnostic criteria, even clinical experts may lack confidence in making medical diagnoses for some patients. As a result, some samples used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, which adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we study a classification problem of sample labels with random damage. We propose a new hybrid label noise correction model that generalizes many learning problems, including supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. This hybrid model can withstand the negative effects of random noise and various non-random label noise. Extensive experimental results using real-world datasets from UCI machine learning repository are provided, the empirical study shows that our approach successfully improves data quality in many cases, in terms of classification accuracy, over existing label noise correction methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9442246/,2020 IEEE 18th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN),20-23 July 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The primary issue of preventing gastric cancer is to assess its risk level. Most of the current approaches merely contain histological and demographic information for cancer risk assessment. However, the factors of patient-based information, such as family history, diet, high-risk habits and exposure to environmental carcinogens are often not considered in cancer prediction. To address the issue, we present a fully connected neural network method with weighted neighborhood feature (WNF-FCNN) to improve the accuracy of gastric cancer risk prediction based on patient-based information. We first adopt two feature selection schemes to choose weighted neighborhood feature from the 121 raw medical attributes about gastric cancer. Then, a four-layer FCNN is constructed to model the risk level of gastric cancer with Adam optimization algorithm being used to speed up the convergence during training stages. Empirical evaluations on a real hospital cancer medical dataset containing 50,611 records demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach is viable to assess individual gastric cancer risk using patient-based information, with the accuracy rate of 96.2%.

This allows for new opportunities to explore algorithms to interpret body sensor data and provide analytical feedback for learning a physical task, refining body motions, or to protect from work-related injuries. This paper presents a solution to non-invasively equip a person with sensors of a Smart Training System (STS) to improve training efficiency during sport activities. Our system calculates the significance of each body part during physical activities and provides targeted feedback on which body locations are under-performing. In experiments, the system collected data from 13 inertial sensors attached to the entire body of inexperienced golf learners. Using an indoor golf training net with a central target with 3 concentric zones, 1,080 real-world golf swings of 11 participants were analyzed. During the first 30 swings of each participant, the system learned distributions of motions from each sensor, conditioned on swing performance reported by users from their hitting location on the target. In the later 70 swings, feedback was provided to a subgroup of 8 participants, by computing, for an optimal set of features determined during training, the largest discrepancy. The remaining 3 (control) participants received no feedback. From only 100 golf swings for each participant, our system led to significantly improved scores by on average 3.7x (t-test, p <; 0.0001) over the latter 70 swings.

CPS are to meet the needs of the new generation of engineered systems that are highly dependable, efficiently produced and certified, and capable of advanced performance in computation, communication, and control. CPS will transform how we interact with and control the physical world around us, as the Internet transformed how we interact and communicate with one another and revolutionized how and where we access information. One application domain of CPS is Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS), which are life-critical, context-aware, networked systems of medical devices. Medical device industry is undergoing a transformation, embracing the potential of embedded software and network connectivity. Instead of stand-alone devices that can be designed, certified, and used to treat patients independent of each other, distributed systems that simultaneously control multiple aspects of the patient's physiology are increasingly used in hospitals to provide high-quality continuous care for patients. The combination of embedded software controlling medical devices, networking capabilities, and complicated physiological dynamics of patient bodies makes MCPS complex. The need to design complex MCPS that are both safe and effective presents numerous challenges, including achieving high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certification. In this talk, I will discuss these challenges in developing MCPS and present some of our work in addressing them, and several open research and development issues.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6264658/,IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks Workshops (DSN 2012),25-28 June 2012,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Traditional Healthcare System is criticized for some inbuilt flaws like, long term wait time, being expensive, manual payment process, covering the long distance to reach the medical facility and visiting doctors regularly. Smart healthcare systems have all that it requires to replace the traditional healthcare system, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as the ultimate solution for inexpensive round the clock monitoring of patients. In this paper, we have proposed an IoT-based Cardiac Healthcare System for ubiquitous access. The proposed Smart Cardiac Care System promises to give an affordable and accurate solution with real-time observations, with complete privacy of patients and minimum physical examinations by the professionals to Cardiac Units. Multiple physical signs required for a cardiac patient are designed to be sampled at different rates continuously.

10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587406,Large margin pursuit for a Conic Section classifier,IEEE,Conferences,"Learning a discriminant becomes substantially more difficult when the datasets are high-dimensional and the available samples are few. This is often the case in computer vision and medical diagnosis applications. A novel conic section classifier (CSC) was recently introduced in the literature to handle such datasets, wherein each class was represented by a conic section parameterized by its focus, directrix and eccentricity. The discriminant boundary was the locus of all points that are equi-eccentric relative to each class-representative conic section. Simpler boundaries were preferred for the sake of generalizability. In this paper, we improve the performance of the two-class classifier via a large margin pursuit. When formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, the margin computation is demonstrated to be hard, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data. Instead, we present a geometric algorithm to compute the distance of a point to the non-linear discriminant boundary generated by the CSC in the input space. We then introduce a large margin pursuit in the learning phase so as to enhance the generalization capacity of the classifier. We validate the algorithm on real datasets and show favorable classification rates in comparison to many existing state-of-the-art binary classifiers as well as the CSC without margin pursuit.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4587406/,2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,23-28 June 2008,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICCV48922.2021.00303,Large-scale Robust Deep AUC Maximization: A New Surrogate Loss and Empirical Studies on Medical Image Classification,IEEE,Conferences,"Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as the AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii) classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii) classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv) classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets. The proposed method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC (www.libauc.org) whose github address is https://github.com/Optimization-AI/LibAUC.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9710509/,2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV),10-17 Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The high compute resources required by these large networks are alienating the majority of the world population that lives in low-resource settings and lacks the infrastructure to benefit from these advancements in medical AI. Current state-of-the-art medical AI, even with cloud resources, is a bit difficult to deploy in remote areas where we don&#x2019;t have good internet connectivity. We demonstrate a cost-effective approach to deploying medical AI that could be used in limited resource settings using Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We trained and optimized a classification model on the Chest X-ray 14 dataset and a segmentation model on the Nerve ultrasound dataset using INT8 Quantization Aware Training. Thereafter, we compiled the optimized models for Edge TPU execution. We find that the inference performance on edge TPUs is 10x faster compared to other embedded devices. The optimized model is 3x and 12x smaller for the classification and segmentation respectively, compared to the full precision model. In summary, we show the potential of Edge TPUs for two medical AI tasks with faster inference times, which could potentially be used in low-resource settings for medical AI-based diagnostics.

Many existing methods for extracting trees (e.g. vascular or airway trees) from medical images have leveraged appearance priors (e.g. tubular-ness and bifurcationness) and the knowledge of the cross-sectional geometry (e.g. circles or ellipses) of the tree-forming tubes. In this work, we present the first method for 3D tree extraction from 3D medical images (e.g. CT or MRI) that, in addition to appearance and cross-sectional geometry priors, utilizes prior tree statistics collected from the training data. Our tree extraction method collects and leverages topological tree prior and geometrical statistics, including tree hierarchy, branch angle and length statistics. Our implementation takes the form of a Bayesian tree centerline tracking method combining the aforementioned tree priors with observed image data. We evaluated our method on both synthetic 3D datasets and real clinical CT chest datasets. For synthetic data, our method's key feature of incorporating tree priors resulted in at least 13% increase in correctly detected branches under different noise levels. For real clinical scans, the mean distance from ground truth centerlines to the detected centerlines by our method was improved by 12% when utilizing tree priors. Both experiments validate that, by incorporating tree statistics, our tree extraction method becomes more robust to noise and provides more accurate branch localization.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8287685/,2017 14th Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV),16-19 May 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An efficient way of dealing with these data is by storing them in list-mode (LM). To reconstruct the data, maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) is efficiently applied to the list-mode data, resulting in the list-mode maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (LMMLEM) reconstruction algorithm. In this work, we consider a PET system consisting of two thick detectors facing each other. PMT outputs are collected for each coincidence event and are used to perform 3D maximum-likelihood (ML) position estimation of location of interaction. The mathematical properties of the ML estimation allow accurate modeling of the detector blur and provide a theoretical framework for the subsequent estimation step, namely the LMM-LEM reconstruction. Indeed, a rigorous statistical model for the detector output can be obtained from calibration data and used in the calculation of the conditional probability density functions for the interaction location estimates. Our implementation of the 3D ML position estimation takes advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware and permits accurate real-time estimates of position of interaction.

In this scenario it is important to note that several graph searching algorithms that were proposed to give exhaustive searches doesn't provide the most satisfying outcome in terms of asymptotic time complexity.

10.1109/ICOSST53930.2021.9683838,MRI Based Glioma Detection and Classification into Low-grade and High-Grade Gliomas,IEEE,Conferences,"Brain tumors are one of the most rapidly spreading types of tumors known to humans. The worst and most dangerous type of tumor is a brain tumor. However, if diagnosed early, patients with brain tumors have a higher chance of survival acknowledgments to simple and inexpensive treatments. Expert radiologists, equipment, and biopsies are used in the traditional method of diagnosing a brain tumor. Machine learning has proved to deliver cutting-edge methods for early identification of brain tumors with better accuracies, avoiding costly diagnoses and unnecessary biopsies and assisting radiologists. Using a machine learning approach, this study proposes a technique for brain tumor classification and segmentation as HGG and LGG (High-Grade Glioma &#x0026; Low-Grade Glioma). One of the most inflexible and innovative challenges confronting artificial intelligence approaches is medical diagnostics utilizing image processing and machine learning. The project involves the preprocessing, edge detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of MRI brain images. The preprocessing is implemented by using median filter and canny edge detection is adapted in edge detection stage to inspect the best performing edge detector in terms of accuracy. Then, the MR image is segmented by K-means clustering technique. However, some of the important features are extracted including GLCM features for texture identification. Finally, in the classification phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers are used. After using these classifiers, we distinguished the tumors as HGG or LGG. To determine whether an MRI image of the brain has a tumor and to classify as HGG or LGG, a machine learning methodology is applied. The aim is to develop a system with better tumor detection from MRI images to be used as a tool in real time by employing machine learning approach. The proposed method is validated using the MATLAB environment on the available BRATS 2019 dataset.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It has thus become essential to understand the nature and the weight of the factors that influence it and to foresee its future changes in order to ensure good governance, improve hospital management of material and financial resources and therefore be ready to face emergency situations such as the ongoing global pandemic. Using Python programming language, different supervised machine learning algorithms, were tested on a dataset extracted from digital medical records of hospitalized patients in the infectious diseases department at Sfax university hospital (Tunisia). Different models for predicting the hospitalization cost of a patient upon admission were created and evaluated after having processed and analyzed the collected data. This dataset initially comprised 542 observations and 136 variables including 36 quantitative ones and 100 dummy variables. Two variable selection methods were applied and subgroups of independent variables with different semantic meanings were also used. Despite few shortcomings such as missing data, the most precise of the different tested prediction models was that of 15th degree multiple linear regression. Regressors were the season of the period of hospitalization, suspected diagnosis and patient characteristics such as gender. When applied in reality, this tool would make it possible to predict the hospitalization cost and therefore forecast precise budgets.

The performance of medical image recognition models highly depends on the representativeness and sufficiency of training samples. The high expense of collecting large amounts of practical medical images leads to a demand of synthesizing image samples. In this research, generative adversarial networks (GANs), which consist of a generative network and a discriminative network, are applied to develop a medical image synthesis model. Specifically, deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), and boundary equilibrium GANs (BEGANs) are implemented and compared to synthesize medical images in this research. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied in the GAN models, which can capture feature representations that describe a high level of image semantic information. Then synthetic images are generated by employing the generative network mapping from random noise. The effectiveness of the generative network is validated by a discriminative network, which is trained to detect the synthetic images from real images. Through a minimax two-player game, the generative and discriminative networks can train each other. The generated synthetic images are used to train a CNN classification model for tissue recognition.

Diagnosing the skin lesion is the first step towards its treatment. In this work we have assimilated two approaches on the pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks on the ImageNet dataset. Firstly, we use the transfer learning approach without any fine tuning and obtained features are fed for linear classification task. Secondly, we use the transfer learning approach with fine tuning.

These techniques are mostly implemented at the application layer and make simplistic assumptions about the system resources communication and they are often unconvinced to the co-design in embedded system SoC and MPSoC. Moreover, they often assume that the data codec video characteristics and their processing needs are stationary, which is not true in practice especially in hardware for the real target FPGA. In fact, data streams in codec video are highly dynamic and may also experience concept drift, thereby requiring continuous online adaptation of the throughput and quality to each processing task in video and frame. Hence, existing solutions for multimedia and telecommunication applications are often too conservative or too aggressive, especially in video codec. To address these limitations, complexity in video test, quality of frame, precision, send video with a fast time especially in medical applications, airport and military flight problems. we propose offline algorithm scheduling which minimize the execution time (i.e., troughput and output quality of video and frame) of medical and military applications under real time and resources constraints. Our algorithm scheduling uses offline and online reinforcement learning techniques. Moreover, our scheduler is able to detect concept drifts and to smoothly adapt the scheduling strategy (DAG algorithm). Our experiments realized on a chain of tasks modeling real-life streaming application demonstrate that our scheduler is able to learn the scheduling policy and to adapt it such that it minimizes the execution time and optimize the precision, quality of frame as the video codec characteristics are dynamically changing. The strategy of scheduling algorithm is to order the tasks in processor or different processors.

10.1109/ACITT.2019.8780078,Modern Hardware and Software Solution for Identification of Abnormal Neurological Movements of Patients with Essential Tremor,IEEE,Conferences,"Because of the real physical movements, associated with tremor, which is very small rapid fluctuations that vary greatly in amplitude and frequency, reliable measurements of motion characteristics and the interpretation of the results of such measurements are important for the diagnosis of diseases. Increasing of amplitude and changing the frequency and form of oscillation in relation to the norm (frequency and amplitude of physiological tremor) are signs of disturbance of central and peripheral neural mechanisms of regulation of movements. Program analysis of these parameters is important for understanding the role of dysfunction of individual structures of the brain in the processes of motion management, and for the clinic in the aspects of early detection, more accurate diagnosis of motor disorders, the choice and correction of optimal treatment methods associated with the selection of effective therapy. The analysis of tremor forms has great importance in neurological practice, in particular, in the diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome. Computerized analysis methods are extremely accurate and effective in assessing the degree of tremor of patients. Mathematical modeling allows obtaining frequency characteristics, amplitude of oscillation, deviation from normal state, etc. Development of mathematical models and methods, means of identification greatly facilitate the work with patients; make it possible to assess the degree of disease with a single and objective side.

Telepresence robotics is a solution through which courses and laboratories can be held remotely where medical students can interact physically, through robots, with teaching or laboratory equipment, thus actively participating in the educational process.

Consequently, it is necessary to adopt a regular screen to reduce brain damage and other complications. For one thing, the risk factors screened can be divided into 6 subsets: medical history, family history, fasting blood, lifestyle, physical characteristics, and demographic information. For another, the screen results can be categorized into 5 groups: normal carotid plaque, thickening, unstable plaque, and arterial stenosis. To address the above problems, Multi-View Multi-Label (MVML) learning provides a fundamental framework for handling such tasks, which treats the risk factors as multi-view data and the screen results as multi-label data. Besides, it is a challenging issue of how to effectively utilize view correlations and label correlations in MVML learning. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Multi-label Learning with Dual-Attention Networks (MML-DAN) for stroke screen, which can strike a balance between label-specific views and label correlations. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism aims to focus on the most pertinent information of the corresponding labels rather than using all available risk factors equally. Experiments on one real-world dataset of stroke screen demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MML-DAN for stroke screen prediction. To further validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of MML-DAN, extensive experiments on 5 benchmark MVML datasets show that MML-DAN significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art MVML algorithms.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9313285/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM),16-19 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268650,Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Supervised Machine Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can be used as a non invasive medical diagnostic method when used in combination with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described.

10.1109/CVPR.2014.352,Multivariate General Linear Models (MGLM) on Riemannian Manifolds with Applications to Statistical Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Images,IEEE,Conferences,"Linear regression is a parametric model which is ubiquitous in scientific analysis. The classical setup where the observations and responses, i.e., (xi, yi) pairs, are Euclidean is well studied. The setting where yi is manifold valued is a topic of much interest, motivated by applications in shape analysis, topic modeling, and medical imaging. Recent work gives strategies for max-margin classifiers, principal components analysis, and dictionary learning on certain types of manifolds. For parametric regression specifically, results within the last year provide mechanisms to regress one real-valued parameter, xi ∈ R, against a manifold-valued variable, yi ∈ M. We seek to substantially extend the operating range of such methods by deriving schemes for multivariate multiple linear regression -- a manifold-valued dependent variable against multiple independent variables, i.e., f: ℝn → M. Our variational algorithm efficiently solves for multiple geodesic bases on the manifold concurrently via gradient updates. This allows us to answer questions such as: what is the relationship of the measurement at voxel y to disease when conditioned on age and gender. We show applications to statistical analysis of diffusion weighted images, which give rise to regression tasks on the manifold GL(n)/O(n) for diffusion tensor images (DTI) and the Hilbert unit sphere for orientation distribution functions (ODF) from high angular resolution acquisition.

In vitro, ambient pressures were varied (between 0 and 120 mmHg) in a closed-loop flow system circulating 0.2 ml Sonazoid microbubbles (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) suspended in 750 ml of isotonic diluent and recorded by a Millar pressure catheter as the reference standard. Simultaneously, a SonixRP ultrasound scanner (Ultrasonix Medical Corp., Richmond, BC, Canada) operating in pulse inversion mode (ftransmit: 2.5 MHz) was used to acquire unprocessed RF data at five different incident acoustic pressures (from 76 kPa to 897 kPa; n=3). The subharmonic data for each pulse was extracted using band-pass filtering with averaging, and subsequently, processed to eliminate noise. The incident acoustic pressure most sensitive to ambient pressure fluctuations was determined; then the ambient pressure was tracked over 20 seconds. Regression analysis compared subharmonic and catheter pressure values. In vivo validation of this technique was performed noninvasively for tracking left ventricular (LV) pressures of two canines using similar post processing as in vitro. The subharmonic signal tracked ambient pressures with r2 = 0.922 for 20 seconds in vitro. In vivo the subharmonic signal tracked the LV pressures with r2 >; 0.7P90.

Furthermore, we propose a post-processing approach to refine the network landmark output, by averaging the candidate landmarks. Owing to these settings, the proposed framework is fast and accurate. For 3D cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images with size 224×224×64, our framework runs ~128 volumes per second (VPS) on GPU and achieves 6.75mm average point-to-point distance error for landmark location, which outperforms both state-of-the-art and baseline methods. We also show that segmenting the 3D image cropped with the bounding box results in both improved performance and efficiency.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9412087/,2020 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),10-15 Jan. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Pathological diagnoses are sensitive to many external factors and is known to be subjective. Only systems that can meet strict requirements in pathology would be able to run along pathological routines and eventually digitized the area, and the developed platform should comply with existing pathological routines and international standards. Currently, there are a number of available software tools which can perform histopathological tasks including virtual slide viewing, annotating, and basic image analysis, however, none of them can serve as a digital platform for pathology. Here we describe OpenHI2, an enhanced version Open Histopathological Image platform which is capable of supporting all basic pathological tasks and file formats; ready to be deployed in medical institutions on a standard server environment or cloud computing infrastructure. In this paper, we also describe the development decisions for the platform and propose solutions to overcome technical challenges including responsive region retrieval and viewing, virtual slide magnification, recording of diagnostic areas. These factors would promote OpenHI2 be used as a platform for histopathological images in real-world clinical settings. Furthermore, in research, OpenHI2 inherited the annotation functionality from the previous version, thus acquired annotations can be directly utilized by the newly added machine learning module which include popular machine learning models to perform tasks such as histology image classification and segmentation in the same environment.

10.1109/ICIECA.2005.1644370,Optimal approach for enhancement of large and small scale near-infrared and infrared imaging,IEEE,Conferences,"In a broad area of industry such as remote sensing and medical diagnosing, imaging enhancement technology takes a leading role, where energy distribution of the light source depends not only on image coordinate but also on wavelength. Both infrared (IR) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging techniques have a variety of applications in these fields. For instance, satellite images are taken via IR or NIR spectrometer and laser Doppler medical scanning is collaborated with NIR spectrometer. Matrix functions of any image correspond to brightness or energy at each image pixel. The actual decision making must rely on detailed investigation of images being obtained. Therefore, image processing should be taken into account so as to enhance the results from real world. Segmentation is an image analysis approach to clarify feature ambiguity and information noise, which divides an image into separate parts that correlate with the objects or areas of the particular object involved. This procedure can be conducted by clustering, which is a process of partitioning a set of pattern vectors into subsets. Being a simple unsupervised learning algorithm, k-means clustering algorithm has the potential to both simplify the computation and accelerate the convergence. In most cases optimization is closely related to clustering, which gives rise to the best way of problem solving. In this article, optimal approach is proposed to be implemented along with image segmentation. This methodology is to enhance both large scale and small scale IR and NIR image processing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1644370/,2005 International Conference on Industrial Electronics and Control Applications,29 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Current technological advances have allowed virtual reality application to leave their mark in the medical sector by the use of different training simulators and applications that help the doctors experience from simulating a variety of surgeries. In this paper we present the effects of Virtual Reality immersion on patients that suffer mild to medium pain, as well as our knowledge in the implementation of a virtual reality application that can achieve a positive effect on this serious issue.

The system operates on images using the method of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Suspicious breast lesions are automatically marked with colours, thus directing the physician's attention towards the critical regions. A proper and careful decision procedure is needed to differentiate between increases of signal intensity triggered by noise and tissue dislocations (motion artifacts) and increases that are triggered by an accumulation of contrast agent in the related breast region. We present our component for image matching using self organising maps (SOM), which enables the system to work properly even with image sequences that are strongly deformed by the patients breathing movements. To reach the time constraint of 15 minutes in medical practice we decide to implement a parallel architecture for the neural network matcher, which works on all computers in the heterogeneous network of our medical partners.

Inherent to the efficacy of deep brain stimulation is the acquisition of an optimal parameter configuration. Using conventional methods, the optimization process for tuning the deep brain stimulation system parameters can intrinsically induce strain on clinical resources. An advanced means of quantifying Parkinson's hand tremor and distinguishing between parameter settings would be highly beneficial. The conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system, such as the BioStamp nPoint, has a volumetric profile on the order of a bandage that readily enables convenient quantification of Parkinson's disease hand tremor. Furthermore, the BioStamp nPoint has been certified by the FDA as a 510(k) medical device for acquisition of medical grade data. Parametric variation of the amplitude parameter for deep brain stimulation can be quantified through the BioStamp nPoint conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor system mounted to the dorsum of the hand. The acquired inertial sensor signal data can be wirelessly transmitted to a secure Cloud computing environment for post-processing. The quantified inertial sensor data for the parametric study of the effects of varying amplitude can be distinguished through machine learning classification. Software automation through Python can consolidate the inertial sensor data into a suitable feature set format. Using the multilayer perceptron neural network considerable machine learning classification accuracy is attained to distinguish multiple parametric settings of amplitude for deep brain stimulation, such as 4.0 mA, 2.5 mA, 1.0 mA, and `Off' status representing a baseline.

In this investigation, with primarily studies analysis of the performance metric characteristics we have developed a graphic user interface application to perform the diagnostic of pathology on Parkinson&#x2019;s disease (PD) based on the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier. The system is implemented and simulated in Anaconda, and its performance is tested on real dataset that contains 22 features, with the total of 195 instances and two (02) classes. Each class, an abnormal class (patients having PD) and a normal class (healthy patients) consists of 48 instances, and 147 instances, respectively. The simulation results achieved better training accuracy, slightly higher than the test accuracy in the range of [75.7%~100%] and [75.0%~92.3%], respectively. The prediction performance of the class status maybe optimized by combining the dataset set size with the k-neighbors parameters. It can be improved by adjusting k and the size in the range of [2~9], and [15%~35%], which results in increasing the interval of the accuracy in the range of [86.7~100] % for the training set and [86.4~91,8] % for the test set. The proposed method shows the effectiveness of identifying a normal and an abnormal class status from the statistical proprieties of the Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals. For quality analysis, the present technique can serve as a test platform for measurement and verification of the pathology disease. it can be used as a guideline to examine the performance metrics that tells us how much better the proposed model is than making prediction.

The method is validated by the proposed planar 3D res-u-net network with encoder transferred from the 2D VGG-16, which is applied for a single-stage unbalanced 3D image data segmentation. In particular, we evaluate the method on the MICCAI 2016 MS lesion segmentation challenge dataset utilizing solely fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence without brain extraction for training and inference to simulate real medical praxis. The planar 3D res-u-net network performed the best both in sensitivity and Dice score amongst end to end methods processing raw MRI scans and achieved comparable Dice score to a state-of-the-art unimodal not end to end approach. Complete source code was released under the open-source license, and this paper complies with the Machine learning reproducibility checklist. By implementing practical transfer learning for 3D data representation, we could segment heavily unbalanced data without selective sampling and achieved more reliable results using less training data in a single modality. From a medical perspective, the unimodal approach gives an advantage in real praxis as it does not require co-registration nor additional scanning time during an examination.

While single-label classification problems have been thoroughly researched, the same cannot be said for MLC. A gradually increasing number of problems are now being tackled as multi-label, allowing for richer and more accurate knowledge mining in real-world domains, such as medical diagnoses, social media, text classification, etc. Currently, there are two ways of solving MLC problems; Problem Transformation Approach and Algorithm Adaptation Method. Of the two, the former has in its domain Classifier Chains (CC) which is the most effective and popular method of solving MLC problems because of its simplicity in implementation. Unfortunately, CC is not favoured due to 2 drawbacks, [1] ordering of the labels for classification are randomly decided without a fixed logic or algorithm to it which results in varying accuracy, [2] all the labels, even those which may be redundant for a particular dataset are put into the chain despite the probability that some may be carrying irrelevant details.

However, the deployment of HAR in real-world scenarios is limited by some major challenges. Among those issues, privacy is particularly relevant, since activity patterns may reveal sensitive information about the users (e.g., personal habits, medical conditions). HAR solutions based on Federated Learning (FL) have been recently proposed to mitigate this problem. In FL, each user shares with a cloud server only the parameters of a locally trained model, while personal data are kept private. The cloud server is in charge of building a global model by aggregating the received parameters. Even though FL avoids the release of labelled sensor data, researchers have found that the parameters of deep learning models may still reveal sensitive information through specifically designed attacks. In this paper, we propose a first contribution in this line of research by introducing a novel framework to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for FL-based HAR.

10.1109/ICMLA.2015.196,Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Belief Networks for Prognosis of Breast Cancer,IEEE,Conferences,"We propose a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) for prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer. PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes.

10.1109/ISSRE52982.2021.00055,PyGuard: Finding and Understanding Vulnerabilities in Python Virtual Machines,IEEE,Conferences,"Python has become one of the most popular pro-gramming languages in the era of data science and machine learning, and is also widely deployed in safety-critical fields like medical treatment, autonomous driving systems, etc. However, as the official and most widely used Python virtual machine, CPython, is implemented using C language, existing research has shown that the native code in CPython is highly vulnerable, thus defeats Python&#x0027;s guarantee of safety and security. This paper presents the design and implementation of PyGuard, a novel software prototype to find and understand real-world security vulnerabilities in the CPython virtual machines. With PyGuard, we carried out an empirical study of 10 different versions of CPython virtual machines (from version 3.0 to the latest 3.9). By scanning a total of 3,358,391 lines native code, we have identified 598 new vulnerabilities. Based on our study, we describe a taxonomy to classify vulnerabilities in CPython virtual machines. Our taxonomy provides a guidance to construct automated and accurate bug-finding tools. We also suggest systematic remedies that can mediate the threats posed by these vulnerabilities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9700331/,2021 IEEE 32nd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),25-28 Oct. 2021,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.172,Querying Large and Expressive Biomedical Ontologies,IEEE,Conferences,"Real-world biomedical ontologies like the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) are often of large size and can fall in the category of OWL 2 Full. Meta-modeling is commonly adopted in the FMA with most of its classes and roles also specified as individuals, leading to undecidability in reasoning. The state-of-the-art reasoning and querying systems like Pellet often ignore the essence of such meta-modeling. In this paper we present a novel, effective approach to querying large and expressive medical ontologies. More precisely, a sub-language of OWL 2 Full is defined, denoted as Hi(SRIQ), to extend the DL language SRIQ with meta-modeling so that one name can be used as class, role and individual at the same time. We give an algorithm to construct multiple SRIQ knowledge bases from a Hi(SRIQ) ontology so that its reasoning and querying tasks can be reduced to be performed in these SRIQs in an independent way. Moreover, a meta-query language is designed to allow for variables present at class/role positions in query. Answering meta-query in constructed SRIQs is transformed into evaluating a group of conjunctive queries over single SRIQ through query partitioning and heuristic materialization of class/role variables in query. As a result, the Hi(SRIQ) version of the FMA yields eight SRIQs and an empirical study shows that our approach outperforms Pellet in query answering. Our work demonstrates that through divide-and-conquer large and expressive ontologies can be queried in both sound and practical way.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336206/,"2015 IEEE 17th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2015 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security, and 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems",24-26 Aug. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

On-line Holter monitors need reliable and quick algorithms to perform all the necessary signal processing tasks. This paper presents the methods that were conceptualized and implemented at the development of such a monitoring system at Medical Clinic No. 4 of Targu-Mures. The system performs the following ECG signal processing steps: (1) Decomposition of the ECG signals using multi-resolution wavelet transform, which also eliminates most of the high and low frequency noises. These components will serve as input for wave classification algorithms; (2) Identification of QRS complexes, P and T waves using two different algorithms: a sequential clustering and a neural-network-based classification. This latter also distinguishes normal R waves from abnormal cases; (3) Localization of several kinds of arrhythmia using a spectral method. An autoregressive model is applied to estimate the series of R-R intervals. The coefficients of the AR model are predicted using the Kalman filter, and these coefficients will determine a local spectrum for each QRS complex. By analyzing this spectrum, different arrhythmia cases are identified. The algorithms were tested using the MIT-BIH signal database and own multichannel ECG registrations.

A common approach consists in assessing the network robustness, i.e., its ability to correctly classify input data that is particularly challenging for classification. We recently proposed a robustness definition that considers input data degraded by alterations that may occur in reality; the approach was originally devised for image classification in the medical domain. In this paper, we extend the definition of robustness to any type of input for which some alterations can be defined. Then, we present ROBY, a tool for ROBustness analYsis of ANNs. The tool accepts different types of data (images, sounds, text, etc.) stored either locally or on Google Drive. The user can use some alterations provided by the tool, or define their own.

Authentication by gait identifies a person with his/her unique walking pattern. Gait has the advantage of being unobtrusive compared to other biometrics. Gait authentication is important in various security, medical- and sports-based applications. This paper mainly analyses gait features depending on acceleration sensors of smartphones and proposes a new gait authentication method based on the late fusion technique. By using Deep Hybrid Network (DHN), we develop an effective model for real-time authentication of users. DHN is a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), long short term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent unit (GRU), which are sequentially added to the model, and their features are combined to make a final decision by a softmax layer. The combination of networks is made by spreading the input features and changing the neural network's initial weights.

Research is also ongoing into how to improve the lives of ordinary citizens using robotic arms. Often, it is difficult for physically impaired individuals to complete tasks such as obtaining an object from a shelf, opening a refrigerator door, obtaining food or drink from the refrigerator, and picking a needed item from a drawer. Thus, they must rely on a caregiver to aid them with such tasks or complete these tasks for them. In such cases, a robotic arm could potentially be used to assist the visually impaired individual to pick up items. Prior work has described a system that takes in audio commands from an individual, applies natural language processing to identify the action required by the user, and combines this with object recognition and grasp detection to identify the object in the fridge. However, the limitation in that work was the different components were not integrated and there were inefficiencies in the process of grasp point detection from images.This work builds on existing research by integrating the object recognition and grasp detection components. The work describes a technique to dynamically adjust the size of the object image sent to the grasp point detection module by extracting only the portion necessary for grasp detection from the stream of camera images. This approach of separately performing the object recognition, identifying the portion of the object suitable for grasping (i.e., the handle), and dynamically determining the buffer zone around the handle for use in the grasp detection module reduces the amount of data transmitted between steps and enables real-time object recognition and grasp identification.

The sooner these diseases are detected, the better the patient's recovery. But colonoscopy is a demanding process, often leads to the high rate of misdiagnosis by experts, professional physicians and nurses and costs a lot of time. Therefore, robot-assisted colonoscopy is considered as an important method to solve this problem. In recent years, many automated deep learning models for colonoscopy have been proposed. However, these models are usually large and time-consuming, and cannot meet actual needs. Besides, due to the disconnection of data between hospitals, the strength of medical resources between different departments in different hospitals is different, so the general multi-classification model cannot fit the characteristics of such data distribution. Therefore, in this article, we ensemble multiple binary classification models (each model detects one disease) and extracted a compression model using knowledge distillation technology, which can simultaneously detect polyps, Merkel diverticula, ulcers and bleeding from colonoscopy.

First, we have done extensive research on the medical care situation and the hospitals' problems in China and conclude that reducing the triage pressure is of great importance for hospitals. We then collect the medical Question Answering datasets, including questions and answers with symptom tags. According to the form of our data, we use BERT, a mainstream model in Natural Language Processing, as the base of our system and modify it with additional components specified to our task. We developed two models based on different datasets. One is trained by data from the five most frequent symptom tags. And for the other one, we use the whole dataset by identifying the appearance of special words, measuring the overlap of all the tags, and merging them into 20 categories. Both of them utilize several training techniques and result in relatively high accuracy: top1 85% accuracy and top2 accuracy 96% on the smaller dataset, top1 accuracy 66.2%, and top2 accuracy 78.3% on the other one. Then we analyze the results and build up our web system for medical use. If given real-world data with similar data distribution, our system could help patients judge diseases and alleviate the triage problem in medical treatment to a certain extent.

The biggest challenge facing majority of patients is the fact that there is still a lack of communication with healthcare professionals. Smart home (out-of hospital care) can raise personal self-sufficiency in association with living independently for longer as this disease is considered life-long condition.

In this paper, we propose a robustness definition for neural networks used for regression, by tackling some of the problems of existing robustness definitions. First of all, by following recent works done for classification problems, we propose to define the robustness of networks used for regression w.r.t. alterations of their input data that can happen in reality. Since different alteration levels are not always equally probable, the robustness definition is parameterized with the probability distribution of the alterations. The error done by this type of networks is quantifiable as the difference between the estimated value and the expected value; since not all the errors are equally critical, the robustness definition is also parameterized with a &#x201C;tolerance&#x201D; function that specifies how the error is tolerated. The current work has been motivated by the collaboration with the industrial partner that has implemented a medical sensor employing a Multilayer Perceptron for the estimation of the blood oxygen pressure.

Although this endeavor is well-established, existing solutions are typically restricted to lab or hospital conditions because they operate on recordings from a set of EEG electrodes that covers the whole head. By contrast, a true breakthrough for these applications would be the deployment `in the real world', by means of wearable devices that encompass just one (or a few) channels. Such a reduction of the available information inevitably makes the classification task more challenging. We tackle this issue by means of a multilinear subspace learning step (using data from multiple channels during training) and subsequently solving a regression problem with a low-rank structure to classify new trials (using data from only a single channel during testing).

These Trojans lead to un-desired change in functionality of the design and provide easy access to sensitive information. Trojans attacks or malicious activities are triggered based on very rare conditions, which can evade test-time Trojan detection but can arise during long hours of field operation. In this paper we propose a run-time Trojan detection architecture for a custom many-core based on Machine Learning technique. We exploit Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised machine learning algorithms. The Data-set is generated based on many-core router behavior under normal and Trojan triggered settings. The paper targets different communication attacks triggered by Hardware Trojans, namely core address spoofing, traffic diversion, route looping attack. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm has detection accuracy in the range of 94% to 97%.We implemented a framework for many-core architecture with SVM kernel while triggering Trojans based on two different conditions.

However, in practical deployment scenarios, many such methods are sensitive to the outliers present in the imperfectly-curated training sets. Current robust methods use heuristics for model fitting or lack formulations to leverage even a small amount of high-quality expert feedback. In contrast, we propose a novel method combining (i) robust statistical modeling, extending the multivariate generalized-Gaussian to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, with (ii) semi-supervised learning to leverage a small expert-labeled outlier set.

10.1109/CINTI.2011.6108484,Spectral feature extraction and characterization via simple linear and nonlinear technology integration,IEEE,Conferences,"A systematic approach for spectral calibration, extraction and characterization is presented. It involves the simple technology integration of the linear and nonlinear methodologies. Raman spectra are essentially weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, while the background spectra (e.g., fluorescence spectra) act as another primary intensity component in the raw Raman spectrograph. Thus the calibrated Raman spectra from measurements are subject to detrend and denoising so as to extract the intrinsic spectra, which contain solely the unique spectral signatures of the individual biomedical samples. By removing the slowly varying baseline background spectra and rapidly varying noises, intrinsic Raman spectra could be extracted using a combination of linear and nonlinear methodologies. The goal is to capture the distinguishable wave number information on the Raman shift for feature identification. This approach is crucial for spectra analysis to associate Raman spectra with the medical diagnosis. Considering the slowly varying nature of background spectra such as fluorescence, linear least squares estimation is applied to detrend the background spectra from the measured spectra being calibrated. Since most noises are rapidly varying, nonlinear discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising is applied to separate the intrinsic Raman spectra from noises for spectral identification. This approach is proposed so as to differentiate the normal spectra from the abnormal spectra of the fresh mice lung samples. Numerical simulation outcomes include the calibrated Raman spectra, detrended spectra free of background effects and the extracted intrinsic spectra after nonlinear DWT denoising. The satisfactory results indicate that the proposed simple linear and nonlinear technology integration provides a useful approach for biomedical sample characterization. In addition, it reduces computational complexity compared with artificial intelligence approaches, which has no technical difficulty in real time medical diagnosis implementation. This serves as a fundamental step for further data clustering and accurate decision making among numerous diverse samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108484/,2011 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI),21-22 Nov. 2011,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

So far, automated Computer-Aided Diagnostic tools were not widely applied to ultrasound imaging. The emerging methods in Artificial Intelligence, namely deep learning, gave rise to new applications in medical imaging modalities. The work's objective was to show the feasibility of implementing deep learning algorithms directly on a research scanner with GPU software beamforming. We have implemented and evaluated two deep neural network architectures as part of the signal processing pipeline on the ultrasound research platform USPlatform (us4us Ltd., Poland). The USPlatform is equipped with a GPU cluster, enabling full software-based channel data processing as well as the integration of open source Deep Learning frameworks. The first neural model (S-4-2) is a classical convolutional network for one-class classification of baby body parts. We propose a simple 6-layer network for this task. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 786 ultrasound images of a fetal training phantom. The second model (Gu-net) is a fully convolutional neural network for brachial plexus localisation. The model uses `U-net'-like architecture to compute the overall probability of target detection and the probability mask of possible target locations. The model was trained and evaluated on 5640 ultrasound B-mode frames. Both training and inference were performed on a multi-GPU (Nvidia Titan X) cluster integrated with the platform. As performance metrics we used: accuracy as a percentage of correct answers in classification, dice coefficient for object detection, and mean and std. dev. of a model's response time. The `S-4-2' model achieved 96% classification accuracy and a response time of 3 ms (334 predictions/s). This simple model makes accurate predictions in a short time. The `Gu-net' model achieved a 0.64 dice coefficient for object detection and a 76% target's presence classification accuracy with a response time of 15 ms (65 predictions/s).

These knowledge bases are presented in form accepted in the medical literature and contain descriptions of diseases (from specified therapeutic areas) as well as an explanation of these knowledge bases based on descriptions of clinical histories from used training sets. The formal representation of medical knowledge bases enables their usage for intelligent systems for medical diagnostics.,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7397277/,2015 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS),12-14 Dec. 2015,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ICDMW.2009.29,Theoretical Study of the Relationship between Diversity and Single-Class Measures for Class Imbalance Learning,IEEE,Conferences,"This paper presents the theoretical research about the relationship between diversity of classification ensembles and single-class measures that are commonly used in class imbalance learning. Although there have been studies on diversity and its links to overall ensemble accuracy, little work has been done on the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures in class imbalance learning. The study of class imbalance learning is important, because many real-world problems, such as those in medical diagnosis, fraud detection, condition monitoring, etc., have imbalanced classes, where a minority class is usually more important and interesting than the majority class. In order to gain a deeper understanding of ensemble learning for imbalanced classes, this paper studies the impact of diversity on single-class performance measures theoretically and empirically. One of the main objectives of this paper is to find out if and when ensemble diversity can improve the classification performance on the important (minority) class.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5360524/,2009 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops,6-6 Dec. 2009,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fuzzy-CSFNN, Fuzzy-MLP and Fuzzy-RBF structures are constituted, and their performances are compared. Conic Section Function Neural Network (CSFNN) unifies the propagation rules of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks at a unique network by its distinctive propagation rules. That means CSFNNs accommodate MLPs and RBFs in its own self-network structure. The proposed approach is implemented in a well-known benchmark medical problem with real clinical data for thyroid and breast cancer disease diagnosis. Simulation results show that proposed hybrid structures outperform both MATLAB-ANFIS and non-hybrid structures.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5355297/,2009 International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering - ELECO 2009,5-8 Nov. 2009,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IoTDI54339.2022.00015,To Share or Not to Share: On Location Privacy in IoT Sensor Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Data sharing is crucial for building large datasets which in return are essential for developing and training accurate models in many contexts including smart cities, agriculture, and medical applications. However, shared data may leak private information, such as personal identifiers or location. Past research provides evidence that solely removing these identifiers through pseudonymization is not enough to ensure data privacy protection, since even the pseudonymized data may still contain information about the data provider. In this paper, we show that sensor data may leak a sensor&#x0027;s location even if the latter is not explicitly shared. Sensors are localized by linking sensor data with publicly available environmental data such as local weather. The proposed localization method relies on a machine learning model to predict weather data from sensor observations. Subsequently, the localization algorithm determines the sensor&#x0027;s location from the predicted weather trace using Bayesian filtering. We apply our approach to three real-world datasets where we (1) localize an ozone sensor given its readings, (2) localize a cow from activity parameters recorded with a tracker in the cow&#x0027;s reticulum, (3) localize solar panels based on their solar generation data. The achieved average localization accuracy of 5.68 km, 19.91 km, and 13.68 km on the above tasks, respectively, using data traces with a length of 365 days is remarkable. In addition, we introduce a mechanism, referred to as teleport, to protect location information in sensor data. The mechanism is based on deep models and masks the location by replacing the weather dependency with a different weather signature.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9797404/,2022 IEEE/ACM Seventh International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation (IoTDI),4-6 May 2022,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper describes the application of the Real-Time Maude tool to the formal modeling and analysis of a network integrating an x-ray machine, a ventilation machine, and a controller. This case study is motivated by an accidental death in an operating room.

10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092364,Towards real-time implementation of subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) — How to Identify optimum acoustic output for SHAPE?,IEEE,Conferences,"Pressure measurements within the chambers of the heart yield critical information for diagnosis and management of cardiac patients (~92 million Americans), but the procedure used to gain these pressures, cardiac catheterization, is invasive and expensive. Subharmonic aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) may be able to estimate intra-cardiac pressures noninvasively, if the optimum incident acoustic output (IAO) for SHAPE can be established in real-time. Therefore, the objective of this work was to determine in real-time the optimum IAO for SHAPE. We developed a customized interface on a SonixTablet scanner (BK Ultrasound, Richmond, BC, Canada) using C/C++ and Qt libraries (The Qt Company, Oslo, Norway). In vitro experiments were conducted using a closed-loop flow system. Activated Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging Inc, N. Billerica, MA, USA; 0.1 ml) was mixed with 750 ml isotonic diluent. A pressure catheter (Millar Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was used to acquire ambient pressure values. A pulsed Doppler gate was placed within the lumen of the vessel in the flow system, then the SHAPE algorithm was initiated (ftransmit: 5.6 MHz; chirp down transmit pulse; pulse inversion mode). The algorithm steps through all the available IAO levels, extracting and processing the subharmonic amplitude in real-time. The IAO level associated with the maximum derivative of the subharmonic amplitude is then chosen as the optimum IAO level. Simultaneous catheter pressure and subharmonic data were acquired at, below and above the optimum IAO level (10 secs; n = 3). Linear correlation between the subharmonic and catheter data was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). At the optimum IAO level the correlation coefficient between SHAPE and the pressure catheter data ranged between -0.6 and -0.9; for the IAO immediately below and above the optimum IAO, ranges were -0.4 to -0.8, and -0.6 to -0.8, respectively. In conclusion, optimum IAO level determination for insonating microbubbles to be utilized for SHAPE has been demonstrated; this will assist in real-time clinical applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8092364/,2017 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS),6-9 Sept. 2017,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However today's affective computers are limited in scope by their transferability to other application environments or that they monitor only one aspect of physiological emotion expression. Here, the use of a wireless EEG system, which can be implemented in a body area network, is used to investigate the potential of monitoring emotional valence in EEG, for application in real-life situations. The results show 82% accuracy for automatic classification of positive, negative and neutral valence based on film clip viewing, using features containing information on both the frequency content of the EEG and how this changes over time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6090412/,2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2011,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727769,Training cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks on imbalance data problems,IEEE,Conferences,"Many real-world problems are usually unbalanced, where datasets present skewed class distributions, such as failure diagnosis, spam detection, anomaly detection, fraud detection, oil spillage detection and medical diagnosis, etc. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a competitive machine learning technique with good performance in many applications. However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN. Extensive comparison with extreme learning machines is provided as a proof of the ability of the proposed approach to perform competitively on imbalanced datasets. An evolutionary algorithm is also implemented to optimize the misclassification costs for each class in cost matrix.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7727769/,2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),24-29 July 2016,ieeexplore,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/STCR51658.2021.9588878,Transfer Learning based Noise Classification in Chest X-Ray Images,IEEE,Conferences,"The chest radiograph (Chest X-ray) is the most commonly requested radiological examination owing to its effectiveness in the characterization and detection of cardiothoracic and pulmonary abnormalities. Deep Learning is emerging as the leading tool for medical image analysis. In particular, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be powerful tools for a wide range of computer vision tasks. The presence of noise in medical images reduces the efficacy of disease diagnosis and detection using manual inspection. This paper discusses different types of noise typically detected in Chest radiographs. The dataset is created using synthesized noise added mathematically onto the images. Transfer Learning methods are implemented in CNN based architectures to determine the best suitable model and the accuracy for real-time implementation. A comparison is also performed in training the model using data with augmentation and training without data augmentation. The geometrical variations induced in data augmentation and the three levels of noise added for each category suffice the requirement for generalizing the model to obtain validation accuracy of 99.41&#x0025; for VGGnet and DenseNet.
