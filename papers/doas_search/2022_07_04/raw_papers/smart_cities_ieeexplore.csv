10.1109/SBESC49506.2019.9046078,A Linked Data-Based Semantic Information Model for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"Smart cities typically involve a myriad of inter-connected systems intended to promote better management of urban and natural resources of cities, thereby contributing to the improve the quality of life of citizens. The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection. This paper also presents an implementation of LGeoSIM within Smart Geo Layers, a geographic-layered data middleware platform conceived to integrate data provided by heterogeneous sources in a smart city environment.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9046078/,2019 IX Brazilian Symposium on Computing Systems Engineering (SBESC),19-22 Nov. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/MSM49833.2020.9201644,A Preliminary Investigation of an Autonomous Vehicle Validation Infrastructure for Smart Cities,IEEE,Conferences,"The research and development of autonomous vehicle has entered the era of commercialization. While the vehicle self-driving technology has been growing rapidly, the validation for autonomous vehicle in terms of driving model, human factor model and traffic model is still maturing. Most of previous infrastructures are mainly focused on validation of those three models separately resorting either on real driving test at physical infrastructure or software simulation in virtualized infrastructure. However, neither the real driving test can cover all possible scenarios of autonomous driving and human factors, nor the virtualized software simulation can generate a feasible model for practical on/off-road driving. Furthermore, future autonomous transport in smart cities requires comprehensive validation. In order for autonomous vehicles to meet the autonomous transport in such complex traffic environment, an integrated testing and simulation infrastructure has been built targeting the systematic validation for autonomous vehicles: the Multi-User Environment for Autonomous Vehicle Innovation (MUEAVI). A preliminary investigation of a new autonomous vehicle validation infrastructure that can serve a multitude of research projects for smart city is presented.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9201644/,2020 International Conference Mechatronic Systems and Materials (MSM),1-3 July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In such public safety context, some police departments have been recording crime events in their databases to compose better strategies to understand and predict crime incidence. This work presents the ROTA-Analytics, a web-based application which aims to provide crime incidence forecasting as outputs. This crime incident forecasting helps patrol supervisors to elaborate the list of predefined locations (points) and staying time at which each police vehicle must patrol. ROTA-Analytics supports multiple machine and statistical learning methods selection to create an environment of crime prediction in different areas of the city.

Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups.

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated. The use cases are then evaluated based on the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The scope for future directions and conclusions are sketched towards the end, with an optimism that the current work will be an eye-opener and adaptable to other developing countries.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9183832/,"2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)",6-7 Aug. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the internet, Citizens in Smart Cities are able to perform their daily life activities online with their connected electronic devices. But, unfortunately, computer hackers tend to write automated malicious applications to attack websites on which these citizens perform their activities. These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques.

These systems can be thought of as the cities&#x2019; vision organs. It is anticipated that smart cities will produce a massive amount of data. Thus, to ensure the safety of its people, it is essential to conduct an efficient and real-time analysis of these data in order to receive timely responses in the event of catastrophic incidents. As a result, the process of transferring this vast data to the cloud for processing is relatively slow. In this paper, we present the software perspective to design and implement EFISS, a multilayer computing-based architecture for an intelligent, resourceefficient, and real-time surveillance system for smart cities. The framework, which is comprised of edge-fog computational layers, would help in the prevention of crime and the prediction of criminal incidents in smart cities.

In this paper, we study two research problems to maximize the overall Quality-of-Service (QoS) level of all IoT analytics that run on both data center servers and gateways. The first problem is to select additional IoT analytics to deploy on a gateway to save upload bandwidth due to transmitting raw sensor data. The second problem is to allocate the residue upload bandwidth among all IoT analytics to maximize the overall QoS level. We propose several algorithms to solve these two research problems.

These cities are technology-based and require interdisciplinary research and development for successful implementation. Over the last few decades, various technological interventions have created a tendency to provide smart everyday objects to make human life more comfortable. The emergence of the smart city paradigm is a response to creating a future city that guarantees the well-being and rights of its citizens from the perspective of industrial development: industry, urban planning, environment, and sustainable development. There are several subdomains in the smart city for the research. To work with the different subdomains in a smart city, proper guidance about the background of the smart city is required. This research paper is a guide for the same. This research paper represents a systematic literature review of the smart city domain. This paper carries out a systematic review of research papers published in various well-reputed journals like IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, etc., between 2011 and 2021. This paper will help the government, businesses, and researchers aiming to enhance the smart city concept. Initially, this paper discusses the origin and emergence of this concept, followed by a few definitions and characteristics with the real roadmap and primary supporting pillars of the smart city. This paper discusses a typical architecture having different layers like Sensing, Transportation, Data Management, and Application Layers. There are various supporting technologies and platforms for the smart city; hence implementations are impossible without these technologies and media. This research paper discusses different components of the smart city. A broad literature survey is being done to observe various challenges, opportunities, and future trends in the smart city.

Crowd management stands for the decisions and actions taken to supervise and control densely populated spaces and it involves multiple challenges, from recognition and assessment to application of actions tailored to the current situation. To that end, Wi-Fi-based monitoring systems have emerged as a cost-effective solution for the former one. The key challenge that they impose is the requirement to handle large datasets and provide results in near real-time basis. However, traditional big data and event processing approaches have important shortcomings while dealing with crowd management information. In this paper, we describe a novel system architecture for real-time crowd recognition for smart cities and smart buildings that can be easily replicated. The described system proposes a privacy-aware platform that enables the application of artificial intelligence mechanisms to assess crowds' behavior in buildings employing sensed Wi-Fi traces. Furthermore, the present paper shows the implementation of the system in two buildings, an airport and a market, as well as the results of applying a set of classification algorithms to provide crowd management information.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9144582/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Deployment of the Internet of Things-based sensors has considerably changed the dynamics of predicting air quality.

For example, if the intelligent video monitoring system cannot process a large amount of data locally, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, how to process data in the cloud without exposing the original data has become an important research topic. We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency. Although our algorithm has some tiny errors ( $10^{-6}$ ) when the data is too large, it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for blind image and video processing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162094/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"15 April15, 2021",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation.

This enormous popularity, however, breeds new challenging problems as the wireless spectrum gets saturated which increases the probability of collisions and performance degradation. To this end, smart spectrum decisions are needed and will be supported by wireless technology recognition to allow the networks to dynamically adapt to the ever changing environment where fair co-existence with other wireless technologies becomes essential. In contrast to existing research that assesses technology recognition using machine learning on powerful graphics processing units, this work aims to propose a deep learning solution using convolutional neural networks, cheap software defined radios and efficient embedded platforms such as NVIDIA's Jetson Nano. More specifically, this paper presents low complexity near-real time multi-band sub-GHz technology recognition and supports a wide variety of technologies using multiple settings.

In this paper, we address the task of detecting traffic events using two types of data, i.e. physical sensor observations and social media text. Unlike most existing studies focused on either analysing sensor observations or social media data, we identify traffic events with both types of data that may complement each other. We propose a Multi-modal Neural Network (MMN) to process sensor observations and social media texts simultaneously and detect traffic events.

These advanced technologies bring about numerous benefits and has begun to play a major role in daily lives, particularly data mining applied in precision agriculture to discover knowledge. Also in agro-industrial production chain, the combination of wireless and distributed specific sensor devices with the simulation of climatic conditions in order to track the evolution of grapes for wineries is outstanding. Mobile IoT such as narrow-band-IoT (NB-IoT) and the long-term evolution (LTE) for machines (LTE-M) are significant innovations of this accelerating development of IoT technologies. In the era of ubiquitous communication where everything is connected to the internet, NB-IoT systems are expected to offer better quality-of-services (QoS) to end users than the traditional IoT paradigm. However, offering better QoS satisfaction to end users will become a great challenge due to the bottleneck caused by the dual problem of increasing IoT use cases and the shortage of wireless spectrum resources. Whilst discussing the recent innovative solutions of NB-IoT resource allocation, significant challenges and open issues related to the real-time implementation of NBIoT are identified and discussed.

It is very necessary to process, store, and extract useful data at the edge of the Internet before transferring the data to central server which can be called Artificial Intelligence on The Edge. This research aims at studying, implementing and evaluating machine learning models which are suitable for running on limited computing embedded computers. Computer vision and real-time object detection techniques are applied on Nvidia Jetson Nano Embedded Computer to build an Edge-AI based traffic tracking and detecting sensor, two popular models (MobileNet-SSD and YOLOv4) have been studied and implemented to compare the performance on vehicle counting and license plate detection applications.

It has been shown that IoT devices typically lack appropriate security measures embedded, and hence are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Also, these devices are heterogeneous in their network communications that makes it difficult for operators of smart environments to manage them at scale. Existing monitoring solutions may perform well in certain environments, however, they do not scale cost-effectively and are inflexible to changes due to their static use of models. In this paper1, we use SDN to dynamically monitor a selected portion of IoT packets or flows, and develop specialized models to learn corresponding traffic signatures. Our first contribution develops a progressive inference pipeline, comprising a number of machine-learning models each is specialized in certain features of IoT traffic. Our inference engine dynamically obtains selected telemetry, including a subset of traffic or flow counters, using SDN techniques. Our second contribution develops three supervised multi-class classifiers, two are protocol specialists trained by packet-based features and one is flow-based model trained by behavioral characteristics of ten unidirectional flows. Our third contribution evaluates the performance of our scheme by replaying real traffic traces of 26 IoT devices on to an SDN switching simulator in conjunction with three trained Random Forest models.

EC requires judicious decisions which jointly consider the limited capacity of the edge servers and provided QoS of DL-dependent services. In a smart city environment, tasks may have varying priorities in terms of when and how to serve them; thus, priorities of the tasks have to be considered when making resource management decisions. In this paper, we focus on finding optimal offloading decisions in a three-tier user-edge-cloud architecture while considering different priority classes for the DL-based services and making a trade-off between a task&#x2019;s completion time and the provided accuracy by the DL-based service. We cast the optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) where the objective is to maximize a function called gain of system (GoS) defined based on provided QoS and priority of the tasks. We prove the problem is NP-hard. We then propose an efficient offloading algorithm, called PGUS, that is shown to achieve near-optimal results in terms of the provided GoS. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithm, PGUS, with heuristics and a state-of-the-art algorithm, called GUS, using both numerical analysis and real-world implementation.

In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference.

10.1109/RE.2019.00009,Requirements We Live By,IEEE,Conferences,"Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8920530/,2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),23-27 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing.

Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus.

10.1109/IoTDI54339.2022.00015,To Share or Not to Share: On Location Privacy in IoT Sensor Data,IEEE,Conferences,"Data sharing is crucial for building large datasets which in return are essential for developing and training accurate models in many contexts including smart cities, agriculture, and medical applications. However, shared data may leak private information, such as personal identifiers or location. Past research provides evidence that solely removing these identifiers through pseudonymization is not enough to ensure data privacy protection, since even the pseudonymized data may still contain information about the data provider. In this paper, we show that sensor data may leak a sensor&#x0027;s location even if the latter is not explicitly shared. Sensors are localized by linking sensor data with publicly available environmental data such as local weather. The proposed localization method relies on a machine learning model to predict weather data from sensor observations. Subsequently, the localization algorithm determines the sensor&#x0027;s location from the predicted weather trace using Bayesian filtering. We apply our approach to three real-world datasets where we (1) localize an ozone sensor given its readings, (2) localize a cow from activity parameters recorded with a tracker in the cow&#x0027;s reticulum, (3) localize solar panels based on their solar generation data. The achieved average localization accuracy of 5.68 km, 19.91 km, and 13.68 km on the above tasks, respectively, using data traces with a length of 365 days is remarkable. In addition, we introduce a mechanism, referred to as teleport, to protect location information in sensor data.

For the upcoming IoT era, narrow-band signals will play an important role in the exchange of sensor data and control signals in IoT networks. Indoor positioning is critical for many IoT applications, such as asset tracking, smart buildings, smart e-health, and smart cities, but it is very challenging to achieve accurate indoor positioning with narrowband signals because of multipath propagation. In this paper, we design a positioning system using narrowband signals, particularly ZigBee signals, based on an enhanced fingerprinting algorithm by fusing received signal strength (RSS) and time information. We first investigate the feasibility of time-based fingerprinting by handling the challenges as synchronization compensation among anchor nodes and design of sub-sample timestamps with a resolution of nanoseconds. Second, we design a feature-based fusion approach to fuse and standardize time and RSS fingerprints. Third, we adopt a random forest regression model to design an enhanced pattern matching algorithm for fingerprinting. We implement the proposed algorithms with software-defined radio techniques.

As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device.

In an IoT environment, several entities, including users, devices, and information resources, are interconnected and interworked with services. Therefore, interoperability between different entities is essential to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. Further, security is another important aspect to achieve in an IoT environment to protect information resources and privacy when networking between different entities. Therefore, security and interoperability may be significant barriers in the implementation of IoT in the real world. Several studies have been conducted to investigate methods for accomplishing interoperability and security in IoT, but they address only specific problems. Hence, compatibility and generality must be considered to accomplish the goals of IoT systems. International standards provide general methods by listing protocols, rules, guidelines, and characteristics that are defined and approved by authorized organizations, helping develop and manage systems efficiently by applying these standards; interoperability and security are supported by adopting standards in development and management. Therefore, the adoption of international standards is required to overcome the barriers in IoT. Furthermore, international standard organizations are developing IoT-related standards that may provide a solution to interoperability and security. However, a study focusing on interoperability- and security-related standards has not yet been conducted. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on international standards related to interoperability and security for IoT environments.

However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies.

However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests.

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m1 and m2 values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m1 and m2 are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal.

The solution is evaluated with multiple data sets containing environmental observations obtained in multiple real deployments. The real observations are leveraged to model the environment with which the mechanism interacts as realistically as possible. The proposed solution can significantly extend the sensors&#x2019; lifetime and is compared to an idealized, all-knowing scheduler to demonstrate that its performance is near optimal.

And while spatiotemporal data related to traffic is becoming common place due to the wide availability of cheap sensors and the rapid deployment of IoT platforms, the data still suffer some challenges related to sparsity, incompleteness, and noise which makes the traffic analytics difficult. In this article, we investigate the problem of missing data or noisy information in the context of real-time monitoring and forecasting of traffic congestion for road networks in a city. The road network is represented as a directed graph in which nodes are junctions (intersections) and edges are road segments. We assume that the city has deployed high-fidelity sensors for speed reading in a subset of edges; and the objective is to infer the speed readings for the remaining edges in the network; and to estimate the missing values in the segments for which sensors have stopped generating data due to technical problems (e.g., battery, network, etc.). We propose a tensor representation for the series of road network snapshots, and develop a regularized factorization method to estimate the missing values, while learning the latent factors of the network. The regularizer, which incorporates spatial properties of the road network, improves the quality of the results. The learned factors, with a graph-based temporal dependency, are then used in an autoregressive algorithm to predict the future state of the road network with a large horizon. Extensive numerical experiments with real traffic data from the cities of Doha (Qatar) and Aarhus (Denmark) demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for imputing the missing data and predicting the traffic state.

With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from $3.55 million to $1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58% to 22% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20% penetration level in commercial feeders.

In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9068215/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TNSE.2020.2998536,PassengerFlows: A Correlation-Based Passenger Estimator in Automated Public Transport,IEEE,Journals,"Human mobility information is widely needed by many sectors in smart cities, especially for public transport. This work designs lightweight algorithms to perform stop detection, passenger flow tracking, and passenger estimation in an automated train. The on-board learning and detection algorithms are running on an edge node that is integrated with Wi-Fi sniffing technology, a GPS sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. The stop detection algorithm determines if the automated train is static at which train station based on GPS and IMU data. When the train is moving, the correlations between statistical properties extracted from Wi-Fi probes and the actual number of passengers change. Therefore, two algorithms, passenger flow tracking and passenger estimation, are designed to analyze passenger mobility. The passenger flow tracking algorithm analyzes the number of incoming and outgoing passengers in the train. The passenger estimation algorithm approximates the number of passengers inside the train based on a multi-dimensional regression model created by statistical properties extracted from different device brands. The designed prototype is deployed in an automated hanging train to conduct real-world experiments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed passenger flow tracking algorithm reduces the average errors of 62.5% and 70% compared against two existing clustering algorithms respectively. When the devices' brands are split for creating a regression model, compared with two counting-based approaches, the proposed passenger estimation algorithm results in lower errors with a mean of 3.15 and a variance of 9.29.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9103621/,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,1 Oct.-Dec. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9153758/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,"1 Feb.1, 2021",ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The successful application of edge computing in the IoT will make our algorithms faster, more convenient, lower overall costs, providing better business practices, and enhance sustainability. Facial action unit (AU) detection recognizes facial expressions by analyzing cues about the movement of certain atomic muscles in the local facial area. According to the detected facial feature points, we could calculate the values of AU, and then use classification algorithms for emotion recognition. In edge devices, using optimized and custom algorithms to directly process the raw image data from each camera, the detected emotions can be more easily transmitted to the end-user. Due to the tremendous network overhead of transferring the facial action unit feature data, it poses challenges of a real-time facial expression recognition system being deployed in a distributed manner while running in production. Therefore, we designed a lightweight edge computing-based distributed system using Raspberry Pi tailed for this need, and we optimized the data transfer and components deployment. In the vicinity, the front-end and back-end processing modes are separated to reduce round-trip delay, thereby completing complex computing tasks and providing high-reliability, large-scale connection services.

These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting <i>unknown</i> system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks.

This paper aims to address short-term traffic prediction, a fundamental enabler for the success of ACC applications, under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute multi-access EC (MEC) architecture that exhibits constraints different from conventional cloud computing. First, a data-centric experiment platform is designed and implemented to facilitate traffic prediction algorithm development. This paper further proposes a novel short-term traffic prediction model that integrates a traffic light model and a vehicle velocity model, considering limited computing resources of MEC servers. We note that the effects of traffic lights are complicated and have not been rigorously examined in most, if not all, of the related work. This work models the queueing time when a driver arrives at a road intersection and faces a red light. Moreover, to forecast the vehicle velocity, we propose a novel low-complexity semiparametric prediction model considering periodic features and spatial/temporal correlations of dynamic road events. The experiment results demonstrate that our vehicle-velocity prediction model achieves almost equivalent accuracy to the well-known Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network model, requiring much lower computational complexity. Our experiment results also confirm that since our integrated model pays attention to the traffic-light effects and the individual driver behavior, it can more effectively capture the real-time changes of traffic conditions.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8641378/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,April 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00233,Water Level Estimation Based on Image of Staff Gauge in Smart City,IEEE,Conferences,"In the automatic measurement of water level, the hydrological satiation also uses a traditional staff gauge to calibrate the water depth measured by the sensor. And in the most of water-covered areas, such as underpass overpasses, low-lying roads and tunnels, staff gauges have been installed to monitor road water. Therefore, the automatic water level measurement method based on staff gauge image, has drawn more and more attention. So we propose a method for the water level estimation based on images of staff gauge in this paper. First, we proposed a two-step method for segmenting the staff gauge. We implemented the initial positioning by HSV color space and morphological processing, and then we defined a component map to achieve precise positioning. Next, we split the characters on the staff gauge image and recognized those characters through a Convolutional Neural Network. Finally, we measured the water level by using a quadratic function to determine the mapping relationship between pixels and the metric values. Compared with the traditional method of extracting water line, the two-step positioning method improves the water level detection accuracy. The measurement result in a real world image of a pond shows more accurate detection with the algorithm and the feasibility of applying it to road water monitoring.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8560211/,"2018 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced & Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing & Communications, Cloud & Big Data Computing, Internet of People and Smart City Innovation (SmartWorld/SCALCOM/UIC/ATC/CBDCom/IOP/SCI)",8-12 Oct. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS). Cities currently designed for cars can turn into cities developed for citizens using FAGVinSCF enabling more sustainable cities.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9305204/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%.

Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year).

TMIS using multidisciplinary research and application involves advanced technologies in information processing, telecommunications, bio-sensing, and artificial intelligence including smart technologies. TMIS leverages the latest mobile and wireless communication technologies and widely available internet infrastructure to deliver quality services to home patients enabling them to remotely access information about their health and obtain telemedical services.

It is impractical to aggregate all video streams from hundreds of thousands of cameras for big data analysis. Transcoding the videos to low-bitrate ones is the conventional solution to solve the aggregation bottleneck. However, it is recognized that transcoding will inevitably affect visual feature extraction, consequently degrading the subsequent analysis performance. To address these challenges, we thus propose a new video big data analysis framework, called end-edge-cloud collaborative system. Under the end-edge-cloud collaborative framework, a camera can output two streams simultaneously, including a compressed video stream for viewing and data storage, and a compact feature stream extracted from the original video signals for visual analysis. Video stream and feature stream are synchronized by unified identification. We identify three key technologies to enable the end-edge-cloud collaborative system, including analysis-friendly video coding, visual feature compact descriptor, and user-defined neural network and parameter updating. By real-time feeding only the feature streams into the cloud center, these cameras thus form a large-scale brain-like vision system for the smart city.

Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed.

Traditional demand prediction methods mostly considered about inter-regional traffic, events, activities, and weather, while they overlooked the influence of other travel modes, such as metro. In this paper, we propose a Deep Taxi-Metro Spatial-Temporal Network framework, namely TMST-Net, to model the spatiotemporal relationships between the taxi demand and the metro crowd flows. In detail, we apply residual neural networks to model temporal (current, day, and week) properties of the taxi demand in each area. For each feature, we apply residual convolutional units to handle the spatial properties of taxi demand. Likewise, we apply the same method to model the metro crowd flows. TMST-Net learns to assign different weights between taxi and metro by aggregating the output of the three residual neural networks and the external factors to forecast the final taxi demand for each area in the next timestamp.

Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language.

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context, not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this paper, we present a system for the classification of vehicles based on their radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and maintenance properties.

However, these extensions entail a high initialization overhead due to the underlying cryptographic mechanisms. While some approaches provide first optimizations by pre-initializing this confidential environment, it is unclear which devices need to be pre-initialized - too many unnecessary devices are inefficient, and ad-hoc initialization still takes too long, especially when the user is moving. In this paper, we tackle this initialization issue by proposing PDSProxy++-a PDS extension for proactive multi-hop deployment of AI services. Inspired by the human eye, PDSProxy++ is based on a central cone (foveal vision) and a surrounding smaller circle (peripheral vision), which determine the nearby IoT devices to be initialized.

Current solutions require the model developer to make the placement decision by manually assigning models to edge devices. However, an Edge AI solution could entail hundreds of mobile edge devices operating in a large geographical region (e.g., installed on vehicles) with various resource capabilities and different DNN models, hence rendering manual placement ineffective. This paper presents alternative methods to automatically place various models on a diverse set of edge devices, considering the geospatial coverage of video data, resource capabilities of edge devices, and the characteristics of the trained models. First, we mathematically formulate the model placement as an optimization problem which is proven to be NP-Hard. We then propose several heuristics to solve it efficiently and evaluate them with a real-world dataset collected along the 165 bus route trajectories in the City of San Francisco.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it.

Wheatman et al. [11] present Runtime Assurance for Distributed Intelligent Control Systems (RADICS) that extends the Simplex architecture [9] to provide runtime assurance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) being controlled by machine learning al-gorithms. RADICS can thus allow designers to guarantee some minimum level of system performance via a safety controller while simultaneously allowing for greater average performance via an artificial intelligence (AI) controller. Existing implementations of RADICS have focused on simulated applications such as vehicular traffic control using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [5] and Flow [12] environments. The aim of this project is to implement RADICS in a physical environment in order to investigate and understand the limitations and challenges of physical deployments.

As a demonstration at ICCPS, we hope to use this testbed deployment to study the impact of real-world issues such as communication latencies, sensor failures, and incomplete information on the RADICS runtime assurance system. We also plan to extend the physical testbed into a hardware-in-the-loop smart city environment where the fidelity of the physical testbed will complement the scalability and flexibility of simulated components.

This is particularly true for Hamburg, a Hanseatic city in the north of Germany. Hamburg is the smartest city in Germany according to a Federal Association for Information Technology. Although there are no megacities in the European Union (the largest city in the European Union is Berlin with 3.7 million inhabitants), the increasing urbanization is apparent and produces problems to be solved. At the same time rural depopulation creates conjugated problems.One category of these problems is mobility. Mobility can be regarded as the need to move persons and freight. In densely populated cities an increasing amount of transport users have to share a decreasing amount of space with conflicting needs. At the same time in rural areas, a dwindling supply of local public transport makes the mobility of the remaining residents more difficult. The same applies to parcel delivery or the supply of goods. Autonomous systems have great potential to create a sustainable and livable environment. The author has initiated a publicly funded project to investigate technologies of autonomous mobile systems which interact with a smart city. The test area intelligent urban mobility (Testfeld intelligente Quartiersmobilitat) at the campus of Hamburgs University of Applied Sciences is created to do research on connected and autonomous mobile systems like multipurpose robots and other mobility users like pedestrians with a smartphone. A particular focus is on neighborhood mobility. This means that distances of less than 3 kilometers usually have to be covered. The special type of needs in neighborhood mobility has two important aspects that affect development of autonomous mobile systems: It is slow mobility and the transport users are especially vulnerable. The acceptance of the residents of autonomous systems is equally important, as is the protection of privacy when collecting environmental data. They are expected to make decisions on their own in complex environments. The real world usually differs from a simulation or an experimental setup in a laboratory - a problem commonly referred to as Sim-2-Real gap. Active and non-destructive exploration is expected from an autonomous system to solve unexpected problems. Machine learning methods come into play which in turn have their own pitfalls.

To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area.

Data transmission between vehicles uses a peer-to-peer network in which every node communicates directly with every other node, verified by their relevant end-point nodes; lane's acquisition right is approved by all relevant vehicle nodes, as well as with consensus agreed upon via smart contract.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8669412/,2019 International Conference on Platform Technology and Service (PlatCon),28-30 Jan. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The IoT paradigm, enhanced with intelligence and big data analytics, has found applications in a wide range of solutions such as smart home, smart city, industrial IoT etc. Even though IoT implies that cheap motes can conduct a specific task, thus a large number of them can be deployed, we aim to minimize the installed hardware while we still have a high level of quality of service. Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions. In this paper, we propose a concept of an IoT testbed which allows virtual IoT resources to be immersed and tested in real life conditions, which are met in everyday life. Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed while taking into account specific use cases, regarding luminosity scenarios in industrial environments.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804746/,2019 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS),29-31 May 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011477,A Data Security Enhanced Access Control Mechanism in Mobile Edge Computing,IEEE,Journals,"Mobile edge computing, with characteristics of position awareness, mobile support, low latency, decentralization, and distribution, has received widespread attention from industry and academia, and has been applied to application areas such as intelligent transportation, smart city, and real-time big data analysis. However, it also brings the new security threats, especially data security threats during data access that leads to unauthorized/unauthorized access, alteration and disclosure of data, affecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore, access control, as an important method to ensure the security of user data during data access, began to be applied to mobile edge computing. However, the existing access control has the disadvantages of coarse-grain, poor flexibility and accuracy, lack of internal attack considerations, etc., which cannot meet the needs of data security in practical applications of mobile edge computing. In this paper, a data security enhanced Fine-Grained Access Control mechanism (FGAC) is proposed to ensure data security during data access in mobile edge computing. In FGAC, a dynamic fine-grained trusted user grouping scheme based on attributes and metagraphs theory was first designed. Secondly, the scheme was combined with the traditional role-based access control mechanism to assign roles to users based on user group credibility. And then, based on attribute matching the user authentication further verifies whether the user is allowed to perform the access operations to achieve fine-grained data protection. Experimental results show that FGAC can effectively identify malicious users and make group adjustments, while achieving fine-grained access control and assure the data security during the data access process in mobile edge computing.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9146646/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
10.1109/TASE.2021.3077537,A Hybrid Prediction Method for Realistic Network Traffic With Temporal Convolutional Network and LSTM,IEEE,Journals,"Accurate and real-time prediction of network traffic can not only help system operators allocate resources rationally according to their actual business needs but also help them assess the performance of a network and analyze its health status. In recent years, neural networks have been proved suitable to predict time series data, represented by the model of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). This article proposes a novel hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM) for such network traffic prediction, which synergistically combines the power of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay (SG) filter, the TCN, as well as the LSTM. ST-LSTM employs a three-phase end-to-end methodology serving time series prediction. It first eliminates noise in raw data using the SG filter, then extracts short-term features from sequences applying the TCN, and then captures the long-term dependence in the data exploiting the LSTM. Experimental results over real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ST-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. <i>Note to Practitioners</i>&#x2014;This work considers real-time and high-accuracy prediction of network traffic. It is highly important to well predict network traffic by capturing long-term dependence and effectively extracting high- and low-frequency information from time series data. Yet, it is a big challenge to achieve it because there are unstable characteristics and strong nonlinear features in the network traffic due to continuous expansion of network scale and fast emergence of new services. Current prediction methods usually have oversimplified theoretical assumptions, need significant time and memory, or suffer problems of gradient disappearance or early convergence. Thus, they fail to effectively capture the nonlinear characteristics of large-scale network sequences. This work proposes a hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM), which integrates the merits of the Savitzky&#x2013;Golay filter, the temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the long short-term memory (LSTM), serving as smoothing time series, capturing short-term local features, and capturing long-term dependence, respectively. Experimental results based on the real-life dataset demonstrate that it achieves better prediction accuracy than its state-of-the-art peers, including the TCN and the LSTM. It can be readily implemented and deployed in many real-life industrial areas including smart city, edge computing, cloud computing, and data centers.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9439149/,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,July 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, real-time reidentification in a network of cameras, such as those deployed in a smart city, and from other sources, such as social media platforms, remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new embedding algorithm pipeline is presented to extract and administrate the crowd-sourced facial image features (e.g., social media platforms and multicameras in a dense crowd, such as a stadium or airport). The proposed facial embedding is a privacy-aware parameterized function, which maps facial images to high-dimensional vectors in order to facilitate the identification and tracking of individuals. In other words, we are able to uniquely identify person(s) of interest, without the need to determine their true identity. To extract the facial embedding information in crowds, concurrent residual neural network (ResNet) embedding pipeline for each camera is proposed. Specifically, facial embedding feature vectors are generated in real-time by each camera using the proposed enhanced ResNet architecture, which is trained with vectorized-l2-loss function for face recognition. The multivariate kernel density estimation matching algorithm is then applied to facial embedding pipelines generated by cameras at the fog cloud for identity reidentification and security verification. This allows us to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the camera without compromising on the capability for identity reidentification. Evaluations using mixed datasets in real-time demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves a 2.6% accuracy over other state-of-the-art approaches.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063888/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,Aug. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The sensor data streams generated from these applications are largely dynamic, heterogeneous, and often geographically distributed over large areas. For high-value use in business, industry and services, these data streams must be mined to extract insightful knowledge, such as about monitoring (e.g., discovering certain behaviors over a deployed area) or network diagnostics (e.g., predicting faulty sensor nodes). However, due to the inherent constraints of sensor networks and application requirements, traditional data mining techniques cannot be directly used to mine IoT data streams efficiently and accurately in real-time. In the last decade, a number of works have been reported in the literature proposing behavioral pattern mining algorithms for sensor networks. This paper presents the technical challenges that need to be considered for mining sensor data.

Among all the models in flow prediction, deep learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks) are popular and outperform other statistics and machine learning models, since they can learn intrinsic structures and extract features from spatial–temporal (ST) data. However, most of them set strict temporal periods in the prediction or separate the interaction between spatial and temporal correlations. Therefore, the prediction accuracy is affected. To overcome the difficulties, we propose a flow prediction network attentive spatial–temporal convolutional network (ASTCN), which can effectively handle large-scale flow data and learn complex features. In ASTCN, we leverage an attention mechanism to overcome the previous problem of strict temporal periods, and can effectively fuse ST data with multiple factors from different time-series sources. Furthermore, we propose a causal 3-D convolutional layer based on temporal convolutional networks (TCNs). It can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to improve the prediction accuracy. We comprehensively conducted our experiments based on real-world data sets. Experimental results show that ASTCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 3.78% in root mean square error.

10.1109/TII.2022.3162306,Guest Editorial: Special Section on Distributed Intelligence Over Internet of Things,IEEE,Journals,"N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing, Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be applied widely in wireless IoT networks. To reduce the resource consumption in CNN-based applications, Jia et al. [6] propose the CNN-based Resource Optimization APProach which utilizes model compression and computation sharing to optimize inner-model and inter-model respectively, and the comparison results show the superior performance in scalability and the decrease of resource cost. In mobile crowdsensing activities, Gao et al. [4] propose a differential Location Privacy-preserving Mechanism based on Trajectory obfuscation (LPMT) to protect the location privacy of mobile users, which includes three operations: stay points extraction, stay points obfuscation and stay points sampling. In order to mimic the task-free bottom-up visual attention process by predicting salient regions on natural images, Umer et al.

The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$CoGS$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and the lead time (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$LT$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large-scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this article proposes a multipopulation ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLSs). First, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$CoGS$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$LT$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, which helps to search in the biobjective space sufficiently.

The detection position was repositioned according to the estimated speed of target by an optical flow method, and the alternate template was stored with a template update mechanism, which is all computed at the edge.

These multi-modal data are usually transmitted and received by signal stations deployed in the city. However, reasonably choosing the signal stations' locations is still an open issue for enhancing people's life quality in the smart city.

However, the limitations of cache capacity make it difficult to develop an effective common caching framework that satisfies diverse user preferences. In this article, we propose a new content caching strategy that maximizes the cache hit ratio through flexible prediction in dynamically changing network and user environments. It is based on a hierarchical deep learning architecture: long short-term memory (LSTM)-based local learning and ensemble-based meta-learning. First, as a local learning model, we employ an LSTM method with seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL)-based preprocessing. It identifies the attributes for demand prediction on the contents in various demographic user groups. Second, as a metalearning model, we employ a regression-based ensemble learning method, which uses an online convex optimization framework and exhibits sublinear “regret” performance. It orchestrates the obtained multiple demographic user preferences into a unified caching strategy in real time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the popular MovieLens data sets. It was shown that the proposed control provides up to a 30% higher cache hit ratio than conventional representative algorithms and a near-optimal cache hit ratio within approximately 9% of the optimal caching scheme with perfect prior knowledge of content popularity.

These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering.

10.1109/BigCom53800.2021.00035,A Method for Short-term Traffic Flow Prediction and Control on Urban Road,IEEE,Conferences,"The prediction and control of short-term traffic flow have become one of the key fields of urban traffic research. However, there are some issues to be addressed, such as the low accuracy of current urban road short-term traffic flow prediction and the high traffic congestion rate resulted from most urban road traffic signal control methods. In this paper, we propose a short-term traffic flow prediction method based on graph convolution neural network and Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence) model, which can excavate the spatial and temporal relationships among road traffic flows and jointly perform multi-step predictions to realize a more accurate prediction of short-term traffic flows. In addition, a regional traffic signal control method based on the back-pressure algorithm is proposed, which is based on single-point traffic signal control to establish a distributed regional traffic signal coordination control model, thus effectively realizing dynamic traffic control with a lower congestion rate. Compared to other related methods, we compare and simulate the current short-term traffic flow prediction and urban road traffic signal control methods via actual experiments to demonstrate the practicability of our method. Based on the two method, we conduct two experiment using real world data and compare our method with the current traffic flow prediction and traffic signal control method. After that, we get three conclusions. First, our short-term traffic flow prediction method is clearly outperformed than the LSTM algorithm and ARIMA algorithm in terms of root mean square error, average absolute error and average absolute percentage error. Second, compared with the timing traffic signal control method, our regional traffic signal control method greatly reduces the average waiting time, average travel time and average number of waiting vehicles. Besides, compared to the single-point traffic signal control method, the experiment presents that our method makes a significant improvement in reducing the traffic congestion rate.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9546861/,2021 7th International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BigCom),13-15 Aug. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Urban traffic congestions lead to a lot of time consumption and exhaust emissions. So alleviating congested situation will have a good impact on both economy and environment. The signal control at urban intersections is an effective and most important way to reduce the traffic jams and collisions. A lot of control theories including traditional mathematical ways and modern artificial intelligent ways have been exploited. ADP is an effective and amiable intelligent control method. We proposed an algorithm to adjust the signal time plan at urban traffic intersections based on ADP theory. Simulations are taken under a microscopic traffic simulation software, TSIS(Traffic Software Integrated System).

10.1109/ITSC.2019.8917004,A neuro-dynamic programming approach for perimeter control of two urban regions with macroscopic fundamental diagrams,IEEE,Conferences,"Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) model is widely used to describe urban traffic dynamic system. Based on the MFD model, perimeter control methods are developed to ensure the efficiency of the system. However, most existing perimeter control methods would suffer from two shortcomings, i.e., linearization of the MFD function, accurate calibration of MFD and travel demand. These prerequisites would undermine the performance of the system if an accurate calibration cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand, an optimization scheme of network performance without excessive knowledge of state variables but based on traffic data is preferable. In this study, an optimal feedback controller based on the neuro-dynamic that approximates the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) is introduced. Firstly, the value function is approximated by a neural network. Then the parameters are optimized by the policy iteration method, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative error toward set-point. Furthermore, the optimal control law constrained by a saturated operator is implemented based on real-time observations recursively. The neuro-dynamic controller is tested for the two-regional MFD system.

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques.

The approach uses neural networks to predict the changes in heading and speed of an ego vehicle for a specified prediction horizon and sample time which can be shared over V2X for collision avoidance or used in further advanced driver assistance systems. Predicting changes allows a location-independent trajectory representation based on the vehicle's current speed and heading. The prediction is carried out for the four predefined maneuvers “turn left”, “turn right”, “go straight” and “lane follow”. Several neural networks with different input data configurations are evaluated for the same prediction task. The available network inputs are images from a front-facing camera, heading information, vehicle speed and turning indicator signals. For training the networks a dataset was created from several hours of riding an electric bicycle in structured and unstructured environments of a city. In addition the networks have been implemented on an embedded GPU platform to investigate the real-time capability of the presented approach. The networks were configured and trained to predict five seconds into the future with a sample time of 0.2 s. The results of each network are presented and compared against each other.

However, literature on the simultaneous introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is very scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to minimise waiting times. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling a real-world intersection serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are proposed. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK, to which the agent has been since deployed. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the quantities used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565054/,2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC),19-22 Sept. 2021,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This raises the necessity to understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable distribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial intelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and transition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban growth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature using simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work is to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify transition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that is designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and population density. Transition rules in our model identify the required neighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration is performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic algorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters, including objective function, initial population, selection, crossover and mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic algorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential implementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values using a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations. Minimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors, is used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated in term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration with genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal rule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed calibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban growth of Indianapolis-IN, USA.

In the proposed multi-level feature alignment method, we first translate images from one domain to another one. Then the discriminative feature representations extracted by the deep neural network are concatenated, followed by domain adversarial learning to make the intermediate feature distribution of the target domain images close to those in the source domain.

10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799799,Detecting urban traffic congestion with single vehicle,IEEE,Conferences,"Traffic congestion in urban areas is a severe problem in many cities around the world. Conventional infrastructure-based solutions to detect traffic congestion, such as surveillance cameras and road surface inductive loops, have the limitations of high deployment costs and limited coverage. In recent years, due to the popularity of mobile devices, solutions that do not require pre-deployed infrastructure start to emerge; in these solutions, sensor data is collected by mobile devices onboard the vehicles, sent to a central server via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) or cellular communications, and used collectively to determine the traffic states of the roads. However, existing solutions require data from a considerably large number of vehicles on the same road to accurately detect traffic congestion of a particular road. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect the traffic states of the roads with only the data from a single vehicle. The biggest advantage of such an approach is that, unlike previously proposed solutions, the system can function properly even if there is only a smaller number of vehicles equipped with the system, which is usually the case at the early stage of the deployment of a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network or a large-scale intelligent transportation system. In our solution, machine learning mechanisms are utilized to classify the traffic state by extracting the movement behaviors of a vehicle. Our model development and performance evaluation utilize highly accurate vehicle traces collected at several real-world intersections with lidar. In addition, to properly label the obtained data traces to either congested or free-flow and accurately reflect the reality, a previously proposed theoretical method is used in combination with human labeling. Evaluation shows that our approach can achieve a detection accuracy of 88.94%.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6799799/,2013 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE),2-6 Dec. 2013,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Firstly, a GRU classification model is constructed by recurrent neural network to identify the driver's driving intention from vehicle running data. Then, based on the information of transportation infrastructure and some networked vehicles, the short-term traffic speed could be predicted by shockwave method from edge computing.

With the advances of wireless charging technologies and the inspiration from the sparse crowdsensing paradigm, this paper proposes a novel drone-based collaborative sparse-sensing framework DroneSense, demonstrating its feasibility for sustainable urban-scale sensing. We focus on a typical use case, i.e., leveraging DroneSense to sense open parking spaces. DroneSense selects a minimum number of Points of Interest (POIs) to schedule drones for physical data sensing and then infers the parking occupancy of the remaining POIs to meet the overall quality requirement. However, drone-based sensing is different from human-centric crowdsensing, resulting in a series of new problems, including which POIs are visited first, when and where to charge drones, which drones to charge first, how much to charge, and when to stop the scheduling. To this end, we design a holistic solution, including context-aware matrix factorization for parking occupancy data inference, progressive determination of task quantity, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based task selection, energy-aware DRL-based task scheduling, and adaptive charger scheduling. Extensive experiments with a real-world on-street parking dataset from Shenzhen, China demonstrate the obvious advantages of DroneSense.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796795/,IEEE INFOCOM 2022 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,2-5 May 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Urban airspace will include many more Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and AI techniques to detect the presence of RPAS.

Traditional water-level sensors for large-scale river can detect water-level rising, though they have limitations in detecting urban river dyke height to alert about flooding. This is a result of various riverside environmental limitations. Additionally, previous prediction methods are difficult to detect CWF flooding with high accuracy because water rising differ depends on a location's environment. Therefore, we propose a detection scheme for CWF by developing a water-level sensor system that works in various installation environments using infrared image processing with both low installation and operation cost. We implemented a CWF prediction system that produces accurate and early predictions using a Linear Regression (LR) of deep learning approach with data assimilation.

Due to the scarcity of real-life urban traffic data, many transportation planning applications need to generate synthesized traffic flows based on the real-life trajectory datasets. However, those synthesized traffic flows can only fit the input trajectories, which are static and does not reflect the real traffic distributions. In this paper, we use a stochastic origin-destination (OD) matrix to represent the density of the dynamic traffic flows and then develop a dynamic traffic flow generator. We extract the stochastic OD matrix from the trajectory data, design an efficient neural network to the predict successive stochastic OD matrices, and deploy our model on a real-world road network.

Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy. Finally we evaluate our model with the real Beijing subway data and compare with other traditional models on short-term passenger flows prediction tasks.

Moreover, we develop a novel inverse preference learning algorithm to infer the passengers' preferences and predict the future human behavior changes, e.g., ridership, of a new urban transit plan before its deployment. We validate our proposed framework using a unique real-world dataset (from Shenzhen, China) with three subway lines opened during the data time span.

10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488713,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Urban Crowd Sensing with For-Hire Vehicles,IEEE,Conferences,"Recently, vehicular crowd sensing (VCS) that leverages sensor-equipped urban vehicles to collect city-scale sensory data has emerged as a promising paradigm for urban sensing. Nowadays, a wide spectrum of VCS tasks are carried out by for-hire vehicles (FHVs) due to various hardware and software constraints that are difficult for private vehicles to satisfy. However, such FHV-enabled VCS systems face a fundamental yet unsolved problem of striking a balance between the order-serving and sensing outcomes. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph convolutional cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (GCC-MARL) framework, which helps FHVs make distributed routing decisions that cooperatively optimize the system-wide global objective. Specifically, GCC-MARL meticulously assigns credits to agents in the training process to effectively stimulate cooperation, represents agents' actions by a carefully chosen statistics to cope with the variable agent scales, and integrates graph convolution to capture useful spatial features from complex large-scale urban road networks. We conduct extensive experiments with a real-world dataset collected in Shenzhen, China, containing around 1 million trajectories and 50 thousand orders of 553 taxis per-day from June 1st to 30th, 2017.

10.1109/ICDM.2018.00114,Outlier Detection in Urban Traffic Flow Distributions,IEEE,Conferences,"Urban traffic data consists of observations like number and speed of cars or other vehicles at certain locations as measured by deployed sensors. These numbers can be interpreted as traffic flow which in turn relates to the capacity of streets and the demand of the traffic system. City planners are interested in studying the impact of various conditions on the traffic flow, leading to unusual patterns, i.e., outliers. Existing approaches to outlier detection in urban traffic data take into account only individual flow values (i.e., an individual observation). This can be interesting for real time detection of sudden changes. Here, we face a different scenario: The city planners want to learn from historical data, how special circumstances (e.g., events or festivals) relate to unusual patterns in the traffic flow, in order to support improved planing of both, events and the layout of the traffic system. Therefore, we propose to consider the sequence of traffic flow values observed within some time interval. Such flow sequences can be modeled as probability distributions of flows. We adapt an established outlier detection method, the local outlier factor (LOF), to handling flow distributions rather than individual observations. We apply the outlier detection online to extend the database with new flow distributions that are considered inliers. For the validation we consider a special case of our framework for comparison with state-of-the-art outlier detection on flows. In addition, a real case study on urban traffic flow data showcases that our method finds meaningful outliers in the traffic flow data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594923/,2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2018,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, it is highly costly and time-consuming to obtain many travel time data. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm structure to calculate the travel time which utilize neural network to dynamically predict future speed and employ data fusion to integrate the speed data of different detectors in a urban expressway link. Based on the algorithm structure, two practical travel time prediction algorithms, called as Space Discretization Travel Time Calculation Algorithm (SDTCM) and Speed Integral Travel Time Calculation Method (SITCM), were developed by the discretization of the space and integral of the predicted speed. Vehicle plate recognition technology was used to collect the real travel time data in the test section on Beijing Third-Ring urban expressway to evaluate the algorithms. The obtained results show that the average prediction error of two algorithms are both less than 10% which can meet the requirement of the field applications and the algorithms are easy to be implemented as no travel time data collection are needed in advance. The two algorithms have some advantages and disadvantages over each other in accuracy and smoothness.

To respond to this situation, there have been lots of researches on aerial base stations (BSs) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the mobile user. Aerial BS has the advantage of providing flexible communication range by avoiding obstacles such as buildings in urban areas through 3D positioning. However, finding an optimal point for aerial BS considering the variance of user's requirements, movement, and obstacles in real time is difficult problem to solve. Therefore, it is necessary to find an approximate optimal point for applying to the real-time flight path control of aerial BS.

10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966128,Scalable deep traffic flow neural networks for urban traffic congestion prediction,IEEE,Conferences,"Tracking congestion throughout the network road is a critical component of Intelligent transportation network management systems. Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in realtime based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California.

UTS then tracks the vehicles using a 3D bounding box representation and a physically reasonable 3D motion model relying on an unscented Kalman filter based approach. Since UTS recovers positions, shape and motion information in a three-dimensional world coordinate system, it can be employed to recognize diverse traffic violations or to supply intelligent vehicles with valuable traffic information. We build on YOLOv3 as a detector yielding 2D bounding boxes and class labels for each vehicle. A 2D detector renders our system much more independent to different camera perspectives as a variety of labeled training data is available. This allows for a good generalization while also being more hardware efficient. The task of 3D tracking based on 2D detections is supported by integrating class specific prior knowledge about the vehicle shape. We quantitatively evaluate UTS using self generated synthetic data and ground truth from the CARLA simulator, due to the non-existence of datasets with an urban vehicle surveillance setting and labeled 3D bounding boxes.

In this paper, based on over 890 million records of vehicles collected on ramps in Hangzhou, China, we established dynamic congestion threshold for each road segment with external factors. Based on such dynamic congestion threshold, we further clustered the congestion evolution patterns, and designed adaptive ramp controller which could switch the controller parameter according to the predicted congestion evolution pattern. Finally, in order to show the performance among different strategies, we introduced three baseline groups, which are `without Controller', `ALINEA controller', and `Direct RBF(radial basis function)-neural network controller', respectively.The evaluation of proposed controller design over real large-scale data indicated that our method achieves 8.4%(7.2%), 4.62%(9.48%) efficiency improvement in terms of average speed in km/h (average traffic flow in veh/h) than the performance with normal ALINEA controller and RBF-neural network controller respectively.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8815863/,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,Oct. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Generally, an adaptive signal control system fine-tunes signal timing parameters based on pre-defined control hyperparameters using instantaneous traffic detection information. Once traffic pattern changes, those hyperparameters (e.g., maximum and minimum green times) need to be adjusted according to the evolution of traffic dynamics over a very short-term period. Such adjustment processes are usually conducted by professional and experienced traffic engineers. Here we present a human-in-the-loop parallel learning framework and its utilization in an end-to-end recommendation system that mimics and enhances professional signal control engineers' behaviors.

Due to the constrained resource devices and hazardous deployment, urban sensing is vulnerable to interference and destruction of external factors or the impact of external environmental emergencies. Abnormal data, outliers, or anomalies have affected the utility in various domains seriously. Timely and accurate detection of unexpected events, monitoring of network performance, and anomaly detection of data flow are of great significance to improve the decision-making ability of the system. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method for urban sensing based on sequential data and credibility. First, based on Bayesian methods, a reputation model is established for the selection of credible sample points. Second, aiming at the problem that the threshold range is difficult to determine in the traditional method, the pivot quantity is defined by using the median of the credible sample, and the confidence interval can be estimated to quantify the deviation degree of the sensor data. Finally, an anomaly data identification and source verification approach is proposed to distinguish errors and events accurately.

A Causal Evaluative Review and Methodical Redirection for Intelligence Systems,IEEE,Journals,"The chronic growth of networked complexities in today's world, now require highly efficient evolvable systems. However, diverse open issues and inabilities are facing urban planning practice and social sciences due to the limitations of artificial intelligence planning tools. These incapacities have relatively limited our ability to perceive and handle possible present and future temperamental situations in socio-physical contexts and in real-time modes. Here, we theoretically present two simple philosophical and systematic causal models to help software engineers to understand this philosophical and complexity dilemma from an urban planning perspective. The first model evaluates the reliance on perceptual and bounding trajectories. It discusses discrete and finite-expert systems that perceive specific parts of self-organization's complexities, while bounding limited facets only of general intelligence to address certain issues in urban planning and social contexts. This implies the second causal model that is based on aligning to urban self-organizational happenings, by putting philosophical foundations for a responsive artificial superintelligence (ASI).

However, the existing CNN-based feature extraction algorithms, especially residual network, cannot obtain powerful semantic information in the vehicle detection task, and thus suffer from the problem of a missing detection, error detection, or repeated detection. In this paper, we present a connect-and-merge convolutional neural network (CMNet) for fast detecting vehicles in complex scenes. First, we propose a connect-and-merge residual network (CMRN) for performing feature extraction. Specifically, the CMRN assembles residual branches in parallel through a connect-and-merge mapping: Connect the input to the outputs of two residual branches separately (Connect), and merge the outputs of the connection as the input of the subsequent residual block (Merge), respectively. Second, we present a multi-scale prediction network (MSPN) to accurately regress the vehicle shape and classify vehicle fine-grained categories. In addition, the feature maps from the CMRN are merged with their corresponding upsampled features from the MSPN using concatenation.

It is challenging for a system-level optimisation to deal with while empirically maintaining quality of service. The 5G load balancing aims to address this problem by transferring the extra traffic from a high-load cell to its neighbouring idle cells. In recent literature, controller and machine learning algorithms are applied to assist the self-optimising and proactive schemes in drawing load balancing decisions. However, these algorithms lack the ability of forecasting upcoming high traffic demands, especially during popular events. This shortage leads to cold-start problems because of reacting to the changes in the heterogeneous dense deployment. Notably, the hotspots corresponding with skew load distribution will result in low convergence speed. To address these problems, this paper contributes to three aspects. Firstly, urban event detection is proposed to forecast the changes in cellular hotspots based on Twitter data for enabling context-awareness. Secondly, a proactive 5G load balancing strategy is simulated considering the prediction of the skewed-distributed hotspots in urban areas. Finally, we optimise this context-aware proactive load balancing strategy by forecasting the best activation time.

Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of the traffic passenger flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed traffic, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban traffic passenger flows in different transportation lines, a more efficient and fine-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model the passenger flows among different traffic lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical traffic data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction.

There are several policies for reducing air pollution regarding industry, energy, transportation, and agriculture. Unfortunately, there is limited monitoring of the air quality in cities and rural areas for supervising the accomplishment of these policies. Reliable monitoring of air pollutants is, typically, based on expensive fixed stations, which constitutes a barrier to tackle. This research presents the design, implementation and evaluation of a small, low-cost, station for monitoring atmospheric pollution. The prototype registers ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) using inexpensive sensors. To assure high reliability of the measurements obtained by the sensors installed in this station, it is proposed a calibration procedure based on the selection of the best performance analysis of the following machine learning techniques: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Additionally, a decision rule is implemented to select an optimal combination of sensors for the estimation models, while the sample timestamp is considered as a temporal heuristic at the input of the system, assuming similarities in the daily environmental dynamics. In order to test the station in a realistic scenario, the calibration and evaluation sets were taken in two different time frames of one and two months, respectively. The overall process was implemented with reference data coming from a certified air quality fixed station in the city of Cuenca - Ecuador. Experimental results showed that the real-time reports of ozone provided by the prototype are quite similar to the fixed station during the evaluation period, with a resulting correlation of up to r = 0.92 and r = 0.91 in the calibration and evaluation set, respectively. However, signal drift and aging in COx sensors diminished the accuracy of carbon monoxide calibration models, resulting in lower correlation (r ≤ 0.76) with the evaluation set.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035500/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Knowing the expected demand enables transit operators to deploy real-time control strategies in advance of the demand surge, and minimize the impact of abnormalities on the service quality and passenger experience. One of the most useful applications of demand prediction models in transit is in predicting the congestion on station platforms and crowding on vehicles. These require information about the origin-destination (OD) demand, providing a detailed profile of how and when passengers enter and exit the service. However, existing work in the literature is limited and overwhelmingly focuses on forecasting passenger <i>arrivals</i> at stations. This information, while useful, is incomplete for many practical applications. We address this gap by developing a scalable methodology for real-time, short-term OD demand prediction in transit systems. Our proposed model consists of three modules: multi-resolution spatial feature extraction module for capturing the local spatial dependencies with a channel-wise attention block, auxiliary information encoding module (AIE) for encoding the exogenous information, and a module for capturing the temporal evolution of demand. The OD demand at time <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, represented as a <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$N \times N$ </tex-math></inline-formula> matrix, is processed in two separate branches. In one branch we use the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the demand into its different time and frequency variations, detecting patterns that are not visible in the raw data. In the other, three convolutional neural network (CNN) layers are utilized to learn the spatial dependencies from the OD demand directly. Instead of treating each channel of the resultant transformation equally, we use a <i>squeeze-and-excitation</i> layer to weight feature maps based on their contribution to the final prediction. A Convolutional Long Short-term Memory network (ConvLSTM) is then used to capture the temporal evolution of demand. The approach is demonstrated through a case study using 2 months of Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system.

To mitigate affiliated perils requires the seismic assessment of built environments. Numerous studies emphasize that remote sensing can play a valuable role in supporting the extraction of relevant features for preevent vulnerability analysis. However, the majority of approaches operate on building level. This induces the deployment of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data, which hampers, nowadays, utilization capabilities for larger areas due to data costs and processing requirements. In this paper, we alter the spatial scale of analysis and propose concepts and methods to estimate the seismic vulnerability level of homogeneous urban structures. A procedure is designed, which comprises four main steps dedicated to: 1) delineation of urban structures by means of a tailored unsupervised data segmentation procedure with scale optimization; 2) characterization of urban structures by a joint exploitation of multisensor data; 3) selection of most feasible features under consideration of in situ vulnerability information; and 4) estimation of seismic vulnerability levels of urban structures within a supervised learning framework. We render the prediction problem in three ways to address operational requirements that can evolve in real-life situations. 1) To discriminate two or more classes based on labeled samples of all classes present in the data under investigation, we use the framework of soft margin support vector machines (C-SVM). 2) To consider situations, where solely labeled samples are available for the class(es) of interest and not for all classes present in the data, we deploy ensembles of ν-one-class SVM (ν-OC-SVM). and 3) To fit data with a higher statistical level of measurement (interval or ratio scale), we utilize a support vector regression (SVR) approach to estimate a regression function from the training samples. Experimental results are obtained for the earthquake-prone mega city Istanbul, Turkey. We use multispectral data from the RapidEye constellation, elevation measurements from the TanDEM-X mission, and spatiotemporal analyses based on data from the Landsat archive to characterize the urban environment. In addition, different in situ data sets are incorporated for Istanbul's district Zeytinburnu and the residual settlement area of Istanbul. When estimating damage grades for Zeytinburnu with SVR, best models are characterized by mean absolute percentage errors less than 11%, and fairly strong goodness of fit (R > 0.75). When aiming to identify different types of urban structures for the remaining settlement area of Istanbul (i.e., urban structures determined by large industrial/commercial buildings and tall detached residential buildings, which can be considered here as highly and slightly vulnerable, respectively), results obtained with C-SVM show a distinctive increase of accuracy compared to results obtained with ensembles of ν-OC-SVM. The latter were not able to exceed moderate agreements, with κ statistics slightly above 0.45. Instead, C-SVM allowed obtaining ν statistics expressing substantial and even excellent agreements (κ > 0.6 up to κ > 0.8).

Among these events, urban flash floods are particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur, and because of the population density of cities.

However, no dedicated flash flood sensing systems, that could monitor the propagation of flash floods, in real time, currently exist in cities. In this paper, first, a new sensing device that can simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and traffic congestion has been presented. This sensing device is based on the combination of ultrasonic range finding with remote temperature sensing, and can sense both phenomena with a high degree of accuracy, using a combination of L1-regularized reconstruction and artificial neural networks to process measurement data. Second, corresponding algorithms have been implemented on a low-power wireless sensor platform, and their performance in water level estimation in a six months test involving four different sensors is illustrated.

On the other hand, computer vision as a crucial bridge between urban world and artificial intelligence is playing a key role in urban computing and intelligence. Conventional particle filter is derived from Karman filter, which theoretically based on Monte Carlo method. Sequential importance resampling (SIR) is implemented in conventional particle filter to avoid the degeneracy problem. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the resampling algorithm in the traditional particle filter, we proposed an optimized particle filter using the maximum variance weight segmentation resampling algorithm in this paper, which improved the performance of particle filter. Compared with the traditional particle filter algorithm, the experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms in terms of computational consumption and the accuracy of particle tracking.

In addition to urban context features constructed from multi-source urban data, we learn the latent representations of users, origin-destination (OD) pairs and transportation modes based on user implicit feedbacks, which captures the collaborative transportation mode preferences of users and OD pairs. Moreover, we propose two models to recommend the proper route among various uni-modal and multi-modal transportation routes: (1) a light-weight gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) based recommendation model; and (2) a multi-task wide and deep learning (MTWDL) based recommendation model.

It can significantly reduce the sensing cost while ensuring high data quality. Recently, large urban sensing systems often require multiple types of sensing data (e.g., publish two tasks on temperature and humidity respectively) to form a multi-dimensional urban sensing map. These multiple types of sensing data hold some inherent correlations, which can be leveraged to further reduce the sensing cost and improve the accuracy of the inferred results. In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional urban sensing in sparse MCS to jointly address the data inference and cell selection for multi-task scenarios. We exploit the intra- and inter-task correlations in data inference to deduce the data of the unsensed cells through the multi-task compressive sensing and then learn and select the most effective 〈cell, task〉 pairs by using reinforcement learning. To effectively capture the intra- and inter-task correlations in cell selection, we design a network structure with multiple branches, where branches extract the intra-task correlations for each task, respectively, and then catenates the results from all branches to capture the inter-task correlations among the multiple tasks. In addition, we present a two-stage online framework for reinforcement learning in practical use, including training and running phases.

In this work, a new visual-based algorithm for identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZ) in crowded scenarios is proposed, considering a camera mounted on a UAV, where the people in the scene move with unknown dynamics. To do so, a density map is generated for each image frame using a Deep Neural Network, from where a binary occupancy map is obtained aiming to overestimate the people's location for security reasons. Then, the occupancy map is projected to the head's plane, and the SLZ candidates are obtained as circular regions with a minimum security radius, within the head's plane. Finally, to keep track of the SLZ candidates, a multiple instance tracking algorithm is implemented using Kalman Filters along with the Hungarian algorithm for data association. Several scenarios were studied to prove the validity of the proposed strategy, including public datasets and real uncontrolled scenarios with people moving in public squares, taken from a UAV in flight.

Since most existing approaches mainly consider the general vehicle appearance for reidentification while overlooking the distinct vehicle identifier, such as the license plate number, they attain suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose PROVID, a PROgressive Vehicle re-IDentification framework based on deep neural networks. In particular, our framework not only utilizes the multimodality data in large-scale video surveillance, such as visual features, license plates, camera locations, and contextual information, but also considers vehicle reidentification in two progressive procedures: coarse-to-fine search in the feature domain, and near-to-distant search in the physical space. Furthermore, to evaluate our progressive search framework and facilitate related research, we construct the VeRi dataset, which is the most comprehensive dataset from real-world surveillance videos. It not only provides large numbers of vehicles with varied labels and sufficient cross-camera recurrences but also contains license plate numbers and contextual information.

Navigating larger cities on a bike is, however, often challenging due to the cities' fragmented cycling infrastructure and/or complex terrain topology. Cyclists would thus benefit from intelligent route planning that would help them discover routes that best suit their transport needs and preferences. Because of the many factors cyclists consider in deciding their routes, employing a multicriteria route search is vital for properly accounting for cyclists' route-choice criteria. A direct application of optimal multicriteria route search algorithms is, however, not feasible due to their prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we formalize a multicriteria bicycle routing problem and propose several heuristics for speeding up the multicriteria route search. We evaluate our method on a real-world cycleway network and show that speedups of up to four orders of magnitude over the standard multicriteria label-setting algorithm are possible with a reasonable loss of solution quality.

Many existing studies on traffic speed prediction are based on convolutional neural networks, and these have primarily focused on capturing the spatial proximity among different road segments. However, the real cause of the spread of traffic congestion is the connectivity of these road segments, rather than their spatial proximity. This makes it very challenging to improve prediction accuracy. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), the connectivity of these road segments can be modeled as a graph in which the properties of road segments and the connections between them are embedded as the properties of the nodes and edges, respectively. This paper describes a novel approach that combines the advantages of sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and GNNs. Specifically, the evolution of traffic conditions on road networks is modeled as a sequence of graphs. Thus, the proposed SeqGNN model represents both the inputs and outputs as graph sequences.

The strong heterogeneity of urban areas poses a big challenge for accurate near realtime flood mapping. However, previous studies on automatic methods for urban flood mapping perform infeasible in near realtime or fail to generalize well to other floods, for several reasons. First, multitemporal pixel-wise flood mapping requires accurate image registration, hindering the efficiency of large-scale processing. Although automatic image registration has been investigated, precisely coregistered multitemporal image sequence requires time-consuming fine tuning. Additionally, the floods may lead to the loss of many corresponding image points across multitemporal images for accurate coregistration. Second, existing unsupervised methods generally rely on hand-crafted features for floodwater detection. Such features may not well represent the patterns of floodwaters in different areas due to inconsistent weather conditions, illumination, and floodwater spectra. This article proposes a self-supervised learning framework for patch-wise urban flood mapping using bitemporal multispectral satellite imagery. Patch-wise change vector analysis is used with patch features learned through a self-supervised autoencoder to produce patch-wise change maps showing potentially flood-affected areas. Postprocessing including spectral and spatial filtering is applied to these patch-wise change maps to remove nonflood related changes. Final flood maps and parameter sensitivities were evaluated using several performance metrics. Two flood events from areas with differing degrees of urbanization were considered: Hurricane Harvey flood (2017) in Houston, Texas, and Hurricane Florence flood (2018) in Lumberton, North Carolina.

Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator.

Accurate forecasting will guarantee that electrical equipments such as electric traction systems for trains work under safe, robust and efficient status. Recently, many studies adopt the learning-based methods to achieve the prediction of power demand. However, most of the studies use the traditional classification or clustering algorithms which may not satisfy the requirements of accuracy and efficiency due to the complex features in smart grid. In this paper, we focus on solving the power demand forecasting problem based on deep learning structures. We first propose a deep learning based framework for power demand forecasting with Deep Belief Network (DBN). Then, we use an algorithm called Adaboost to combine weak learners with strong learners, which can increase the accuracy significantly in real-world scenarios. The prediction of the load status is realized by analyzing the information of historical distribution transformer load, weather, electricity population and some other related information. It is also worth noting that the training process of these DBN networks can be parallel, which effectively shorten the processing time and provide the possible of real-time predicting.

Vehicular networks have the potential to become one of the important carriers of future mobile networks. The performance of current vehicular networks has been widely evaluated through simulation experiments due to the high cost and impracticality of other experimental approaches. The most paramount factors of vehicle networks are the authenticity of simulative evaluation, where the mobility of the vehicles is the first significant feature (i.e., the nodes of the vehicular network) that must be properly considered. However, generating the corresponding real mobility datasets has always been a big challenge although it is vital to the simulations of vehicular networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a learning-based generation method that can be used to build the vehicle-trajectory data for variety of vehicle densities. Firstly, with analyzing the road bayonet data, we obtain the hidden pattern between road traffic and time. Secondly, we deploy Vissim (a well-known traffic simulator) to generate the experimental data by considering the urban functional areas for the origins of vehicles. The generated experimental data are learned by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and the weight matrix of the parameters is obtained, which presents the impact of the experimental parameters on the simulation results.

However, these efforts were focused on close-range objects and only a very few of the deep learning-based methods were specifically designed for large-scale 3D urban reconstruction due to the lack of multi-view aerial image benchmarks. In this paper, we present a synthetic aerial dataset, called the WHU dataset, we created for MVS tasks, which, to our knowledge, is the first large-scale multi-view aerial dataset. It was generated from a highly accurate 3D digital surface model produced from thousands of real aerial images with precise camera parameters. We also introduce in this paper a novel network, called RED-Net, for wide-range depth inference, which we developed from a recurrent encoder-decoder structure to regularize cost maps across depths and a 2D fully convolutional network as framework. RED-Net's low memory requirements and high performance make it suitable for large-scale and highly accurate 3D Earth surface reconstruction. Our experiments confirmed that not only did our method exceed the current state-of-the-art MVS methods by more than 50% mean absolute error (MAE) with less memory and computational cost, but its efficiency as well. It outperformed one of the best commercial software programs based on conventional methods, improving their efficiency 16 times over.

Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction. If it is not solved, it will easily lead to zero-expansion problems, leading to inaccurate prediction results. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a space-gated memory network (SGMN) based on deep learning. The model combines real-time accident risk, real-time traffic flow, and real-time weather with multiple inputs to predict sub-regions with high accident risk. In order to verify the performance of the model, two real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Reducing traffic accidents is an important problem for increasing public safety, so accident analysis and prediction have been a subject of extensive research in recent time. Even if a traffic hazard occurs, a readily deployable structure with an accurate prediction of accident can contribute to better management of rescue resources. But the significant shortcomings of current studies are the use of small-scale datasets with minimal scope, being based on extensive data sets, and not being applicable for real-time purposes.

For urban dwellers, few things are more irritating than anxiously searching for a parking space. Research results show that as much as 30% of traffic is caused by drivers driving around looking for parking spaces in congested city areas. There has been considerable activity among researchers to develop smart technologies that can help drivers find a parking spot with greater ease, not only reducing traffic congestion but also the subsequent air pollution. Many existing solutions deploy sensors in every parking spot to address the automatic parking spot detection problems. However, the device and deployment costs are very high, especially for some large and old parking structures. A wide variety of other technological innovations are beginning to enable more adaptable systems-including license plate number detection, smart parking meter, and vision-based parking spot detection. In this paper, we propose to design a more adaptable and affordable smart parking system via distributed cameras, edge computing, data analytics, and advanced deep learning algorithms. Specifically, we deploy cameras with zoom-lens and motorized head to capture license plate numbers by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot; cameras with wide angle fish-eye lens will monitor the large parking lot via our custom designed deep neural network. We further optimize the algorithm and enable the real-time deep learning inference in an edge device.

The License Plate Recognition task is generally a computational-intensive task, where the entire input image frame is scanned, the found plates are segmented, and character recognition is then performed.

The implementation of IoV is inseparable from Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. There have been many studies on packet delivery strategy in IoV, but most of all these studies ignore the links between the characteristics of the vehicle routing, road topology and communication. Therefore the performance of IoV communication is still not guaranteed. This paper proposes a packet delivery strategy based on deep reinforcement learning in IoV, which considers vehicles position, topology, the successful delivery ratio, congestion probability and the life cycle of packets. Firstly, we establish and optimize the packet delivery model. Then, based on the deep reinforcement learning method, we propose our packet delivery strategy. We also design and realize the packet delivery system in IoV with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) to obtain the real movement model of vehicles. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of our strategy compared to existing methods in packet delivery.

However, there are only a few air monitoring stations in a city, which make it difficult to precisely measure PM2.5 concentration at the place without installation of air monitor. In this paper, we consider the PM2.5 inference problem and propose a model taking the PM2.5 nonlinear characteristic into account based on support vector machine (SVM). We collect the features of meteorology, geographical locations and PM2.5 indexes observed by air monitoring stations. Unlike the previous work, we add points of interest (POIs) feature and reduce its dimension by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model due to its sparsity and adopt wavelet decomposition to improve the inference accuracy.

In the context of urban transportation networks of growing complexity, the management of non-recurrent road traffic events, estimated to account for close to 50% of the total travel-time delay on road networks, requires advanced predictive methods, supporting both response plan deployment and traveller information. In this work, we consider the problem of predicting how a non-recurrent traffic event, such as a road incident, impacts traffic conditions at the incident location in the future. Based on a detailed statistical analysis of a large dataset of traffic incidents, we propose a parametric piecewise-affine incident model. The model is calibrated offline using a combination of constrained and unconstrained non-linear regression methods, and is shown to provide a good fit. The prediction of local incident impact is achieved via the design of a neural network model learning the parametric fit of the incident model based on available incident features. The neural network-based prediction model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art prediction methods such as multivariate decision trees. Empirical performance of the method introduced in this work is illustrated on a large dataset of more than 50000 incidents from the city of Lyon, France, for the months of September 2013 to January 2014.

10.1109/ICECET52533.2021.9698794,Anomalous energy detection for resource-constrained embedded systems using tracing data analysis,IEEE,Conferences,"Since the multi-sensor embedded systems are spread all over the urban and suburban areas, there should be a real-time performance analysis framework to monitor the energy consumption of sensors and services. To this end, applying artificial intelligence to model the behavior can play a key role in improving operational efficiency and over-consumption detection. Most of the energy over-consumption detection approaches make use of external devices such as smart plugs or designed for smart buildings rather than computing devices. Through this paper, a new architecture is proposed in which we extract real-time execution traces after identifying the suspicious running applications using the dynamic binary instrumentation technique. The output of this step is fed to a data analytic framework to detect any behavioral anomalies such as over-threshold energy consumption. Finally, depending on the decision made by the anomaly detection step, some sensors might be switched to the standby mode in order to meet the essential expectations for other sensors or services. Since we have a resource-constrained embedded system and a real-time decision-making constraint on sensor control, the amount of computation that could be done in real-time varies a lot. Accordingly, the desired performance may dictate how, when, and where the processing operations might occur (on the embedded system or on a remote server). This work is mainly focused on anomaly detection operations using tracing data analysis.

10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746507,Autonomous Driving without a Burden: View from Outside with Elevated LiDAR,IEEE,Conferences,"The current autonomous driving architecture places a heavy burden in signal processing for the graphics processing units (GPUs) in the car. This directly translates into battery drain and lower energy efficiency, crucial factors in electric vehicles. This is due to the high bit rate of the captured video and other sensing inputs, mainly due to Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor at the top of the car which is an essential feature in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is needed to obtain a high precision map for the vehicle AI to make relevant decisions. However, this is still a quite restricted view from the car. This is the same even in the case of cars without a LiDAR such as Tesla. The existing LiDARs and the cameras have limited horizontal and vertical fields of visions. In all cases it can be argued that precision is lower, given the smaller map generated. This also results in the accumulation of a large amount of data in the order of several TBs in a day, the storage of which becomes challenging. If we are to reduce the effort for the processing units inside the car, we need to uplink the data to edge or an appropriately placed cloud. However, the required data rates in the order of several Gbps are difficult to be met even with the advent of 5G. Therefore, we propose to have a coordinated set of LiDAR's outside at an elevation which can provide an integrated view with a much larger field of vision (FoV) to a centralized decision making body which then sends the required control actions to the vehicles with a lower bit rate in the downlink and with the required latency.

Simulations carried out using a realistic antenna array radiation pattern, as well as, data from a ray tracing channel model in a dense urban mmWave deployment show that the proposed multiuser scheduler has remarkably good performance, while its algorithmic complexity is kept low. We further quantify the improvements that our SVM-based beam management methods enable by comparison against the conventional exhaustive beam sweeping approach typically employed by 5G NR mmWave implementations.

It involves knowledge about the purpose of urban design, behaviors of users and needs in terms of mobility. We believe that in the near future, decision makers will have to react and more frequently adapt public policies, based on the huge amount of available data, feedbacks from both target users and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a generic agent-based architecture to model and simulate urban policies, which could facilitate the co-design and assessment of public policies in a specific environment. Two agent-based models are coupled with a micromacro dynamic loop, and they can be adapted either by the system using reinforcement learning, or by the stakeholders using simulation results. A generic formalism is elaborated to represent urban policies, which can be instantiated in a co-design approach between the policymaker and our system. An experimentation is conducted on an urban mobility policy, related to the configuration of parking price system in downtown area. The agent’s behavior and environment are developed to be as realistic as possible, based on a real-world source of modeling. However, our architecture has been designed to be generic, exploiting infrastructure data from any city using available community data (Open Street Map). The scenario of parking pricing shows that the system learns postpolicy behaviors and can propose some adjustments (e.g., specific actions to apply, when and how) to better meet the stakeholders’ objectives (e.g., maximize parking gains).

Town councils have to regularly collect different types of wastes to clean cities/towns. Hence managing the waste of the cities is a challenging task. However, most of the urban councils currently use a manual approach to managing waste. However, it results in many difficulties for the people and cleaning staff who involve in the process by following strict guidelines. Issues due to waste contamination, no proper information management of waste collection, and no punctuality in removing waste from the garbage bins are some of the significant issues arising from the manual process. Due to the drawbacks of the manual approach, social issues, environmental issues, health issues can occur easily. This paper proposes a better solution to replace this manual system with an automated system to overcome these issues. Hence, the main objective of this research is to introduce an ICT-based innovative design that can be used to develop an effective waste management system in town councils.

Due to the complexity of the urban geographic structure and the highly nonlinear temporal and spatial dependence on crowd flow, accurate forecasting becomes very challenging. Recent research works usually divided cities into regions of the same size and coded as heat-maps, for cities with complex terrain, heat-maps contain many invalid data, which have a negative effect on the acquisition of spatial dependence. In order to decrease the effect, we encode the crowd flow into graphs and propose a multi-graph neural network based model to solve the crowd flow forecasting problem. We first construct two K-NN graphs by the Euclidean distance and the Pearson correlation coefficient respectively and the spatial dependence is captured through the spatial block composed of Graph Attention Networks(GAT) and ChebNet, then another ChebNet is deployed to fuse the spatial dependency of the two graphs. Afterward, we adapted a LSTM to capture the temporal dependence of all regions separately and use self-attention mechanism and fully connected layer to (a) the receptive filed of CNN's filget prediction results.

EV charging station availability prediction is one of the traffic facilities usage forecasting challenges in the urban planning. With the accurate long-term prediction of each EV charging station availability, drivers could schedule the charging activities wisely and avoid range anxiety. Data driven models are commonly applied to deal with the similar questions. However, due to the complex charging station distribution with topological road network structure and time-variant charging station availability, many widely used algorithms, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), could only extract the pure time-series information during the model training. One direct effect is that the prediction accuracy decreases rapidly over time. The Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) that consists the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) considering edge connectivity and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed to process both spatial and temporal dependence of relevant transportation data in this paper.

Therefore, one GIS-based multi-model system for risk assessment of geological hazards by using Visual Basic 6.0 and secondary development modules of MAPGIS was illustrated in this paper; moreover this system had been applied to the Project of Risk Assessment of Geological Hazards of Central Henan Urban Agglomeration. This system combines the advanced function of GIS spatial analysis with mathematical assessment models and the techniques of software integration development.

It provides users with 5 different models: exponential-weighted model, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, extension matter-element comprehensive evaluation model, spatial information model and artificial neural network model. Thus, user can select multiple models to evaluate one specific hazard and compare respectively different results. 2. It facilitates risk assessment of varied hazards through establishing different assessment index system in an interactive way. 3. It supplies user with updating the spatial database real-timely. 4.

To overcome this challenge and support the deployment of robots in real world scenarios, we propose a complete solution for a dynamic object aware LiDAR SLAM algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging a real-time capable neural network that can detect dynamic objects, thus allowing our system to deal with them explicitly. To efficiently generate the necessary training data which is key to our approach, we present a novel end-to-end occupancy grid based pipeline that can automatically label a wide variety of arbitrary dynamic objects. Our solution can thus generalize to different environments without the need for expensive manual labeling and at the same time avoids assumptions about the presence of a predefined set of known objects in the scene. Using this technique, we automatically label over 12000 LiDAR scans collected in an urban environment with a large amount of pedestrians and use this data to train a neural network, achieving an average segmentation IoU of 0.82.

This paper proposes a novel concept of queue length based MFD (QMFD) considering the fact that queue length is usually regarded as an important index to evaluate the efficiency of intersections. Compared to traditional MFD, the QMFD can reflect the traffic status more intuitively and can be understood more easily by transportation managers and residents. However, the queue length of some links may not be obtained directly in real situations if no fixed detector is available. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a floating car data (FCD) based method to estimate the QMFD. Firstly, a new queue length estimation method is developed by using BP neural network with different floating car percentage. Secondly, based on the estimated queue length, QMFD is calculated by fitting the relationship between the average queue length and other macroscopic traffic parameters such as average flow at intersections. Finally, the proposed method is verified by the traffic data provided by traffic simulation software VISSIM with the real road networks of Beijing's Second Ring Road.

To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose an indoor MR height estimation framework, namely IFLoc, via a machine learning model. IFLoc first builds a training MR database via a pre-processing step to comfortably tag raw MR samples by precisely inferred height from auxiliary data such as GPS and barometer readings. Next, IFLoc trains a regression model for height estimation by a set of developed techniques including 3D space division, post-processing techniques, feature augmentation and an improved SVR (Supported Vector Regression) model.

Now the GPS positioning technology is very mature and is developing towards high-precision and high-reliability technology. However, the stability of GPS needs to be improved. This paper uses RTK (Real Time Kinematic) real -time dynamic differential positioning technology that can improve GPS accuracy, as well as basic simple inertial navigation components such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetic compasses as GPS. Compensation during interruption improves the reliability of GPS positioning. However, the error of the long-term inertial navigation system accumulates over time, which seriously affects the navigation accuracy, and the accuracy of the simple sensor output is not high. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network-like learning scheme that uses LSTM to achieve high-precision and reliable positioning.

Currently, most autonomous vehicles rely on preconstructed lane maps as designing an algorithmic model is difficult. However, the generation and maintenance of such maps is costly and hinders large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. This paper presents the first self-supervised learning method to train a model to infer a spatially grounded lane-level road network graph based on a dense segmented representation of the road scene generated from onboard sensors. A formal road lane network model is presented and proves that any structured road scene can be represented by a directed acyclic graph of at most depth three while retaining the notion of intersection regions, and that this is the most compressed representation. The formal model is implemented by a hybrid neural and search-based model, utilizing a novel barrier function loss formulation for robust learning from partial labels.

Current research still cannot guarantee a perfect perception, and failure detections may cause collisions, leading to untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. This work proposes a trajectory planner to tolerate the detection failure of the LiDAR sensors. This method will plan the path relying on the detected objects as well as the raw sensor data. The overlapping and contradiction of both perception routes will be carefully addressed for safe and efficient driving. The object detector in this work uses a deep learning-based method, i.e., CNN-Segmentation neural network. The designed trajectory planner has multi-layers to handle the multi-resolution environment formed by different perception routes. The final system will dynamically adjust its attention to the detected objects or the point cloud to avoid collision due to detection failures. This method is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle to drive in an open urban area. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle fails to detect a surrounding object, e.g., vehicles or some undefined objects, the autonomous vehicles still can plan an efficient and safe trajectory. In the meantime, when the perception system works well, the A V will not be affected by the point clouds. This technology can make the autonomous vehicle trustworthy even with the black-box neural networks.

10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795970,License plate recognition based on temporal redundancy,IEEE,Conferences,"Recognition of vehicle license plates is an important task in several real applications. Most approaches first detect a vehicle, locate the license plate and then recognize its characters. However, the focus relies on performing these tasks using only a single frame of each vehicle in the video. Therefore, such approaches might have their recognition rates reduced due to noise present in that particular frame. Instead of selecting a single frame to perform the recognition, we propose a novel real-time approach to automatically detect the vehicle and identify (locate/recognize) its license plate based on temporal redundancy information. To achieve further improvements, we also propose two post-processing techniques by querying a license plate database. The experimental results, performed in a dataset composed of 300 on-track vehicles acquired on an urban road, demonstrate that it is possible to improve the vehicle recognition rate in 15:3 percentage points using our proposal temporal redundancy approach. Additional 7:8 percentage points are achieved by querying registered license plates on a database by the vehicle appearance, leading to a final recognition rate of 89:6%.

The model is designed to run for long periods of time (weeks to months) on low-cost hardware, used in a noise monitoring network, and builds upon previous work by the same authors. It consists of three neural layers, connected to each other by feedforward and feedback excitatory connections. It is shown that the different mechanisms that drive auditory attention emerge naturally from the way in which neural activation and intra-layer inhibitory connections are implemented in the model. Training of the artificial neural network is done following the Hebb principle, dictating that ""Cells that fire together, wire together"", with some important modifications, compared to standard Hebbian learning. As the model is designed to be on-line for extended periods of time, also learning mechanisms need to be adapted to this. The learning needs to be strongly attention- and saliency-driven, in order not to waste available memory space for sounds that are of no interest to the human listener. The model also implements plasticity, in order to deal with new or changing input over time, without catastrophically forgetting what it already learned. On top of that, it is shown that also the implementation of short-term memory plays an important role in the long-term learning properties of the model.

10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762398,MRIM: Enabling Mixed-Resolution Imaging for Low-Power Pervasive Vision Tasks,IEEE,Conferences,"While many pervasive computing applications increasingly utilize real-time context extracted from a vision sensing infrastructure, the high energy overhead of DNN-based vision sensing pipelines remains a challenge for sustainable in-the-wild deployment. One common approach to reducing such energy overheads is the capture and transmission of lower-resolution images to an edge node (where the DNN inferencing task is executed), but this results in an accuracy-vs-energy tradeoff, as the DNN inference accuracy typically degrades with a drop in resolution. In this work, we introduce MRIM, a simple but effective framework to tackle this tradeoff. Under MRIM, the vision sensor platform first executes a lightweight preprocessing step to determine the saliency of different sub-regions within a single captured image frame, and then performs a saliency-aware non-uniform downscaling of individual sub-regions to produce a &#x201C;mixed-resolution&#x201D; image. We describe two novel low-complexity algorithms that the sensor platform can use to quickly compute suitable resolution choices for different regions under different energy/accuracy constraints.

10.23919/SPA.2019.8936736,Machine Learning for Embodied Agents: From Signals to Symbols and Actions,IEEE,Conferences,"The aim of this tutorial lecture is to show the role of machine learning and some other AI-related techniques in embodied autonomous agents, and autonomous robots in particular. In this tutorial we bring to the forefront the aspects of robotics that are closely related to computer science. We believe that the progress in algorithms and data processing methods together with the rapid increase in the available computing power were the driving forces behind the successes of modern robotics in the last decade. During this period robots of various classes migrated from university laboratories to commercial companies and then to our everyday life, as now everybody can buy an autonomous vacuum cleaner or lawnmower, while self-driving cars and drones for goods delivery are waiting for proper legal regulations to enter the market. Robotics and Artificial Intelligence already went a long path of mutual inspiration and common development, starting from the symbolic AI (aka Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and its extensive use in early autonomous robots, such as Shakey the robot, created in SRI International by Nils Nilsson, considered one of the ""fathers"" of modern AI. We briefly characterize the range of the most important applications of typical AI methods in modern robotics, including motion planning algorithms [2,3], interpretation of sensory data leading to creation of a world model [4 ,5], and classical learning methods, such as reinforcement learning [6]. However, what made robotics a part of the new wave of AI applications was the recent ""revolution"" of machine learning, mostly grounded in the enormous success of the deep learning paradigm and its many variants that proved to outclass classic methods in a broad range of problems related to the processing of images and other types of signals. The quick adoption of the recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) in robotics seems to be motivated by the fact that ML gives the possibility to infer solutions from data, as opposed to the classic model-based paradigm that was for decades used in robotics. Whereas the modelbased solutions are mathematically elegant and theoretically provable (with respect to stability, convergence, etc.) they often fail once confronted with real-world problems and real sensory data, as their underlying mathematical models are only a very rough approximation of the real world. Therefore, a wider adoption of ML in robotics gives a chance to make robots more robust and adaptive. On the other hand, we should try to use the new techniques without discarding the knowledge and expertise we already have - machine learning methods can benefit a lot from the prior knowledge and the known structure of the problem that has to be solved by learning. This knowledge and structure can be adopted from the model-based methods that a re already well-established in robotics. In the lecture robots are understood in a broad sense, as all embodied agents that have means to physically interact with the environment. They can be either manipulators, mobile robots, aerial vehicles, self-driving cars, and various ""smart"" devices and sensors. In the second part of the lecture attention is paid to specific problems that appear in application of machine learning to embodied agents, such as the need to search a for solution in huge, multi-dimensional spaces (""curse of dimensionality""), and the ever-present problem of representation and incorporation of uncertainty in the processing of real-world data. Some examples of applications of autonomous robots are given, which were successful due to the use of AI - in particular the probabilistic representation of knowledge and machine learning. The most prominent examples are the DARPA competitions: ""Grand Challenge"", ""Urban Challenge"" and ""Robotics Challenge"" (DRC), and the ""Amazon Picking Challenge"", which proves the interest of large corporations in the development of AI-based robotics [7]. In the third part of the lecture new research directions offered by machine learning and the increased availability of training data are discussed. An overview of the most popular application areas of ML in robotics and other autonomous systems is presented along with the typical machine learning paradigms applied in these areas. The focus is on deep learning, mostly using convolutional neural networks to process various sensory data. We discuss three aspects of embodied agents that make machine learning in robotics quite specific with respect to other application areas, such as medical images or natural language processing. The first aspect is dealing with the ""open world"", in which autonomous robots usually operate. This situation breaks the assumptions underlying some popular ML methods, and creates the need to face the problem of unknown classes identification [8] incremental learning [9], and the uncertainty of sensory data [10]. We also stress out that an embodied agent has the ability to actively acquire information [11]. The second aspect is the inference about the scene seen by the agent, where in the case of robotics, semantics and geometry intermingle [12], because the robot has to work in a three-dimensional world, although it often perceives it through twodimensional images [13,14]. The third aspect of our analysis is related to the most important feature of robots that distinguishes them from all other learning agents (software-based). Robots are embodied agents, that is they have a physical ""body"", and are subject to physical constraints, such as the maximum speed of motion or maximum range of perception. Therefore, in ML for robots analysis of the spatio-temporal dependencies in data is very important [15]. Robots support advanced learning methods thanks to the possibility of interaction with the environment - a simple example is active vision with moving camera, a much more complex one is manipulation with active testing of the behavior of objects (repositioning, pushing) [16]. At the end of the lecture, in the context of specific needs and limitations characteristic to the applications of ML in robotics, new concepts of machine learning (e.g. deep reinforcement learning [17], interactive perception [18]) are presented. The lecture is summarized with a brief discussion of the most important challenges and open problems of ML applied to embodied agents.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936736/,"2019 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)",18-20 Sept. 2019,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In addition, Autonomous Vehicles accelerate people and cargo transportation, as well as reducing human errors.

Current methods of monitoring pest outbreaks involve field, aerial and remote sensing surveys. These methods only provide partial spatial coverage and can detect outbreaks only after they have substantially progressed across wide geographic areas. This paper presents an IoT system for real-time insect infestation detection using bioacoustic recognition via machine learning techniques. Specifically, we focus on detecting the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB), which is the most destructive insect of mature pines in western North American forests. We present the design of the system and describe its various hardware and software components.

Although the development of outdoor recognition systems has been a topic of interest for a while, most works have been limited in geographic coverage due to lack of high quality image data that can be used for training site recognition engines. As a result, prior systems usually lack generality and operate on a limited scope of pre-elected sites. In this work we design a mobile system that can automatically recognise sites of interest and project relevant information to a user that navigates the city. We build a collection of notable sites using Wikipedia and then exploit online services such as Google Images and Flickr to collect large collections of crowd-sourced imagery describing those sites. These images are then used to train minimal deep learning architectures that can be effectively deployed to dedicated applications on mobile devices. By conducting an evaluation and performing a series of online and real-world experiments, we recognise a number of key challenges in deploying site recognition system and highlight the importance of incorporating mobile contextual information to facilitate the visual recognition task. The similarity in the feature maps of objects that undergo identification, the presence of noise in crowd-sourced imagery and arbitrary user induced inputs are among the factors the impede correct classification for deep learning models. We show how curating the training data through the application of a class-specific image de-noising method and the incorporation of information such as user location, orientation and attention patterns can allow for significant improvement in classification accuracy and the election of an end-to-end system that can effectively be used to recognise sites in the wild.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162277/,2020 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM),30 June-3 July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The location category prediction, a branch of location prediction, is a vital task in a wide range of areas, including urban planning, advertising and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step Pattern-Based Embedding Model (PBEM) for predicting the next location category that user will go to. Based on the observation that some users behave frequently in a similarity pattern, a new feature termed as user cluster label is defined. In order to mine user's behavior patterns and extract the cluster label, a Category-Importance-Decay learning strategy is proposed and implemented, which provides a quantitative standard for evaluating the importance of each category. Thus, a comprehensive feature set is obtained including user, time, historical location category, text content, and user cluster label, which greatly enhances the robustness of data representation and contains more knowledge. Then the extracted feature set is fed into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in a unified framework, which improves the prediction accuracy.

Therefore it is important to consider this aspect when dealing with A implementations within a crowd system aimed at humans. In this research an initial two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) with constant stimuli psychophysical experiment is presented. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether human participants perceive crowd behaviour with a social forces model to be more realistic.

Moreover, he may not go through by every camera in the surveillance area and may appear in the same camera several times; and 2) the corresponding characteristic in multi-space of the same ID can be verified with each other.

Current polyphonic SED systems fail to model the temporal structure of sound events explicitly and instead attempt to look at which sound events are present at each audio frame. Consequently, the event-wise detection performance is much lower than the segment-wise detection performance. In this work, we propose a joint model approach to improve the temporal localization of sound events using a multi-task learning setup. The first task predicts which sound events are present at each time frame; we call this branch `Sound Event Detection (SED) model', while the second task predicts if a sound event is present or not at each frame; we call this branch `Sound Activity Detection (SAD) model'. We verify the proposed joint model by comparing it with a separate implementation of both tasks aggregated together from individual task predictions.

How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real ""Dongda-Keyuan"" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes.

Managing these signal control systems at their optimal performance has been an important research focus in traffic engineering. However, various optimization techniques and algorithms developed for adaptive signal control are less effective for real-time implementation in non-lane following heterogeneous road traffic due to the following possible reasons: erroneous demand estimation, time-expensive computations, or uncertainty of getting optimal solutions. Rather, these models work efficiently for homogeneous lane-following traffic where demand predictions are accurate. This work proposes an optimization model that minimizes the total average control delay and finds the optimal green times without any explicit demand prediction for heterogeneous non-lane following road traffic. The proposed solution approach finds the optimal green times and the cycle time in real-time, and the obtained solutions are adaptive to traffic fluctuations.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study.

This urban driving requires zero error tolerance. In order to guarantee safety requirements self-driving cars and the used software have to pass exhaustive tests under as many different conditions as possible. The more versatile the considered influences and the more thorough the tests made under those influences, the safer the car will drive under real conditions. Unfortunately, it is very time and resource intensive to record the same test set of images over and over again, every time producing, or hoping for, specific conditions; especially when using real test vehicles. This is where environment simulation comes into play. This research investigates the simulation of environmental influences which may affect the sensors used in autonomous vehicles, in particular how raindrops resting on a windshield affect cameras as they may occlude large parts of the field of view. We propose a novel method to render these raindrops using Continuous Nearest Neighbor search leveraging the benefits of R-trees. The 3D scene in front of the camera, which is generated from stereo images, reflects physically correct in these drops. This leads to near photo-realistic simulated results.

Wastewater management systems are conceived explicitly for purifying wastewater, providing clean water efficiently, but this is a hard task due to frequent and quite unpredictable fluctuations of inlet wastewater flows, arising from (random) rain water or (periodical, e.g. day-night) sewage sources, sometimes also leading to failures and outages. To ensure the quality of the clean water out above a threshold and keep the overall system operating, this paper proposes the smart wastewater intelligent management system (SWIMS). It monitors and controls inlet and outlet flows as well as the water quality and parts of the plant as a cyber-physical system (CPS), starting from an Environmental Internet of Things (EIoT) platform. The data generated from the treatment plant is collected in an information system hosted by a server together with an intelligent system that processes this information in a real-time fashion and provides the feedback for optimizing the plant to maintain a good quality of water over time. Such an intelligent system exploits deep learning approaches to control the behaviour of the wastewater treatment system through anomaly detection, supporting decision making on it. SWIMS has been implemented in a real case study deployed in Briatico, Italy.

Current industry-standard solutions use rule-based systems for planning. Although they perform reasonably well in common scenarios, the engineering complexity renders this approach incompatible with human-level performance. On the other hand, the performance of machine-learned (ML) planning solutions can be improved by simply adding more exemplar data. However, ML methods cannot offer safety guarantees and sometimes behave unpredictably. To combat this, our approach uses a simple yet effective rule-based fallback layer that performs sanity checks on an ML planner&#x0027;s decisions (e.g. avoiding collision, assuring physical feasibility). This allows us to leverage ML to handle complex situations while still assuring the safety, reducing ML planner-only collisions by 95%.

It achieves kinematically feasible predictions by casting the learning problem into the space of accelerations and steering angles - by performing action-space prediction, we can leverage valuable model knowledge. Additionally, the dimensionality of the action manifold is lower than that of the state manifold, whose intrinsically correlated states are more difficult to capture in a learned manner. For the purpose of action-space prediction, we present the simple Feed-Forward Action-Space Prediction (FFW-ASP) architecture. Then, we build on this notion and introduce the novel Self-Supervised Action-Space Prediction (SSP-ASP) architecture that outputs future environment context features in addition to trajectories.

Urban traffic is mostly controlled by signal lights, so optimum traffic management can be achieved by making strategies of the light signals according to the distribution of vehicles in the intersection. Incoming links (i.e. sections) in the intersection are regarded as players and the status of signal light (green or red) can be considered as the decisions made by players. In this way, the method is like a cooperative game combining all the decisions and evaluating a scalar cost function.

In a previous paper, we proposed a reservation-based system for alleviating traffic congestion, specifically at intersections. This paper extends our prototype implementation in several ways with the aim of making it more implementable in the real world. In particular, we 1) add the ability of vehicles to turn, 2) enable them to accelerate while in the intersection, 3) give a better sensor model and communication-efficient heuristic to our driver agent, and 4) augment their interaction capabilities with a detailed protocol such that the vehicles do not need to know anything about the intersection control policy. The use of this protocol limits the interaction of the driver agent and the intersection manager to the extent that it is a reasonable approximation of reliable wireless communication.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593,Unmanned Systems Health Analysis through Evidential Reasoning Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility. Results from the network are explainable, enabling human oversight of operational decisions. Real-time implementation enables integration into avionics systems. Further, the data-driven approach to learning relationships enables this system to adapt as information concerning unmanned systems steadily changes.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9256593/,2020 AIAA/IEEE 39th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),11-15 Oct. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The goal is to navigate safely in dense highway traffic and proceed through the defined length with the shortest time possible. The algorithm uses a dense neural network as a function approximator for the agent with discrete action space on the control level, e.g., acceleration and steering. The developed simulation environment uses the open-source traffic simulator called Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), integrated with an interface, to interact with the agent in real-time. With this tool, numerous driving and highway situations can be created and fed to the agent from which it can learn. The environment opens the opportunity to randomize and customize the other road users' behavior. Thus the experience can be more diverse, and thus the representation becomes more general.

Vehicular re-identification (ReID) technologies have become increasingly important in this context since these allow to produce insights capable of benefiting many areas. As recently, methods frequently resorted to Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially in the design of loss functions capable of improving the learning capacity of CNNs. Couple and triplet loss techniques have gained prominence, but their effectiveness depends on the mining of samples to converge properly. In this paper, we investigate a new simple approach for vehicle ReID by combining sample mining strategy and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) method to improve retrieval quality. By relying only on relatively low-dimensional deep features, we were able to obtain state-of-the-art performance on the VeRi-776 dataset in terms of mAP, HIT@1, and HIT@5 metrics, but using relatively simple CNN and ANN methods, which are feasible in CPU for real-time scenarios.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9207150/,2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),19-24 July 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, training a DCNN requires many annotated examples that are costly and difficult to create. In this work we present a method that reduces significantly the manual effort involved in the annotation of RD maps to train a DCNN for segmentation. A 40 times reduction in manual labelling effort is achieved because the annotation of each RD map includes only the class of the objects instead of drawing a polygon around the corresponding cells. The localization of the objects is performed by tracing back from the output to the input of a classification neural network. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust localization performance in complex real-world urban scenarios as observed with a low-cost automotive radar. Furthermore, we show that our approach performs similarly to DCNNs that are trained with a publicly available dataset in which localization information is provided.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9784473/,2021 18th European Radar Conference (EuRAD),5-7 April 2022,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Vehicle counting, in particular, has become a key element of vision-based intelligent traffic systems deployed across metropolitan areas. Most methods solved the vehicle counting problem under the assumption of state-of-the-art computing systems. However, large-scale deployment of such systems for multi-camera processing is very inefficient. With the recent advancement of cost-efficient Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices alongside machine learning methods developed specifically for such devices, solving the vehicle counting problem for real-time traffic analysis on IoT edge devices, and thereby facilitating its large-scale deployment have become highly favorable. In this paper, we propose a framework of vehicle counting designed specifically for IoT edge computers which follows the detection-tracking-counting (DTC) model. The proposed solution aims at addressing the multimodality of contextual dynamics in traffic scenes with a small detector model, a robust tracker and a counting process that accurately estimate both a vehicle's motion of interest and its exit time from observation areas.

Knowledge transfer from high-quality predictive models becomes feasible under the TL paradigm, enabling the generation of new proper models with few data.

Then, traditional batch learning is compared against TL based models using real traffic flow data, collected by deployed loops managed by the City Council of Madrid (Spain). In addition, we apply Online Learning (OL) techniques, where model receives an update after each prediction, in order to adapt to traffic flow trend changes and incrementally learn from new incoming traffic data. The obtained experimental results shed light on the advantages of transfer and online learning for traffic flow forecasting, and draw practical insights on their interplay with the amount of available training data at the location of interest.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9294557/,2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC),20-23 Sept. 2020,ieeexplore,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

10.1109/ISC246665.2019.9071662,Using Virtual Reality Environments to Predict Pedestrian Behaviour,IEEE,Conferences,"Pedestrian behaviour modelling and simulation play a fundamental role in reducing traffic risks and new policies implementation costs. However, representing human behaviour in this dynamic environment is not a trivial task and such models require an accurate representation of pedestrian behaviour. Virtual environments have been gaining notoriety as a behaviour elicitation tool, but it is still necessary to understand the validity of this technique in the context of pedestrian studies, as well as to create guidelines for its use. This work proposes a proper methodology for pedestrian behaviour elicitation using virtual reality environments in conjunction with surveys or questionnaires. The methodology focuses on gathering data about the subject, the context, and the action taken, as well as on analyzing the collected data to finally output a behavioural model. The resulting model can be used as a feedback signal to improve environment conditions for experiment iterations. A concrete implementation was built based on this methodology, serving as an example for future studies. A virtual reality traffic environment and two surveys were used as data sources for pedestrian crossing experiments. The subjects controlled a virtual avatar using an HTC Vive and were asked to traverse the distance between two points in a city. The data collected during the experiment was analyzed and used as input to a machine learning model capable of predicting pedestrian speed, taking into account their actions and perceptions.

This presents a huge challenge for loop closure detection technology. Using traditional loop closure detection methods to perform scene recognition is difficult to extract the appearance changes caused by time, weather, or seasonal conditions in the image and deep semantic information, and the speed of extracting image features is slow, which is difficult to meet the real-time performance of robots. Because of the success of deep convolutional neural networks(CNN), it is possible to enrich the information of image features. First of all, this paper uses the pre-trained CNN model SSE-Net to extract the deep visual appearance and semantic features of the image, and obtain the feature description vector. Then, after product quantization(PQ) and encoding, the final pair of candidate frames is quickly searched and matched to obtain the most similar pair of candidate frames and judged as a loop .

A wireless sensor network-based approach to detect car positions,IEEE,Conferences,"The global trend of increased urbanization makes space rare in city environments in general and for parking in particular. In addition, cars become bigger and often use more than one parking space. As a result neighboring parking spaces can be affected by a parked car. So, a basically free parking space might be too narrow for an arriving car depending on the arriving car's size. Therefore, means to detect car positions on parking spaces in a fine granular way are required to detect such situations and avoid inefficient parking space searches. Wireless sensor networks provide the possibility to sense the exact occupation of a parking space and potential influences on neighboring parking spaces. However, current solutions focus only on the detection if a parking space is occupied or not. In our work, we present a sensor deployment and a machine learning-based approach able to provide the mentioned more fine-granular detection level.
