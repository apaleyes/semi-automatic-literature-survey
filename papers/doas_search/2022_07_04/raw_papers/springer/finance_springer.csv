The deep learning (DL) technology is applied to the analysis of enterprise financing capacity. Firstly, the problems of enterprise development are introduced against the background of big-intelligence mobile cloud along with the current situation of innovative enterprise financing and DL neural network (NN), as well as the performance advantages of DL algorithms. Secondly, the financing capability of innovative enterprises is evaluated based on the backpropagation (BP) NN algorithm. Finally, the performance of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm is empirically analyzed, and the weight of the evaluation index of innovative enterprise financing capability is calculated. The experimental results show that the algorithm of the deep neural network (DNN) contains more hidden layers and abundant features than a shallow NN, and the feature extraction performance is better. Under the analysis of enterprise financing capability, the evaluation index of innovative enterprise financing capability is established, and the enterprise data are normalized by the maximum and minimum method, thereby facilitating the calculation of the BPNN algorithm. BPNN algorithm shows excellent performance in the training process, and the actual output value is very close to the expected value. Meanwhile, the error of the sample test is analyzed, finding that the evaluation error of the BPNN algorithm is less than 1.8%, which has high accuracy. Therefore, the BPNN algorithm can effectively evaluate the financing capability of innovative enterprises and can adapt to the financing capability evaluation of an enterprise's actual business under the background of big-intelligence mobile cloud.

The purpose is to explore the role of two important data analytics models including machine learning and deep learning in internet credit risk assessment and improve the accuracy of financial prediction. First, the problems in the current internet financial risk assessment are understood, and data of MSE (Micro small Enterprises) are chosen for analysis. Then, a feature extraction method based on machine learning is proposed to solve data redundancy and interference in enterprise credit risk assessment. Finally, to solve the data imbalance problem in the credit risk assessment system, a credit risk assessment system based on the deep learning DL algorithm is introduced, and the proposed credit risk assessment system is verified through a fusion algorithm in different models with specific enterprise data. The results show that the credit risk assessment model based on the machine learning algorithm optimizes the standard algorithm through the global optimal solution. The credit risk assessment model based on deep learning can effectively solve imbalanced data. The algorithm generalization is improved through layer-by-layer learning.

The existing algorithms, however, suffer from some major drawbacks; for example, some of these filter banks are not signal adaptive; in most of the cases the, filter computations are not efficient; moreover, the existing signal-adapted filter banks is not always optimal. To address these limitations, we propose an optimal signal matched filter bank (SMFB) to maximize the coding gain. The objective is to achieve spectral majorization and complete decorrelation of the sub-band signals. The filter bank is designed here to perfectly reconstruct only the given signal, instead of every signal from the finite energy signal space, as is typically done. These objectives are achieved by whitening the outputs of the analysis filter bank, within as well as across the channels. With these orthogonal whitened signals as inputs, the synthesis filter bank is designed to reconstruct a delayed version of the given signal. A time and order recursive least squares algorithm has been developed for the SMFB, with a single realization of the signal. The recursions of the algorithm lead to a lattice structure. Since the filter coefficients are not directly available from the lattice, a fast algorithm is developed to estimate the same using the lattice parameters. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed theory. We also present an automated real-time sleep apnea detection algorithm using SMFB which gives a $$92.27\%$$ 92.27 % accuracy, $$88.60\%$$ 88.60 % sensitivity, and $$94.31\%$$ 94.31 % specificity on a publicly available MIT PhysioNet Apnea-ECG dataset.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00034-022-02092-6,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The impacts of extreme events are vital to improving prediction accuracy. Aiming to demonstrate the crude oil price fluctuation and the impacts of external events, this paper employs the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). It decomposes the crude oil price into some constituents at various frequencies to extract a market fluctuation, a shock from extreme events and a long-term trend. The shock from extreme events is found to be the most crucial element in deciding the crude oil prices. Then we combine the iterative cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) test with the Chow test to get the structural breaks and analyze the extreme event impacts. Finally, this paper combines the structural breaks, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and the support vector machine (SVM) to make a forecast of the crude oil prices. The empirical process proves that the CEEMD-ARIMA-SVM model with structural breaks performs the best when compared with the other ARIMA-type models and SVM-type models.

It could cause serious health problems and sometimes lead to death. This paper aims to introduce a comprehensive approach that combines GIS, statistics and Machine Learning (ML) for the groundwater quality management including both water quality assessment and prediction. The performances of this approach are discussed through its application on assessing and predicting nitrate (NO_3) concentrations in the Eocene Aquifer, Palestine. Spatiotemporal records of NO_3 over the period 1982–2019 are integrated in a database and used in this research. The database includes the following factors: well depth, well use, anthropogenic on-ground activities, watersheds, soil type and land use. Geo-statistical assessment using GIS and statistical boxplots is employed to assess the variability of NO_3 concentrations and how they are affected by the independent indicators. Assessment outcomes (NO_3 distribution and the influencing factors) were used to build the Random Forest (RF) prediction model. Such model is used to predict GNC level in groundwater based on multi-influencing factors. Assessment results indicate increasing and decreasing trends of GNC in the southern and middle parts of the study area, respectively. It also provides the RF model by the main influencing factors affecting GNC in the study area which are: well depth, well use, anthropogenic on-ground activities, watersheds and land use. Results indicate that RF has an average and maximum prediction accuracy of 88.5 and 91.7%, respectively. The well depth has the highest influence on GNC. This research could support water authority decision-makers toward the adoption of sustainable groundwater protection plans in Palestine.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1134/S0097807822030162,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, the present study investigates how investors respond to announcements of new product innovations integrated with AI by non-software firms (AI-NPIs), with the prediction that they respond favorably if the firms feature a marketing department with substantial power; such firms likely possess the marketing resources and assets needed to ensure the success of AI-NPIs. An event study with a sample of 341 announcements by 77 S&P 500 firms between 2009–2018 supports this prediction. Furthermore, the relationship between marketing department power and investor response intensifies when the announcement (1) occurs in later innovation stages, (2) involves the sourcing of external innovation assets, and (3) refers to more complex innovations. These findings have both theoretical and managerial implications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11747-022-00873-8,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Short tandem repeat is the gold standard method, but has its own limitations, including being expensive and time-consuming. Deep neural networks achieve great success in the analysis of cellular images in a cost-effective way. However, because of the lack of centralized available datasets, whether or not cell line authentication can be replaced or supported by cell image classification is still a question. Moreover, the relationship between the incubation times and cellular images has not been explored in previous studies. In this study, we automated the process of the cell line authentication by using deep learning analysis of brightfield cell line images. We proposed a novel multi-task framework to identify cell lines from cell images and predict the duration of how long cell lines have been incubated simultaneously. Using thirty cell lines’ data from the AstraZeneca Cell Bank, we demonstrated that our proposed method can accurately identify cell lines from brightfield images with a 99.8% accuracy and predicts the incubation durations for cell images with the coefficient of determination score of 0.927. Considering that new cell lines are continually added to the AstraZeneca Cell Bank, we integrated the transfer learning technique with the proposed system to deal with data from new cell lines not included in the pre-trained model. Our method achieved excellent performance with a precision of 97.7% and recall of 95.8% in the detection of 14 new cell lines.

Various estimation metrics are utilized towards robust and efficient risk management frameworks, with the most prevalent among them being the Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a valuable risk-assessment approach, which offers traders, investors, and financial institutions information regarding risk estimations and potential investment insights. VaR has been adopted by the financial industry for decades, but the generated predictions lack efficiency in times of economic turmoil such as the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn affects the respective decisions. To address this challenge, a variety of well-established variations of VaR models are exploited by the financial community, including data-driven and data analytics models. In this context, this paper introduces a probabilistic deep learning approach, leveraging time-series forecasting techniques with high potential of monitoring the risk of a given portfolio in a quite efficient way.

Two models are developed: the first provides the probability of a missed payment during the next month for each customer, which is described as Missed payment prediction Long Short Term Memory model (MP-LSTM), whilst the second estimates the total monthly amount of purchases, which is defined as Purchase Estimation Prediction Long Short Term Memory model (PE-LSTM). Based on both models, a customer behavioural grouping is provided, which can be helpful for the bank’s decision-making. Both models are trained on real credit card transactional datasets. Customer behavioural scores are analysed using classical performance evaluation measures. Calibration analysis of MP-LSTM scores showed that they could be considered as probabilities of missed payments. Obtained purchase estimations were analysed using mean square error and absolute error. The MP-LSTM model was compared to four traditional well-known machine learning algorithms.

Although printed character recognition has achieved remarkable success in recent years, bank card recognition is not limited to traditional printed character recognition. There are two types of bank cards: unembossed bank cards, such as most debit cards which usually use printed characters, and embossed bank cards, such as most credit cards which mainly use raised characters. Recognition of raised characters is very challenging due to its own characteristics, and there is a lack of fast and good methods to handle it. To better recognize raised characters, we propose an effective method based on deep learning to detect and recognize bank cards in complex natural scenes. The method can accurately recognize the card number characters on embossed and unembossed bank cards. First, to break the limitation that YOLOv3 algorithm is usually used for object detection, we propose a novel approach that enables YOLOv3 to be used not only for bank card detection and classification, but also for character recognition. The CANNYLINES algorithm is used for rectification and the Scharr operator is introduced to locate the card number region. The proposed method can satisfy bank card detection, classification and character recognition in complex natural scenes, such as complex backgrounds, distorted card surfaces, uneven illumination, and characters with the same or similar color to the background. To further improve the recognition accuracy, a printed character recognition model based on ResNet-32 is proposed for the unembossed bank cards. According to the color and morphological characteristics of embossed bank cards, raised character recognition model combining traditional morphological methods and LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed for the embossed bank cards. The experimental results on the collected bank card dataset and bank card number dataset show that our proposed method can effectively detect and identify different types of bank cards. The accuracy of the detection and classification of bank cards reaches 100%. The accuracy of the raised characters recognition on the embossed bank card is 99.31%, and the accuracy of the printed characters recognition on the unembossed bank card reaches 100%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10489-021-03119-2,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the most popular and complex deep learning in finance topics is future stock prediction. The difficulty that causes the future stock forecast is that there are too many different factors that affect the amplitude and frequency of the rise and fall of stocks at the same time. Some of the company-specific factors that can affect the share price like news releases on earnings and profits, future estimated earnings, the announcement of dividends, introduction of a new product or a product recall, secure a new large contract, employee layoffs, a major change of management, anticipated takeover or merger, and accounting errors or scandals. Furthermore, these factors are only company factors, and other factors affect the future trend of stocks, such as industry performance, investor sentiment, and economic factors. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach to predict future stock movement. The model employs a blending ensemble learning method to combine two recurrent neural networks, followed by a fully connected neural network. In our research, we use the S&P 500 Index as our test case. Our experiments show that our blending ensemble deep learning model outperforms the best existing prediction model substantially using the same dataset, reducing the mean-squared error from 438.94 to 186.32, a 57.55% reduction, increasing precision rate by 40%, recall by 50%, F 1-score by 44.78%, and movement direction accuracy by 33.34%, respectively.

We employ stacked generalization and boosted trees, two of the most powerful machine learning tools in terms of predictive power, to examine a large data set on start-ups, venture capital funds and financing transactions. We find that the size of financing rounds is mainly associated with the characteristics of the firms being financed and with the features of the countries in which the firms are headquartered. Cross-country differences in the degree of development of the venture capital industry, while highly correlated with the size of funding rounds, are not significant once we control for other country-level characteristics. We discuss how our findings contribute to the debate about policy interventions aimed at stimulating start-up financing.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00181-021-02066-8,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The filter banks approach has been mainly used for feature representation. The hybridization in filter banks is primarily generated by a fusion of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) filters. Currently, the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has taken a significant step for improving the classification compared to other learning, though the feature learning mechanism of DCNN is not definite. We have used the cascaded linear convolutional network for 3D face classification using a composite filter-based network named PICANet. The networks consist of different layers: convolutional layer, nonlinear processing layer, pooling layer, and classification layer. The main advantage of these networks over DCNN is that the network structure is simple and computationally efficient. We have tested the proposed system on three accessible 3D face databases: Frav3D, GavabDB, and Casia3D. Considering different faces in Frav3D, GavabDB, and Casia3D, the system acquired 96.93%, 87.7%, and 89.21% recognition rates using the proposed hybrid network.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11063-022-10761-5,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We develop a Dynamic Network Data Envelopment Analysis (DNDEA) model formed by three consecutive stages— profit sheet , balance sheet , and financial health efficiency—to assess how market structure and competition impact bank efficiency in European countries. Unlike previous research, a Robust Econometric-Neural Network Approach (RENNA) is used to unveil endogeneity among bank competition, market structure, and overall efficiency scores in European banking. Consistent with the competition-efficiency hypothesis, findings reveal that competition positively affects bank efficiency, particularly its balance sheet dimension. While macroeconomic factors are robust determinants of efficiency for non-GIIPS banks, Bank Z-score is far more relevant in the GIIPS subsample (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain). Furthermore, we find only weak evidence of feedback among the variables across subsamples.

Within its institutions, continuous criteria of efficiency facilitate the evaluation of the impact of the reforms and policies on the banks' performance. In this paper, we employ the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method for estimating the efficiency of Islamic banks in developed and developing countries. MARS is a well-known efficient method for the flexible modelling of high-dimensional data. Unlike previous work, using a nonparametric technique of such a robustness instead of parametric approaches contributes to the improvement of the various estimates, which provides investors with accurate and timely information they can immediately react upon for a better decision-making in turbulent times. On the one hand, the results of the experiments show that, in the emerging region, there is evidence of a strong linkage between Islamic banking efficiency and gross domestic product. On the other hand, in the developed region, the efficiency is rather based upon Sharia Supervisory Board and board committees. These outcomes confirm previous works showing that governance-related variables have a significant positive effect on Islamic banking efficiency. Furthermore, the overall MARS-based predictions reveal that Islamic banks operating in developed countries are relatively more efficient than their counterparts in emerging countries.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-022-04545-2,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The former include grants, loans, and workstudy and intend to help students finance or afford college attendance, persistence, and graduation. Post-purchase policies are designed to minimize financial burdens associated with having invested in college attendance and are granted as tax incentives/expenditures. One of these expenditures is the IRS’s Student Loan Interest Deduction (SLID)—which offers up to $2500 as an adjustment for taxable income based on having paid interest on student loans and has an annual cost of $12.81 billion—about 45.7% of the Pell grant cost. Despite this high cost, SLID has remained virtually unstudied. Accordingly, the study’s purpose is to assess how (in)effective SLID may be in reaching lower-income taxpayers. To address this purpose, we relied on an innovative analytic framework “multilevel modelling with spatial interaction effects” that allowed controlling for contextual and systemic observed and unobserved factors that may both affect college participation and may be related with SLID disbursements over and above income prospects. Data sources included the IRS, ACS, FBI, IPEDS, and the NPSAS:2015–2016. Findings revealed that SLID is regressive at the top, wealthier taxpayers and students attending more expensive colleges realize higher tax benefits than lower income taxpayers and students. Indeed, 75% of community college students were found to not be eligible to receive SLID—data and replication code ( https://cutt.ly/COyfdKC ) are provided. Is this the best use of this multibillion tax incentive? Is SLID designed to exclude the poorest, neediest students? A policy similar to Education Credits, focused on outstanding debt rather than on interest, that targets below-poverty line students with up to $5000 in debt, would represent a true commitment, and better use of public funds, to close socioeconomic gaps, by helping those more prone to default.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11162-021-09672-6,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To this end, we develop new forecast models adopting an imbalance sampling strategy based on machine learning techniques and apply these new models to predict credit risk of SMEs in China, using financial information, operation information, innovation information, and negative events as predictors. The empirical results show that the financial-based information, such as TOC, NIR, is most useful in predicting SMEs’ credit risk in SCF, and multi-source information fusion is meaningful in better predicting the credit risk. In addition, based on the preferred CSL-RF model, which extends cost-sensitive learning to a random forest, we also present the varying mechanisms of key predictors for SMEs’ credit risk by using partial dependency analysis.

There is a growing impact of machine learning in business applications, with many solutions already established and many more being explored. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being promptly adopted for various applications in the financial services industry. In essence, risk assessment happens if an investor and financial consultant analyses try to measure possible risks in investments such as morally sterilizing, following the fund's investment goals, and taking suitable action. Hence this paper's Machine learning-based risk awareness model (ML-RAM) has been proposed to reduce the financial crisis. This paper utilizes the RAM to focus on organized financial networks through potential financial threats. Early warning metrics boost the accuracy of the traditional crisis forecast model. The empirical analysis of small and medium companies asking for credit exposes that risky and not risky borrowers can be clustered consistent with a set of similar financial features, explaining their credit scores and predicting their future behavior. The data on which a considerable rise in correlations and centrality occur show a financial risk using network analyses and machine learning algorithms.

Classical machine learning models like linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, KNN, and decision rules are useful to machine learning engineers as well as business managers as these are easy to explain and provide good feedback to businesses. Individually, these models have not performed as per business expectations in real-time scenarios. Complex ML models like ANN can perform better and have higher accuracy as well, but the majority of these models are complex, and these ML approaches struggle to provide necessary feedback and act as black-box models. This trade-off of useful feedback for businesses and the accurate result makes such models not so desirable in such domains where both are required by businesses. Thus, the objectives of this study are (i) to suggest a suitable machine learning model to the banks in order to provide the explainable AI-based solution for predicting prospective customers of term deposits, (ii) to provide explainable AI-based solution which banks can use to gain insights and feedback and use them to improve the banking process further with a goal of not losing even a single potential customer.

To achieve the objective of providing a solution to the banks for predicting prospective customers of term deposits and further to gain insights and feedback to improve the banking process with a goal of not losing even a single potential customer, we have set the target recall score as 0.99, which may act as a benchmark for ML models used in this study. Further, all the ML models used in the study have the same count for the training dataset which enables us to evaluate model performance objectively. In the evaluation, we have used recall score, FPR value, and AUC score as metrics for model evaluation as accuracy as any other metric alone cannot help us with evaluation and reach the correct conclusion.

Wrong hiring decisions caused by the difficulty and complexity of evaluation can cause financial and non-financial losses for companies. For this reason, companies need more data-driven and machine learning (ML) based decision support systems to tackle these challenges. This study focuses on predicting candidates’ future performance based on the historical data of successful and unsuccessful employees using ML. We aim to support HR decision-makers to employ the right employee by minimizing the evaluation complexity of big data in the recruitment process. This study covers the data of 597 employees of a private bank serving in Turkey and considers the first two-year performance evaluations of the employees while creating output labels. We have conducted a three-stage methodology: We prepared the data set and organized it as training and testing in the first two stages. Finally, we selected a Logistic Regression model with a 71.19% accuracy by performing five-fold validation for Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), Decision Trees (DTs), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms. The result is improved by optimizing the parameters to a 73.14% accuracy level. The developed model is tested with another fresh data set and recorded a 71.67% accuracy rate.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-09176-6_3,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Precluding the financial institutions from being bankrupt requires an efficient method for the prediction of bankruptcy. Many researchers have used traditional statistical techniques to predict bankruptcy, while other researchers have been attempting to apply Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the same purpose. Most studies make a comparison between traditional statistical techniques and AI techniques. This survey presents several studies in bankruptcy prediction with the aim of comparing the results of the different methods. This comparison focuses on the performance metrices and the accuracy. Our survey will also show that a single methodology cannot be the general superior tool for every bankruptcy situation. Rather, each methodology will exhibit either strong or weak performance base on the situation and the used datasets.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2275-5_21,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A network structure of a DMU takes a holistic view of the production technology that connects several divisions internally by intermediate products and uses the carryovers flow over time to add a temporal dimension to it. In this paper, we propose a dynamic metafrontier Malmquist–Luenberger productivity index (DMMLPI) in the DNDEA framework to measure the total factor productivity change of a DMU when the data involves negative values and undesirable features. The DMMLPI decomposes the productivity change index into three indices: efficiency change, best-practice change, and technology gap change. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed index, we work on a balanced panel data of sixty Indian banks from 2013 to 2017. The sample banks are grouped into three categories: public banks, private banks, and foreign banks. The banks across the categories face heterogeneous production technology, business strategies, and operating environments. We assume that the underlying production architecture of each bank is a three-stage dynamic network. Our empirical analysis shows that foreign banks outperform their counterparts in terms of productivity change measured by the DMMLPI in the considered period.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-020-10071-9,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is essential to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability – which are especially paramount in the financial sector. The aim of this study was a preliminary investigation of the perspectives of supervisory authorities and regulated entities regarding the application of xAI in the financial sector. Three use cases (consumer credit, credit risk, and anti-money laundering) were examined using semi-structured interviews at three banks and two supervisory authorities in the Netherlands. We found that for the investigated use cases a disparity exists between supervisory authorities and banks regarding the desired scope of explainability of AI systems.

This trend is also driving companies, strategists, pioneers, entrepreneurs and researchers to use AI to design new strategies, create new sources of business value and manage innovative forms of financing. This scenario accurately describes the current situation of start-ups. New firms are forced to connect with AI in order to develop, either because of its importance for their products or services or because funders use it to make investment or purchase decisions. Therefore, to define the impact of AI on the financing of start-ups, we must differentiate between two contexts: the financing of technological start-ups based on AI and the use of AI by investors and funders to support the most cutting-edge and profitable start-ups. This chapter begins with an introduction to start-ups, the diversification of financial activities and the coherence of these new models with existing theoretical business frameworks that explain outcomes. Subsequently, it investigates the theory on AI in start-ups, providing real examples of emerging companies that illustrate these two contexts.

Until recently, conflicts between individuals’ societies and states had developed in a fundamental dimension regarding the ends, means, and modes of adversaries linked to geographical environments. With the emergence of cyberspace, these scenarios have changed to virtuality generating challenges to the proper safeguard of Security and Defense. Exposure of sensitive personal information has become one of the most feared weapons. This chapter focuses on a general review of the challenges posed by the emergence of cyberspace scenarios of armed conflict, emphasizing the ethical challenges that emanate from it. These new scenarios have been developing under the model of “anything goes,” and the existence of restrictions on the use of force and the damage caused to the adversary is practically nonexistent. The purpose of this research is to examine these challenges seeking to find opportunities for the construction of public policies in the area of security and defense to strengthen the legitimacy of the States and present the guidelines proposed by the Latin American Development Bank to make more efficient and ethical use of Data and Artificial Intelligence.

The Gammatone filter bank is modelled for the human auditory system which decomposes the environmental sound events into multiple frequency bands energy features. These features are learned during the training phase of DNN which is similar to the AED task by a human brain. Gammatone filter bank energy features are found superior over popular Mel-scale filter bank features and Gammatone filter bank output provides smooth spectrogram patterns that help to identify the dominant characteristic features of the target events. Moreover, the auditory feature-based Gammatone filter bank approach showed its robustness against the noise compared to Mel-scale filter bank features. In this work, the proposed GT-DNN model is tested on a single board computer (SBC) prototype developed on a popular Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Experimental F-score results show impressive real-time AED performance. Furthermore, different parameters of the model are optimised and it is used to classify the various acoustic events from Freiburg-106 event dataset. NOISEX-92 dataset is combined with the clean event dataset which is used to train the model. Comparison of AED performance in terms of F-score at different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) is carried out between GT-DNN and baseline Mel-scale filter bank energy features, and improved results are obtained with the GT-DNN method. Moreover, the confidence scores for 10 different classes of events are evaluated in presence of worst category babble noise at 0 dB SNR and excellent classification results are obtained using the proposed method.

Therefore, it is important for financial service providers (FSPs) to differentiate between low- and high-quality SMEs to accurately forecast the credit risk. This study proposes a novel hybrid ensemble machine learning approach to forecast the credit risk associated with SMEs’ agriculture 4.0 investments in SCF. Two core approaches were used, i.e., Rotation Forest algorithm and Logit Boosting algorithm. Key variables influencing the credit risk of agriculture 4.0 investments in SMEs were identified and evaluated using data collected from 216 agricultural SMEs, 195 Leading Enterprises and 104 FSPs operating in African agriculture sector. Besides the classical measures of credit risk assessment without involving SCF, the findings indicate that current ratio, financial leverage, profit margin on sales and growth rate of the agricultural SME are the upmost important variables that SCF actors need to focus on, in order to accurately and optimistically forecast and alleviate credit risk. The output of our study provides useful guidelines for SMEs, as it highlights the conditions under which they would be seen as creditworthy by FSPs. On the other hand, this study encourages the wide application of SCF in financing agriculture 4.0 investments. Due to the model’s performance, credit risk forecasting accuracy is improved, which results in future savings and credit risk mitigation in agriculture 4.0 investments of SMEs in SCF.

Secondly, it proposes to exploit the existence of such patterns for the benefit of planners through the computational power available today in machine learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) platforms.

The heat transfer fluid (HTF) is water-based MWCNT nanofluid (NF) in different NVFs ( ϕ  = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8%). Four different wave amplitudes ( α  = 2, 4, 6 and 8 mm), three different wavelengths ( λ  = 40, 60 and 80 mm) are studied in this paper. According to obtained results, the average Nusselt number (Nu) always increases by increase in wave amplitude or decrease in wavelength. Therefore, at α  = 8 mm or λ  = 40 mm the highest Nu value is achieved. Besides, Reynolds numbers (Re) variation has a significant influence on Nu distribution in tube and the Nu values always intensify by augmentation of Re. The optimum Reynolds number in thermal viewpoint is 11,000 and in second law viewpoint is 5000. Furthermore, therefore higher nanoparticles volume fraction (NVF) always leads to higher HTR in channel. But it also increases dynamic viscosity and pressure drop penalty in channel. The results of the models obtained from the neural network algorithm show that the variation of the Nusselt number with respect to the Reynolds number, wave amplitude and wavelength is mitotically so that heat transfer increases by increasing the amount of these three parameters. An increase in the wave amplitude leads to a 38% increase in the average Nusselt number and a 50% increase in the total Nusselt number. However, the effect of the wavelength is small. An increase in the wavelength results in an enhancement in the average Nusselt number by 6% and the total Nusselt number by 16%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10973-021-10717-2,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In developing an integrated predictive accuracy algorithm, this study proposes machine learning classifiers and applies DNN, SVM, KNN, and ANN. The proposed algorithm utilizes a 30,000 imbalanced dataset to improve the accuracy of the prediction of default payments by implementing oversampling and undersampling strategies, such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), SVM SMOTE, random undersampling, and ALL-KNN. The results indicate that the SVM under the ALL-KNN sampling technique is able to achieve an accuracy of 98.6%, with the lowest cross entropy loss measurement of 0.028. Through the accurate implementation of the neural networks and neurons used in the proposed algorithm, this paper presents better insights into the functioning of the neural networks when used in conjunction with the resampling techniques.

First, the risks of the Internet finance under the background of big data and the existing risk control modes are analyzed. Then, based on BP neural network (BPNN), an Internet financial fraud identification model is constructed, and corresponding touch rules are made. Its prediction performance is quantitatively compared with that of support vector machine and random forest algorithm. Finally, based on the structural equation model, the influence path of perceived security control on the Internet financial behavior is explored. The results show that, the applicants whose unit addresses are on blacklist have the highest touch fraud rate (14.16%). The precision rate (88.14%), accuracy rate (96.37%), recall rate (70.96%), and F-Score value (16.36) of the financial fraud identification model based on BPNN are the highest versus the other two algorithms, and the error detection rate (7.19%) is the lowest. The perceived security, identity authentication, non-repudiation of transactions, privacy protection, and control strength of data integrity positively affect users’ trust, which further positively affects the attitude and intention of using the Internet finance, and the intention eventually affects users’ behavior. Finally, some suggestions are put forward to improve the supervision of the Internet finance in China. To sum up, the Internet financial fraud identification model based on BPNN demonstrates satisfying performance and is worth of promotion.

First, the genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to adjust and determine the initial weights and thresholds of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), which assesses the credit risks. Second, for the problem that many factors affect the credit risks and the difficulty in selecting the characteristics, the principle of assessment indicator selection is proposed; the characteristics of these indicators are selected by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the case analysis method is utilized to verify the proposed risk assessment method, and an optimal credit risk assessment method is established. The results show that GA-BPNN can accelerate the convergence speed of the BPNN and improve the disadvantage in easily falling into the local minimum of BPNN. The PCA method simplifies the complexity of assessment indicator selection, and the representative indicators in agricultural SCF credit risk assessment are successfully selected. Through verification, it is found that the GA-BPNN algorithm performs well in credit risk prediction of agricultural SCF, and its prediction accuracy and prediction speed are improved.

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the “participatory” medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1007/s13167-021-00240-7,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The maximum return of the direct marketing campaigns is based on an appropriate prediction of the response rate and an elaborated description of the prospects. This paper plans to develop a new direct marketing campaign model in banking applications using a hybrid deep learning architecture. The proposed model consists of several steps like (a) Data acquisition, (b) Optimal feature selection, and (c) prediction. Initially, the direct marketing campaign data corresponding to banking applications are collected from other Google sites like Portuguese banking institutions. With the collected information, optimal feature selection is performed in order to reduce the dimension of the attribute or feature vector, thus can reduce the complexity of the prediction algorithm. Here, the optimal feature selection is performed by a new variant of a meta-heuristic algorithm termed as Self Adaptive-Sea Lion Optimization (SA-SLnO) Algorithm. Further, the optimally collected features are subjected to deep hybrid learning with the integration of Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). As an improvement to the deep learning model, the hidden neurons of both DBN and RNN are optimized by the same SA-SLnO. The outcome of the hybrid classifier is the decision of the customer on banking deposits. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is certified by comparing over the conventional methods through the evaluation of relevant performance measures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12065-021-00604-y,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal rewards. As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. In reinforcement learning, his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future states of the world. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal policy – a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. Exploring might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex behavioral problems.

ResTech is the application of technologies: i) to support the work of resolution authorities in developing resolution plans and in resolving financial firms; and ii) to allow financial firms to achieve regulatory compliance and better risk management in a more effective and automated manner. This paper also argues that the features and market dynamics of resolution differ from those of RegTech and SupTech: there is little market incentive for the private sector to foster innovation in the area of crisis resolution. The lack of private sector incentives to invest in R&D on how to resolve a firm’s crisis leaves the task to resolution authorities.

The index reveals which banks at a given quarter signal more uncertainty about their balance sheets. Higher uncertainty is associated with lower lending and higher liquidity the next quarter, suggesting active management of uncertainty. The active management of uncertainty is more pronounced during periods of high aggregate volatility and for banks with more skin in the game.

In line with the new age, they are moving away from their conventional methods to target customers for credit cards, loans, etc. products. The transactional data, customer information, which was collected over the years, have a huge scope of applying data mining techniques to extract useful information for maximizing the return on investment, cost optimization and fraud detection. For a successful deployment of a machine learning model multiple out of time validations are performed and stability is strictly evaluated. Here, we propose a cardinal method for intuitive use case related feature engineering, tuning the hyper parameters, best model selection and diagnosing the model for further improvements. The stability of a model plays a huge factor, as we expect the deployed model to work well for the next 6–8 months, then up for re-tuning based on the data distribution and model performance. Statistical and data driven methods are used to develop sophisticated features and achieved minimal accuracy variation across time periods. Implementation of our methods for the use cases like customer attrition from the bank in the next 6 months and detection of the in-bound calls from the customer to the call centre to enquire about balance, transaction details, etc. are discussed.

From manufacturing to service industries, AI have been a part of the company, in this modern era, where everything is handled by means of computers or human computer interface (HCI’s). AI is not a new innovation, but it has grown exponentially in recent years, catering a lot for sustainable growth. US and China are important countries that contribute to different applications using AI. As per Forrester report the customised customer platform offers quantitative benefits in the form of reduced costs, highly efficient human resources and enhanced customer engagement outcomes.

The present paper aims to address this gap in the literature by means of a field study based on 11 interviews with wealth managers from across front, middle and back offices in a large Swiss bank. Our analyses suggest bank employees have relatively positive attitudes toward the adoption of new technologies. According to the research, the top three advantages for adopting AI in wealth management are: efficiency, enhanced clients’ experience and better customer insight. Yet, AI also brings new challenges to banking. Obstacles identified include process complexity, greater maintenance effort, and increased regulatory requirements. Still, AI is expected to change the banking model to an integrated, hybrid and leaner operation with digital processes that offer front-to-back solutions. With respect to the future of the bank workforce, hiring tech-savvy talent will be crucial.

Advances in hardware, availability of large data sets, as well as innovation in architectural and algorithmic design, enabled successful application of Machine Learning models based on multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks to a variety of problems of practical interest. Unsupervised problems, as well as applications outside of mainstream computer science, such as computational social science, psychometrics, econometrics, people analytics, stock market prediction, social engineering, biology, and even art became the new frontiers for deep neural networks. We believe that advancements in neural information processing systems will likely revolutionize the field of finance in the coming years.

Financial datasets usually pose significant statistical challenges, and hence, traditional econometric methods fail in many practical applications. Though several approaches are suggested and being used, to predict whether a borrower would default on the loan availed, it is still an open challenge. In this work, two approaches are proposed based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) along with a hybrid neural network architecture to understand the context between financial transactions and loan defaults. The novelty of the proposed methods is in how they handle structured data and the associated temporal data. Further, the performance of the proposed approaches using debit card transactions and loan application information of customers to predict default is demonstrated. The experiments provided promising accuracies. Bidirectional LSTMs with a hybrid architecture achieve an accuracy of 94%. Hybrid neural network architectures used in this work provide an appropriate direction for making an early warning system through online loan default prediction. Kandappan, V. A. Rekha, A.

Because of the far-reaching nature of these transformations, the regulated banking and financial service system is increasingly unable to fulfil their traditional roles of connecting corporate borrowers and private investors. Alternative finance (FinTech) start-ups draw the largest benefits from the ongoing changes since they are relatively more flexible than the incumbents and can act more freely outside the strict regulations imposed on the incumbents. They use disruptive innovation—novel business models, products, or organisational advantages to ensure their lead in a niche, which has the potential to take over the whole industry. Psychometrics and artificial intelligence lie at the core of this disruptive force. These developments result in intimate connections between humans and machine, and customers and companies. This article covers some of the ongoing changes in society, technology, and in the financial industry.

The use of AI in the financial industry does not only raise questions of ethical responsibility and legal accountability, but also include more general issues. Other ethical challenges that must be addressed in a discourse in society are the individualization of service offerings, the ownership and security of data collections, the destruction of numerous jobs in the financial industry, and the systemic risks arising from consolidation using AI.

The most significant actions are on pricing. On the other side, investments by financial institutions are another vital source of income. Banking 5.0 supports risk pricing and investments. It can support pricing in the direction of the extreme customization of risk evaluation and detailed risk pricing. This chapter analyzes the risk management process. One of the significant benefits of digital banking adoption is the financial institutions’ ability to better forecast risks and customer demand.

This new trend is a process that can not be analyzed by unconventional methods, approaches, and techniques. This process is a dynamic mechanism that involves rapidly spreading effects. Therefore, digitalization has revealed an economic and social situation in which institutions are constantly transformed, innovations are applied very quickly, and are in demand. The most important problem in the studies to be carried out on this subject is the discussions about the measurement of digitalization and whether its numerical indicators are representative of the process or not. The extent of digitalization in the economy is Fintech applications in industry 4.0 money markets and financial markets in real terms. In today’s business world, the size of the relationship between production and the market changes in the digital economy. Achieving the accumulation of knowledge in the economy at lower costs with the effect of digitalization has led to the production of an important digital information. This accumulation of knowledge led to changes in economic behavior and preferences in business models. The economic area where the effect of this change is seen most rapidly is the financial area. Digitalization in the financial area is emerging as a new source of risk. In this respect, the increase in the volume of financial data with digitalization made the necessity of new analysis techniques necessary. Data sets resulting from the increase in the volume of data are defined as big data. In general, these big data have high frequency and real time or instant data feature in the financial system. The analysis of these data is a basic tool for measuring financial risks with systemic financial risks and the risk level of the markets. Digital economy is defined as a new economic structure as a result of changing the structure of the internet and communication systems. In this new structure, economic relations are created within the framework of the relationships established between the platforms. Establishing relationships between people, firms, and institutions through platforms reveal a lot of digitizable data. The continuous accumulation of this data online makes it necessary to carry out continuous analyzes according to each piece of information that is constantly received. The analysis of the information as well as the information turns into a product of economic value. The most important tool for this new transformation is artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence and deep learning methods with machine learning, which are its tools, also cause changes in the financial and monetary relations of the new economy. The first major impact of this change was on the banking system. The changes in the banking system and the digital currencies and the developments that emerged with Facebook’s announcement on the issue of the Libra currency cause changes in the primary functions of the central banks and in the monetary transfer mechanism. The main reason for the change in the primary function of the Central Bank and the change in the monetary transmission mechanism is the differentiation in the property of the money. The differentiation in the feature and function of the central bank has to redefine its functions along with the monetary definitions of the central banks. Within the framework of this trend, the aim of this study is to analyze the change in the structure of central banks, the characteristics of money, and the functions of monetary policies, with the artificial intelligence and digitalization process.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-33-6811-8_5,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We propose a novel meta-learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which we call MetaRL. It utilizes algorithms from different groups and optimizes their combination. Reinforcement learning (RL) technique is well suited to solve portfolio selection tasks because it can learn hidden dependencies in financial data and trading patterns by trial and error, directly predicts trading actions, and allows to consider delayed rewards. Moreover, RL naturally takes into account transaction costs and can model real trading when the strategy can impact the market. As agents, we use deep neural networks that decide which of the algorithms will be more profitable at a particular moment.

Generally, bank undergoes a rigorous procedure for verifying the customer to sanction loan. This procedure may take a week’s time or two. The drawback here is that the customer needs to wait for two whole weeks to know whether he/she is deserving or not. In this paper, we have reduced the risking factor of banks behind finding the appropriate person for loan approval by the bank. We even reduce the time of loan approval analysis. We first use data mining techniques to analyze previous records to which the bank has already sanctioned loan based on the analysis made out of these records we train the deep learning model. The new data is treated as testing data, and the output of the customer is calculated accordingly.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-66218-9_13,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In these domains, persons are increasingly assessed and judged by machines. The financial technology (Fintech) landscape ranges from automation of office procedures, to new approaches for storing and transferring value, to the granting of credit. The Fintech landscape can be separated into “incrementalist Fintech” and “futurist Fintech.” Incrementalist Fintech uses data, algorithms, and software to complement professionals who perform traditional tasks of existing financial institutions. It promises financial inclusion, but this inclusion can be predatory, creepy, and subordinating. These forms of financial inclusion undermine their solvency, dignity, and political power of borrowers. Futurist Fintech’s promoters claim to be more equitable, but are likely to falter in their aspiration to substitute technology for key financial institutions. When used to circumvent or co-opt state monetary authorities, both incrementalist and futurist Fintech expose deep problems at the core of the contemporary digitization of finance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-54173-6_10,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Design/Methodology/Approach— The study is exploratory and empirical in nature. Factors of adoption were determined on the basis of literature. The researchers have constructed a causal loop diagram with the help of VENSIM software to show the feedback loops of various factors. This paper also examines the determining factors that form the basis of adoption of artificial intelligence which directly contributes to increase in financial performance and market capitalisation of the organisation. A system dynamics model is constructed for this purpose using Stella software. Findings— The results suggest that apart from various risks and challenges involved in adoption of artificial intelligence, it is imperative for all financial institutes or companies involved in financial tasks to adopt artificial intelligence to achieve competency in global competition. The simulation of SD model clearly indicates that adoption of artificial intelligence in finance will help in further increase of financial performance and market capitalisation of organisation. Originality/Value— This paper contributes to the integration of emerging stage of technology, artificial intelligence and finance sector through systems dynamics model which provides holistic view to the problem.

Scoring is a mathematical or statistical model used by a bank to determine, based on the credit history of “past” clients, how likely it is that a particular potential borrower will repay the loan on time. A scoring model is a weighted sum of certain characteristics. The result is an integrated parameter (score); the higher it is, the more reliable the client is, and the bank can order the clients according to their level of creditworthiness in increasing order. The integrated parameter of each client is compared with a certain numerical threshold, or boundary line, which is essentially a break-even line and is obtained from the reckoning of the average number of clients paying on time needed to compensate for losses from a single debtor. Clients with an integrated parameter above this line are given credit, while clients with an integrated parameter below this line are not.

This two-way collaboration has many potential risks that need to be assessed. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender would make a profit from the interest. However, if the borrower fails to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders face predicting the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan at any step of the credit process. Many financial institutes calculate FICO scores of a customer based on some factors such as the Payment History (35%), Amounts owed (30%), Length of credit history (15%), Credit mix (10%), and New credit (10% of the total point) of the customer, that score qualifies how risk customers are, how repayment ability of the customer. FICO score (Fair Isaac Corporation) is a traditional approach used broadly in finance fields to estimate risks and give a worthy credit amount to the customer. In this study, a new way is to use Artificial intelligence to predict the above problems. It bases on credit information and more personal information of the customers to predict its repayment ability. The data collected from VietCredit Finances used for training several Machine Learning models to determine if the borrower can repay its loan. Some linear, nonlinear models involved are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine. The algorithm turning and Boosting and Bagging ensemble methods were also used to determine the best model. As a result, the Gradient Boosting model was the outperform and optimal predictive model (PR-AUC metric = 0.957).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-88207-5_26,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

FinTech is recognized as one of the most critical innovations in the financial industry and is evolving at a rapid speed, driven in part by the sharing economy, favorable regulation, and information technology. FinTech promises to disrupt and reshape the financial industry by cutting costs, improving the quality of financial services, and creating a more diverse and stable financial landscape. With the advances in e-finance and mobile technologies for financial firms, FinTech innovation emerged after the worldwide financial crisis in 2008 by combining e-finance, Internet technologies, social networking services, social media, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics. The valuation of FinTech companies concerns promising startups and some seasoned firms. FinTechs have a hybrid business model, as they operate in the financial (banking) sector deploying their technological attitudes. Evaluators may so wonder if FinTechs follow the typical evaluation patterns of bank/financial intermediaries or those of technological firms. Preliminary empirical evidence shows that the latter interpretation is the one consistent with the stock-market mood, and the business model of FinTechs.

However, the concept of reliability in its strict sense is conspicuously missing in financial services. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, in a first-of-its-kind study, we define the reliability of a bank/firm in terms of the financial ratios connoting the financial health of the bank to withstand the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy. For the purpose of estimating the reliability of a bank, we invoke a statistical and machine learning algorithm namely, logistic regression (LR). Once, the parameters are estimated in the 1st stage, we fix them and treat the financial ratios as decision variables. Thus, in the 1st stage, we accomplish the hitherto unknown way of estimating the reliability of a bank. Subsequently, in the 2nd stage, in order to maximize the reliability of the bank, we formulate an unconstrained optimization problem in a single-objective environment and solve it using the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Thus, in essence, these two stages correspond to predictive and prescriptive analytics respectively. The proposed 2-stage strategy of using them in tandem is beneficial to the decision makers within a bank who can try to achieve the optimal or near-optimal values of the financial ratios in order to maximize the reliability which is tantamount to safeguarding their bank against solvency or bankruptcy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2934-1_6,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Analysis of publications of specialized international organizations, statistical data, and news releases has revealed that the financial sector holds a special place in the modern economy and therefore has to play a key role in confronting environmental challenges by mobilizing financial resources for sustainable activities, providing insurance coverage and helping to manage and hedge ESG-associated risks. However, despite the growing willingness of individuals to invest sustainably, institutional investors now face numerous difficulties when trying to respond to this shift in demand by adapting their investment strategies and offering specialized financial instruments. These difficulties include, among others, the lack of standardized definitions of sustainable activities and instruments; the voluntary and inconsistent nature of corporate ESG disclosure; the complex and long-term character of ESG-related risks. Digital technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence , can contribute to elimination of these difficulties by identifying, collecting, standardizing, and analyzing the vast amounts of inconsistent ESG-related data in order to evaluate sustainability risks and to provide insights on a company’s ESG performance even in the absence of standardized disclosure and at significantly reduced cost in comparison with manual research. However, digital technologies can themselves pose ESG-related risks, producing negative effects on environment, employment, inequality, and raising privacy concerns. It is therefore recommended that national authorities should not only promote the wider use of digital technologies in sustainable finance, but also set up legal frameworks to guard against the associated risks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-75405-1_33,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we build a system to construct a model by training the system with records and approval results of the previously applied loan applicants. Model building is done by classification algorithms on the basis on some predictive features that categorize an outcome value as approve or disapprove. We found logistic regression model has the best performance in comparison with other models and can be used as a predictive model reducing the risk factor in selecting the deserving applicants for loan repayment saving a lot of bank efforts and assets.

To optimize its performance and to accelerate its process, we propose speeded KNN algorithm based on preprocessing and significant attributes filtering and normalization. It also includes another improvement based on variation of neighbors (k) and similarity model which insures a more accurate classification. Thus, the contributions of this paper are three-fold: (i) introduce high preprocessing method separately each type of features and imputation of missing values of attributes; the automation of features normalization (ii) the selection of realistic and most significant attributes which are known before the call, and (iii) the combination of optimal k and similarity models which gives the best performances.

The goal of AI is to allow computers to imitate human intelligence, perception, thinking, and action, so as to achieve automation and gain analytical insights. To imitate human intelligence, AI applications adopt two methods: rule-based and non-rule-based algorithms. Rule-based AI uses pre-set rules to “learn”, while non-rule-based AI uses machine learning algorithms to “learn” and a trained AI model to “think”. The key driving force for the development of AI is the huge increase of available data and the great improvement of computing power in traditional computers and mobile devices, as well as the continuous development of machine learning algorithms. Commercial banks conduct large numbers of customer capital transactions, and hold large amounts of account management information.

A bank that manages its liquidity inadequately can severely harm its liquidity position and potentially threaten the stability of the entire financial system. Central banks try to anticipate these risks by carefully monitoring the liquidity management of banks in large-value payment systems (LVPSs). Typically, they do this based on statistical methods in which various risk indicators related to the liquidity usage of banks are calculated from the transaction log of an LVPS. These indicators need to be manually analyzed by payment experts to find irregularities that could signal potential risks. Although statistical methods provide much insight into the liquidity management of banks, they do not scale well to the large number of banks that are subject to risk monitoring and the high velocity by which payments are nowadays settled. In this paper, we investigate whether the liquidity management of banks can be monitored more efficiently by anomaly detection. We construct different probabilistic classifiers that classify delta sequences of banks by the corresponding bank. A delta sequence captures the change in the liquidity position of a bank in an LVPS throughout a given day. Accordingly, anomalies in the intraday liquidity usage of banks are detected by determining whether the classifiers misclassify recent delta sequences that were not used to train the classifiers. Our results show that recurrent neural networks are well suited to perform this classification task and detect many irregularities in payment behavior that are interesting for the supervisors and operators of an LVPS.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10614-020-10067-5,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The author argues that the development of AI should continue to adhere to the regulatory objectives of market safety, consumer protection, and market integrity. However, to ensure equality and fairness, access to finance should be made a clear policy choice. In the first part, the author discusses how AI can lead to systemic risks and market manipulation on trading platforms. For example, by examining the use of algorithms for trading on the capital market, the author discerns the regulatory objectives and the possible methods of regulation for peer-to-peer platforms. In the second part, the author discusses how the use of AI to provide consumers with investment advice, such as financial advice provided from robo-advisers, can close the investment advisory gap and provide consumers with access to finance. The current regime does not provide adequate protection to financial consumers in this regard. In the third part, the author discusses how AI can be used as a form of RegTech to streamline compliance processes, thereby increasing competition in financial markets and providing a benefit to consumers. However, this use may be in conflict with privacy, data protection, and ethical concerns.

If So, for Whom?",Research in Higher Education,10.1007/s11162-019-09565-9,Springer,2020-11-01,"The study of student loan debt remains a timely and relevant higher education finance research and policy-oriented topic, especially when considering the alarming growth rates of student loan debt balances. The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit released in May of 2018 shows that among all debt balances, student loans remain the only form of debt that virtually sextupled over the last 15-years, and this trend is not slowing down. Although aggregated trends are important, by definition they are limited in their capabilities to providing researchers, policy- and decision-makers with insights related to individual debt accumulation and, perhaps more importantly, with knowledge about the factors associated with variation of individual debt burden. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this study is to ameliorate this limitation in three meaningful ways. First, this is the first study that offers inferential estimates of the magnitude of student debt accumulation increase across two different decades (1991–2013) and institutional sectors (public 2- and 4-year colleges). Second, these estimates are based on student level undergraduate non-self-reported longitudinal loan debt disbursements. Third, the estimates not only account for individuals’ baseline differences at the moment of college entry, but also account for institution- and state-level indicators that took place during college enrollment and that may be related to the variation of student loan debt reliance. Two nationally representative samples (NELS and ELS) complemented with other institution- and state-level data were analyzed using doubly robust estimators build from propensity score weights and entropy balancing approaches that were robust to unobservable selection issues using Oster’s approach (J Bus Econ Stat 37(2):1–18, 2017). The results consistently indicated that, among all participants, student borrowing participation increased by 15 percentage points in the 2000s, compared to the 1990s, and individual debt accumulation at least doubled across decades. Notably, among 4-year degree holders, the 2-year path toward a 4-year degree consistently resulted in about 10% lower debt accumulation compared to the 4-year path toward a 4-year degree. Students who did not attain a 4-year degree were better served by having started college in the 2-year sector. In terms of overall debt increase, 4-year degree holders accrued about $8000 more on average than their counterparts did during the 1990s, however, the recent cohort also repaid about $11,000 more, on average (or three times as much), than participants did in the 1990s. These higher repayment behaviors observed among 4-year degree holders, resulted in similar amounts of their respective debt balances across decades. The implications are clear: students with higher propensities toward a 4-year degree attainment are likely to incur lower debt if they start college in the community college sector. However, before fully recommending this pathway, 2- and 4-year colleges’ articulation agreements should be strengthened to ease transfer and eventual degree completion. Without recommending consolidation or merger between 2- and 4-year institutions, researchers and policy makers can learn from the strategies implemented by successful cases such as Perimeter College and Georgia State. Finally, 4-year entrants with lower likelihood to attain a 4-year degree may be better served by beginning college in the 2-year sector instead. Predictive analytics and machine learning techniques can be used to identify these cases, as depicted in the discussion section of the study.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11162-019-09565-9,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This rise in the use of such applications in smart devices has increased security concerns. There is need for secure mechanisms to prevent fraud and protect personal information. This paper investigates the use of biometric identification in banking and financial services, which leverage the use of smartphones and tablets. While customer engagement and brand loyalty are important concerns, these services are making use of biometric authentication to make customer interactions more secure. However, as technology is growing rapidly, spoofing attacks are becoming common. In this paper, authors have proposed a robust framework to detect spoofing attacks in fingerprint recognition. The process of spoofing detection involves contrast enhancement using histogram equalization and a deep convolutional neural network architecture. Authors have validated the results on various biometric spoofing benchmarks, each one containing real and spoofed samples of user fingerprints. The results indicate that our proposed framework performs better as evaluated against other existing pre-trained CNN models and state-of-the-art methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-019-04190-1,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, most existing recommender systems employ the collaborative or community-based approach which relies on the preferences or behaviour of other users, in conjunction with that of the target user. This approach may not be applicable to domains such as banking. The two major challenges to using the collaborative approach in the banking domain are: (1) absence of explicit ratings of products by customers for recommendation purpose, (2) cold-start problem which makes it difficult to recommend products to a prospective or new customer who has no preference at all. To tackle the first issue, we develop an algorithm that implicitly infers customer preferences from transaction data. To address the second issue, we propose a hybrid recommender system that combines the item-based collaborative filtering technique (which uses the customer preference data from the algorithm) and the demographic-based approach (which uses customers’ demographics). We contribute to knowledge by developing a practical and feasible approach for implementing recommender systems that drive product marketing in the banking sector. We also discuss the performance of this approach based on 393,816 customers dataset. The hybrid approach is applicable to other domains with similar challenges.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s42786-019-00014-w,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The stated goal of the XS2A rule is to help an infant industry grow: that of Fintech payment services. However, mounting evidence suggests that unlike Fintech startups, big techs may benefit from the norm, putting a much stronger challenge to established banks. The latter indeed have less access to data about consumers’ behavior (preferences, habits and conducts), less analytics capacity, and thus are placed in a competitive disadvantage by the XS2A, compared to their big tech rivals. According to many, that may result in competition harm and consumer welfare reduction in the medium and long run. The article revisits the rationales for introducing the XS2A rule by critically assessing its asserted goals (Part 1). It then suggests (Part 2) that to level the playing field among the market players involved and increase its overall proportionality, the norm be revisited. In the relationship between big tech and the banks, we propose to complement the XS2A rule with a “reciprocity clause”. Instead of free access to customers’ account data, big tech would pay by counter-providing access to the behavioral data in their possession pertaining to the same customers concerned by the XS2A, and upon their consent. Data thus transmitted would only be available upon condition of reuse to increase the efficiency of the payment service provision. Reciprocity would greatly enhance data circulation among market participants, while fostering competition among them, creating incentives for more innovation and strengthening the overall proportionality of the XS2A rule.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40319-020-00914-1,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Different approaches are tested and compared using real data. Out of sample results are very good, even with very challenging out-of-sample sets composed only of churners, that truly test the ability to predict when a customer will churn. The best results are obtained by stochastic boosting, and the most important variables for predicting churn in a 1–2 months horizon are the total value of bank products held in recent months and the existence of debit or credit cards in another bank.

This work focuses on introducing a so-named Bag of Expert (BoE): a novel approach for creating multi-expert Learning (MEL) frameworks aimed to emulate real experts labeling (human-given labels) using neural networks. The MEL systems “learn” to perform decision-making tasks by considering a uniform number of labels per sample or individuals along with respective descriptive variables. The BoE is created similarly to Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), but rather than using noise or perturbation by a generator, we trained a feed-forward neural network to randomize sampling data, and either add or decrease hidden neurons. Additionally, this paper aims to investigate the performance on economics-related datasets of several state-of-the-art MEL methods, such as GPC, GPC-PLAT, KAAR, MA-LFC, MA-DGRL, and MA-MAE. To do so, we develop an experimental framework composed of four tests: the first one using novice experts; the second with proficient experts; the third is a mix of novices, intermediate and proficient experts, and the last one uses crowd-sourcing.

There has been suggested and proven a hypothesis that a neural network applied provides quantization of data and makes it possible to identify patterns that further form a neural network—a perceptron that allows predicting bank profits based on its input data in a market uncertainty. The dynamics and structure of the investment portfolios of Russian banks for 2015–2017 have been studied. The trends in the formation of the investment portfolios in the Russian banking system as a whole have been analyzed and identified; visualization of the multidimensional space of factorial features (assets, stocks and profits) has been obtained due to quantization of big data. The influence of a number of factors has been revealed, for example, the influence of an investment portfolio structure on the bank’s profit. The perceptron was applied to calculate a predicted value of the “bank profit”. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that an artificial intelligence system has been formed, which allows predicting bank profits based on input parameters, including stocks, bonds and bills in its investment portfolio in the conditions of market uncertainty.

As one of the new intelligent needs in the AI 2.0 era, financial intelligence has elicited much attention from the academia and industry. In our current dynamic capital market, financial intelligence demonstrates a fast and accurate machine learning capability to handle complex data and has gradually acquired the potential to become a “financial brain.” In this paper, we survey existing studies on financial intelligence. First, we describe the concept of financial intelligence and elaborate on its position in the financial technology field. Second, we introduce the development of financial intelligence and review state-of-the-art techniques in wealth management, risk management, financial security, financial consulting, and blockchain. Finally, we propose a research framework called FinBrain and summarize four open issues, namely, explainable financial agents and causality, perception and prediction under uncertainty, risk-sensitive and robust decision-making, and multi-agent game and mechanism design. We believe that these research directions can lay the foundation for the development of AI 2.0 in the finance field.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1631/FITEE.1700822,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this detection task, music segments should be annotated from the broadcast data, where music, speech, and noise are mixed. The convolutional neural network is composed of a convolutional layer with kernel that is trained to extract robust features. The Mel-scale changes the kernel size, and the backpropagation algorithm trains the kernel shape. We used 52 h of mixed broadcast data (25 h of music) to train the convolutional network and 24 h of collected broadcast data (ratio of music of 50–76%) for testing. The test data consisted of various genres (drama, documentary, news, kids, reality, and so on) that are broadcast in British English, Spanish, and Korean languages. The proposed method consistently showed better performance in all the three languages than the baseline system, and the F -score ranged from 86.5% for British data to 95.9% for Korean drama data.

Traditionally, the filters are linearly distributed on perceptual frequency scale such as Mel scale. To make the output smoother, these filters are often placed so that they overlap with each other. However, fixed-parameter filters are usually in the context of psychoacoustic experiments and selected experimentally. To make filter banks discriminative, the authors use a neural network structure to learn the frequency center, bandwidth, gain, and shape of the filters adaptively when filter banks are used as a feature extractor. This paper investigates several different constraints on discriminative frequency filter banks and the dual spectrum reconstruction problem. Experiments on audio source separation and audio scene classification tasks show performance improvements of the proposed filter banks when compared with traditional fixed-parameter triangular or gaussian filters on Mel scale.

At present, modern encryption techniques are said to be sufficient to secure information but still there is a need to enhance these encryption techniques as these are uncertain in providing unconditional security causing some communication security issues. In this paper we have proposed quantum solution to address such security issues by engaging AI. By replacing SSL or SET connections having classical encryption techniques with the quantum cryptographic security systems, privacy and authenticity of data can be ensured and will minimize the chances of attacks.

The first resulted in the development of a scoring approach to lending in a West African bank that had previously been deemed impossible due to the lack of relevant data. By using cognitive ergonomics, practitioners demonstrated to risk managers that scores could be developed using local customer characteristics. The second initiative was the application of new technology using deep neural networks for image processing. Through a cognitive task analysis of hundreds of risk managers, we determined that they spend most of their time verifying information. By combining advanced image processing and scoring we were able to fully automate the loan adjudication process. We believe that this insight could transform the lending industry.

In the second approach, raw sound signal in time domain is fed to the network. Despite the radically different form and content of the input data, the neural architecture is similar, with 2D convolutional layers in the first approach and 1D convolutional layers in the second one, and also identical fully-connected output layers in both approaches. We put emphasis to use practically the same number of trainable parameters in both networks, as well as the same size of input signal snippets used for training.

These two approaches are based on Feed Forward Neural Networks. We have used a private bank dataset with more than 11 million transactions and converted it to data series. Then we employed two representation methods to convert each time series to a fix size [1 × 100] vector. The first approach ignores the order in data series and gains more than 96% compression ratio (30:1). The second method preserves order of data to some extent and gets about 24% compression ratio (1.35:1).

Therefore to improve the classification performance it is essential to minimize the ‘classification’ errors. Here, in this work, we propose a hybrid CNN-GWO approach for the recognition of human actions from the unconstrained videos. The weight initializations for the proposed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers highly depend on the generated solutions of GWO (Grey Wolf Optimization) algorithm, which in turn minimizes the ‘classification’ errors. The action bank and local spatio-temporal features are generated for a video and fed into the ‘CNN’ classifiers. The ‘CNN’ classifiers are trained by a gradient descent algorithm to detect a ‘local minimum’ during the fitness computation of GWO ‘search agents’. The GWO algorithms ‘global search’ capability as well as the gradient descent algorithms ‘local search’ capabilities are subjected for the identification of a solution which is nearer to the global optimum. Finally, the classification performance can be further enhanced by fusing the classifiers evidences produced by the GWO algorithm. The proposed classification frameworks efficiency for the recognition of human actions is evaluated with the help of four achievable action recognition datasets namely HMDB51, UCF50, Olympic Sports and Virat Release 2.0.

The level of exchange rate volatility may be higher in developing countries than in developed countries. This situation can be seen both in the real sector and in the financial sector. In the real sector, especially companies that meet their raw material and intermediary needs through import are affected by the exchange rate volatility, while the financial sector is more affected by exchange rate volatility in the markets with weak-efficiency levels. These determinant attributes reflect the characteristics of developing countries. Therefore, the identification of parameters that can provide knowledge about changes in exchange rates is important for both the real sector and the financial sector. Also, this knowledge is also important regarding increasing the effectiveness of exchange rate interventions, one of the instruments of monetary policy in modern central banking practices. This chapter aims to attain explanation capacity of domestic macroeconomic factors of convertible exchange rates and rules for the application made by OneR algorithm which is one of the data mining methods and the machine learning techniques. The reason for using only domestic macroeconomic variables and the exclusion of international macroeconomic variables in the study is that it is more frequent to attain knowledge about domestic macroeconomic variables which are estimated within the countries. Thus, it is aimed to increase the frequency of observing convertible exchange rates with the rules acquired by the OneR algorithm. It is also aimed to investigate whether the exchange rate movements included in this study can be modeled by using only domestic macroeconomic variables as a glocal approach. EUR/USD, GBP/USD, JPY/USD, and TRY/USD exchange rates are analyzed within the scope of the chapter. The findings of the chapter show that (1) the problem of estimation of the exchange rate movements is insufficient to solve by OneR algorithm; (2) it is seen that the success rate of the models with a relatively small number of input variables is higher in this application; therefore, the importance of the use of lean models is supported by the results of the chapter; and (3) in terms of the primary aim of the survey, Turkey’s domestic macroeconomic variables are not sufficient to explain convertible exchange rates. As the reasons for these findings, it can say that the Turkish economy is a developing economy and that the economy is small compared to developed country economies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-78494-6_22,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this work, we test the hypothesis that if the input includes the responses of established image analysis filters that detect salient image structures, the CNN should be able to perform better than an identical CNN fed with the plain RGB images only. Thus, we employ a number of families of image analysis filter banks and use their responses to compile a small number of filtered responses for each original RGB image. We perform a large number of CNN training/testing repetitions for a 40-class building recognition problem, on a publicly available image database, using the original images, as well as the original images augmented by the compiled filter responses.

In this manner, a specific convolutional kernel can be dynamically obtained for each conditional input. The filter bank is shared between all conditions thus only a low-dimension weight vector needs to be learned. This significantly facilitates the parameter learning across different conditions when training data are limited. We evaluate DCCN on four tasks which can be formulated as conditional model learning, including specific object counting, multi-modal image classification, phrase grounding and identity based face generation.

In these cases it is important to define priorities avoiding to waste time and resources for not savable victims. Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) methodology is the well-known and standard system usually used by practitioners to predict the survival probability of trauma patients. However, practitioners have noted that the accuracy of TRISS predictions is unacceptable especially for severely injured patients. Thus, alternative methods should be proposed. Methods In this work we evaluate different approaches for predicting whether a patient will survive or not according to simple and easily measurable observations. We conducted a rigorous, comparative study based on the most important prediction techniques using real clinical data of the US National Trauma Data Bank. Results Empirical results show that well-known Machine Learning classifiers can outperform the TRISS methodology. Based on our findings, we can say that the best approach we evaluated is Random Forest: it has the best accuracy, the best area under the curve, and k-statistic, as well as the second-best sensitivity and specificity. It has also a good calibration curve. Furthermore, its performance monotonically increases as the dataset size grows, meaning that it can be very effective to exploit incoming knowledge. Considering the whole dataset, it is always better than TRISS. Finally, we implemented a new tool to compute the survival of victims. This will help medical practitioners to obtain a better accuracy than the TRISS tools. Conclusion Random Forests may be a good candidate solution for improving the predictions on survival upon the standard TRISS methodology.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00068-016-0757-3,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) is a directly-transmitted RNA virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans, and is carried and transmitted by the bank vole ( Myodes glareolus ). In northern Sweden, bank voles undergo 3–4 year population cycles, during which their spatial distribution varies greatly. Methods We used boosted regression trees; a technique inspired by machine learning, on a 10 – year time-series (fall 2003–2013) to develop a spatial predictive model assessing seasonal PUUV hazard using micro-habitat variables in a landscape heavily modified by forestry. We validated the models in an independent study area approx. 200 km away by predicting seasonal presence of infected bank voles in a five-year-period (2007–2010 and 2015). Results The distribution of PUUV-infected voles varied seasonally and inter-annually. In spring, micro-habitat variables related to cover and food availability in forests predicted both bank vole and infected bank vole presence. In fall, the presence of PUUV-infected voles was generally restricted to spruce forests where cover was abundant, despite the broad landscape distribution of bank voles in general. We hypothesize that the discrepancy in distribution between infected and uninfected hosts in fall, was related to higher survival of PUUV and/or PUUV-infected voles in the environment, especially where cover is plentiful. Conclusions Moist and mesic old spruce forests, with abundant cover such as large holes and bilberry shrubs, also providing food, were most likely to harbor infected bank voles. The models developed using long-term and spatially extensive data can be extrapolated to other areas in northern Fennoscandia. To predict the hazard of directly transmitted zoonoses in areas with unknown risk status, models based on micro-habitat variables and developed through machine learning techniques in well-studied systems, could be used.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12879-017-2618-z,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The segmentation stage determines the accuracy of the measurement process of nanotube when assessing the quality of nanomaterials. In this work, we propose two segmentation algorithms for carbon nanotube images. Each algorithm includes three stages: preprocessing, segmentation and postprocessing. The first one is applied on images from scanning electron microscopy and employs a matched filter bank in the preprocessing step followed by a neural network in the segmenting phase. The second algorithm uses the Perona–Malik filter for enhancing the nanotube information. The segmentation phase is composed of the relaxed Otsu’s threshold and an artificial neural network. This algorithm is applied on images from transmission electron microscopy. The postprocessing stage, for both algorithms, is based on mathematical morphology. The performance of the proposed algorithms is numerically evaluated by using real image databases, manually segmented by an expert. The algorithm for segmentation of scanning electron microscopy achieved 92.74% of overall accuracy, while the algorithm for segmentation of transmission electron microscopy obtained an accuracy of 73.99% if the whole image is considered.

We do so by means of a multi-objective genetic algorithm. We deployed our solution in a real-world setting of a large national banking group and conducted an in-depth experimental evaluation.

In this new space, the distances between the vector positions are smaller for the elements with similar financial meaning. Likewise, the distances between the unrelated elements are larger, which is very useful in automatically capturing the relationships between the financial transaction elements without any manual intervention.

The second algorithm includes the Perona-Malik filter for enhancing the nanotube information. The segmentation phase is composed by the relaxed Otsu’s threshold and an artificial neural network. This algorithm is applied on images from Transmission Electron Microscopy. After the segmentation, for both algorithms, a preprocessing based on mathematical morphology is carried out. The performance of the proposed algorithms is numerically evaluated by using real image databases. Overall accuracy of 92.74 % and 73.99 % were obtained for the first and second algorithm respectively.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-27060-9_28,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We present the concept of LTV applied to telemarketing for improving the return-on-investment, using a recent (from 2008 to 2013) and real case study of bank campaigns to sell long-term deposits. The goal was to benefit from past contacts history to extract additional knowledge. A total of twelve LTV input variables were tested, under a forward selection method and using a realistic rolling windows scheme, highlighting the validity of five new LTV features. The results achieved by our LTV data-driven approach using neural networks allowed an improvement up to 4 pp in the Lift cumulative curve for targeting the deposit subscribers when compared with a baseline model (with no history data). Explanatory knowledge was also extracted from the proposed model, revealing two highly relevant LTV features, the last result of the previous campaign to sell the same product and the frequency of past client successes. The obtained results are particularly valuable for contact center companies, which can improve predictive performance without even having to ask for more information to the companies they serve.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-014-1703-0,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In our current approach we use the multi-layer perceptron networks to extract the articulatory features on the basis of non-linear mapping from standard acoustic features extracted from speech signal. The suitability of various acoustic features and the optimum length of temporal context at the input of used network were analysed. The temporal context is represented by a context window created from the stacked feature vectors. The optimum length of the temporal contextual information was analysed and identified for the context window in the range from 9 to 21 frames.

Correct prediction of secondary structures can significantly reduce the degrees of freedom in protein tertiary structure modeling and therefore reduces the difficulty of obtaining high resolution 3D models. Methods In this work, we investigate a template-based approach to enhance 8-state secondary structure prediction accuracy. We construct structural templates from known protein structures with certain sequence similarity. The structural templates are then incorporated as features with sequence and evolutionary information to train two-stage neural networks. In case of structural templates absence, heuristic structural information is incorporated instead. Results After applying the template-based 8-state secondary structure prediction method, the 7-fold cross-validated Q8 accuracy is 78.85%. Even templates from structures with only 20%~30% sequence similarity can help improve the 8-state prediction accuracy. More importantly, when good templates are available, the prediction accuracy of less frequent secondary structures, such as 3-10 helices, turns, and bends, are highly improved, which are useful for practical applications. Conclusions Our computational results show that the templates containing structural information are effective features to enhance 8-state secondary structure predictions.

Quantum Chemical Topology (QCT) is used to partition the electron density of a chemical system into atoms, then the machine learning method Kriging is used to build models that relate the multipole moments of the atoms to the positions of their surrounding nuclei. The pilot system serine is used to study both the influence of the level of theory and the set of data generator methods used. The latter consists of: (i) sampling of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), or (ii) normal mode distortion along either (a) Cartesian coordinates, or (b) redundant internal coordinates. Wavefunctions for the sampled geometries were obtained at the HF/6-31G(d,p), B3LYP/apc-1, and MP2/cc-pVDZ levels of theory, prior to calculation of the atomic multipole moments by volume integration. The average absolute error (over an independent test set of conformations) in the total atom-atom electrostatic interaction energy of serine, using Kriging models built with the three data generator methods is 11.3 kJ mol^-1 (PDB), 8.2 kJ mol^-1 (Cartesian distortion), and 10.1 kJ mol^-1 (redundant internal distortion) at the HF/6-31G(d,p) level.

Accurately predicting disulfide bonds from protein sequences is important for modeling the structural and functional characteristics of many proteins. Methods In this work, we introduce an approach of enhancing disulfide bonding prediction accuracy by taking advantage of context-based features. We firstly derive the first-order and second-order mean-force potentials according to the amino acid environment around the cysteine residues from large number of cysteine samples. The mean-force potentials are integrated as context-based scores to estimate the favorability of a cysteine residue in disulfide bonding state as well as a cysteine pair in disulfide bond connectivity. These context-based scores are then incorporated as features together with other sequence and evolutionary information to train neural networks for disulfide bonding state prediction and connectivity prediction. Results The 10-fold cross validated accuracy is 90.8% at residue-level and 85.6% at protein-level in classifying an individual cysteine residue as bonded or free, which is around 2% accuracy improvement. The average accuracy for disulfide bonding connectivity prediction is also improved, which yields overall sensitivity of 73.42% and specificity of 91.61%.

Its detection is a typical use case of the broad-based Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) methodology. However, there is very limited information available to distinguish dynamic fraud from genuine customer behavior in such an extremely sparse and imbalanced data environment, which makes the instant and effective detection become more and more important and challenging. In this paper, we propose an effective online banking fraud detection framework that synthesizes relevant resources and incorporates several advanced data mining techniques. By building a contrast vector for each transaction based on its customer’s historical behavior sequence, we profile the differentiating rate of each current transaction against the customer’s behavior preference. A novel algorithm, ContrastMiner, is introduced to efficiently mine contrast patterns and distinguish fraudulent from genuine behavior, followed by an effective pattern selection and risk scoring that combines predictions from different models. Results from experiments on large-scale real online banking data demonstrate that our system can achieve substantially higher accuracy and lower alert volume than the latest benchmarking fraud detection system incorporating domain knowledge and traditional fraud detection methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11280-012-0178-0,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Some of the foundations of this area were established by Alan M. Turing in his two seminal papers about machine intelligence [39] and [40]. Machine Learning (ML) is an important branch within the AI field which currently is on an intensive stage of development due to its wide range of applications. In particular, ML techniques have recently gained recognition in finance, since they are capable to produce useful models. However, the difficulty, and even the impossibility, to interpret these models, has limited the use of ML techniques in some problems where the interpretability is an important issue. Bankruptcy prediction for banks is a task which demands understandability of the solution. Furthermore, the analysis of the features (input variables), to create prediction models, provides better knowledge about the conditions which may trigger bank defaults. The selection of meaningful features before executing the learning process is beneficial since it reduces the dimensionality of the data by decreasing the size of the hypothesis space. As a result, a compact representation is obtained which is easier to interpret. The main contributions of this work are: first, the use of the evolutionary technique called Multi-Population Evolving Decision Rules MP-EDR to determine the relevance of some features from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) data to predict bank bankruptcy. The second contribution is the representation of the features’ relevance by means of a network which has been built by using the rules and conditions produced by MP-EDR. Such representation is useful to disentangle the relationships between features in the model, this representation is aided by metrics which are used to measure the relevance of such features.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-29694-9_24,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fortunately, financial institutions count with external vendors databases that indicate the level of recognition of their customers. However, this information is normally presented as features with partial scores that must be aggregated into an overall matching accuracy score. This score indicates how similar a record is to a master database that contains the best available public information about a specific customer. In addition, information management and risk management departments of financial institutions may have very different models. Hence, it is necessary to connect the customer recognition information with risk models. This paper studies this problem in two parts: (1) generation of a matching accuracy score to quantify the status of entity resolution between consumer records of a major financial company and an external database, and (2) evaluation of the relationship between the matching accuracy score and several risk segments. As a final result, an overall matching accuracy score is obtained for every customer using the most current account information and a learning algorithm. The matching accuracy score is an indicator of the level of customer recognition. This matching accuracy score is correlated with the FICO score (FICO is a risk score generated by the company Fair Isaac & Co. The maximum value of FICO is 850.

Financial crises are recurrent phenomena in modern financial systems. The literature offers several definitions of financial instability, but it is well known that a financial crisis with a banking crisis is the most common example of financial instability. In this paper we introduce a novel model for detection and prediction of crises, based on the hybridization of a standard logistic regression with Product Unit (PU) neural networks and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. These hybrid approaches are described in the paper, and applied to the detection and prediction of banking crises by using a large database of countries in the period 1981 to 1999.

Thus, Basel II Accord on Banking Supervision legislates the framework for credit risk assessment. Linear scoring models have been developed for this assessment, which are functions of systematic and idiosyncratic factors. Among statistical techniques that have been applied for factor and weight selection, Neural Networks (NN) have shown superior performance as they are able to learn non linear relationships among factors and they are more efficient in the presence of noisy or incorrect data. In particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are useful when we have at hand historical series as they are able to grasp the data’s temporal dynamics. In this work, we describe an application of RNN to credit risk assessment. RNN (specifically, Elman networks) are compared with two former Neural Network systems, one with a standard feed-forward network, while the other with a special purpose architecture. The application is tested on real-world data, related to Italian small firms.

This algorithm selects the largest strongly connected component of a social network and ranks its vertices using several indicators of distance and centrality. These indicators are merged with other relevant indicators in order to forecast new variables using a boosting algorithm. We applied the algorithm CorpInterlock to integrate the metrics of an extended corporate interlock (social network of directors and financial analysts) with corporate fundamental variables and analysts’ predictions (consensus). CorpInterlock used these metrics to forecast the trend of the cumulative abnormal return and earnings surprise of S&P 500 companies. The rationality behind this approach is that the corporate interlock has a direct effect on future earnings and returns because these variables affect directors and managers’ compensation. The financial analysts engage in what the agency theory calls the “earnings game”: Managers want to meet the financial forecasts of the analysts and analysts want to increase their compensation or business of the company that they follow. Following the CorpInterlock algorithm, we calculated a group of well-known social network metrics and integrated with economic variables using Logitboost. We used the results of the CorpInterlock algorithm to evaluate several trading strategies. We observed an improvement of the Sharpe ratio (risk-adjustment return) when we used “long only” trading strategies with the extended corporate interlock instead of the basic corporate interlock before the regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) was adopted (1998–2001). There was no major difference among the trading strategies after 2001. Additionally, the CorpInterlock algorithm implemented with Logitboost showed a significantly lower test error than when the CorpInterlock algorithm was implemented with logistic regression. We conclude that the CorpInterlock algorithm showed to be an effective forecasting algorithm and supported profitable trading strategies.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10618-008-0124-z,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paradigm shift has attracted the attention of many researchers, and there has been a tremendous increase in the awareness and activities of derivative securities. In particular there is a need to devise new techniques to address the limitations of traditional parametric pricing methods, which rely on assumptions and approximations to capture the complex dynamics of pricing processes. This paper proposes a novel non-parametric method using an ad-hoc recurrent neural network for estimating the future prices of war commodities such as gold and crude oil as well as currencies, which are increasingly gaining importance in the financial markets. The price predictions from the network, shown to be accurate and computationally efficient, are used in a hedging system to avoid unnecessary risks.

We find that the positive relation between the short-term price reaction and the ratio of annualized dividend amount to stock price is primarily limited to 96 small firms with high dividend ratios. The results suggest that the degree of short-term stock price underreaction to dividend events may not be as dramatic as previously believed. The results also show that the relations between the stock price response and firm size is different across different types of firms. Thus, drawing the conclusions from the whole dividend event data may leave some important information unexamined.

Although simple and easy to interpret, linear models require statistical assumptions that may be unrealistic. Neural networks are able to discriminate patterns that are not linearly separable, but the large number of parameters involved in a neural model often causes generalization problems. Wavelet networks are classification models that implement nonlinear discriminant surfaces as the superposition of dilated and translated versions of a single “mother wavelet” function. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to select dilation and translation parameters that yield a wavelet network classifier with good parsimony characteristics. The models are compared in a case study involving failed and continuing British firms in the period 1997–2000. Problems associated with over-parameterized neural networks are illustrated and the Optimal Brain Damage pruning technique is employed to obtain a parsimonious neural model.

We have previously shown that a residue and its sequence neighbor information can be used to predict DNA-binding candidates in a protein sequence. This sequence-based prediction method is applicable even if no sequence homology with a previously known DNA-binding protein is observed. Here we implement a neural network based algorithm to utilize evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for a better prediction of DNA-binding sites. Results An average of sensitivity and specificity using PSSMs is up to 8.7% better than the prediction with sequence information only. Much smaller data sets could be used to generate PSSM with minimal loss of prediction accuracy. Conclusion One problem in using PSSM-derived prediction is obtaining lengthy and time-consuming alignments against large sequence databases. In order to speed up the process of generating PSSMs, we tried to use different reference data sets (sequence space) against which a target protein is scanned for PSI-BLAST iterations. We find that a very small set of proteins can actually be used as such a reference data without losing much of the prediction value. This makes the process of generating PSSMs very rapid and even amenable to be used at a genome level. A web server has been developed to provide these predictions of DNA-binding sites for any new protein from its amino acid sequence.

It performs adaptive preprocessing by reorganizing its structure using the knowledge in the chromosomes matched to an operation environment. Introducing the concept of combining situation-awareness using the evolvable neural network and the evolutionary computing using the Genetic algorithm, the proposed method not only achieves highly efficient preprocessing for object recognition in varying illumination environments, but also solves the time-consuming problem of the evolutionary computing method. The proposed method has been tested and applied successfully to the preprocessing of face images. Face images are in spacially well-defined object class, and the features of face images are represented by multiple fiducial points, each of which is described by the Gabor wavelet transform.

The digital contracts calculated from the observed data based upon the parametric method are used as hints in the learning process, and then enable the DCD method to have superior pricing accuracy to the common data-driven method in practical applications. Some Monte Carlo simulation experiments are performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method not only has the advantages of generality and superior accuracy as the nonparametric method, but also the robust property to financial data with noise as the parametric method.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601597,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Morphology based analysis techniques for a classification of antegrade and retrograde atrial activation patterns can be used to cope with this problem. Here time-domain template matching techniques are known approaches. However, a time-domain representation of endocardial electrograms is not optimal for classification tasks as the dimensionality of the underlying signal space is high and features being irrelevant for a signal characterization are involved in the analysis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an enhanced morphological analysis tool for a classification of antegrade and retrograde atrial activation by using a transform domain representation of endocardial electrograms. For this, we applied an adapted wavelet-packet decomposition to extract discriminating features in endocardial electrograms representing antegrade and retrograde activation patterns. Further, a feed-forward neural network was utilized to produce a classification based on the extracted information. In using our hybrid method, no false classification of the physiological and pathological cardiac state was made. It is concluded that the proposed classification scheme represents a highly efficient approach for a classification of antegrade and retrograde atrial activation. © 2001 Biomedical Engineering Society.

Attempts to minimise losses due to this risk involve the lender in detection and mitigation activities which are expensive in terms of staff cost, and may be inconsistently performed. This paper explores the possibility of reducing both the cost of risk management, and the percentage of loan monies lost, by means of the introduction of Artificial Intelligence support for these risk management activities. A data sample drawn from a lending organisation’s operational databases is analysed by decision tree induction, in order to identify case features associated with instances of loss. A k-nearest neighbour algorithm is then devised, using these features both to rank cases in order of risk, and to enable case-based reasoning support to the formulation of a risk mitigation plan. A proposal is presented, for the trial implementation of the risk management support tools which have been created. This proposal provides for the critical evaluation and assessment of these tools, both against each other and against the status quo.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-0465-0_15,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

It is well known that controlling the design of a neural network can be cumbersome. Inaccuracies may lead to numerous problems in the application, such as higher errors due to local optima, overfitting and ill-conditioning of the network, especially when the number of observations is small. In this paper we provide a method to overcome these difficulties by regulating the flexibility of the network, and by rendering measures for validating the final network. In particular, a method is proposed to equilibrate the number of hidden neurons based on 5-fold cross-validation. In the validation process, the performance of the neural network is compared with a linear model using 5- fold cross-validation. In both case studies, the degree of monotonicity of the output of the neural network, with respect to each input variable, is calculated by numerical differentiation. The outcomes of this analysis are compared to what is expected from economic theory. Furthermore, a special class of monotonic neural networks and a corresponding training algorithm are developed. It is shown in the second case study that networks in this class have less tendency to overfitting than ordinary neural networks. The methods are illustrated in two case studies: predicting the price of housing in the Dutch city of Den Bosch; and the classification of bond ratings.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s005210050025,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The assessment of the regularity of gastric myoelectrical activity is of great clinical significance. The aim of this study was to develop an automated assessment method for the regularity of gastric myoelectrical activity from the surface electrogastrogram (EGG). The method proposed in this paper was based on the filter bank and neural network. First, the EGG signal was divided into frequency subbands using filter bank analysis. Second, a parameter called the subband energy ratio (SER) was computed for each subband signal. A multilayer perceptron neural network was then used to automatically classify the EGG signal into four categories: bradygastria, normal, tachygastria, and arrhythmia, using the SER as the input. The EGG recording was made using the standard method of electrogastrography by placing electrodes on the abdominal surface. The study was performed in 40 patients with various gastric motor disorders, ten healthy adults, and ten healthy children. The neural network was trained and tested using the EGG data obtained from the patients. The regularity of gastric myoelectrical activity was assessed based on the classification of the minute-by-minute EGG segments. Using the running spectral analysis method as a gold standard, the proposed automated method had an accuracy of 100% for the training set and 97% for the test set. It was concluded that the proposed method provides an accurate and automatic assessment of the regularity of gastric myoelectrical activity from the EGG. © 1999 Biomedical Engineering Society.

Thus the signals in such networks are analog, and the action of a synapse on a signal passing through it takes place in the form of a scalar product in L ^2 between the functional weight and the signal. In this paper, four classes of FANNs are introduced. They result from the solution of a nonparametric optimization problem in a generalized Fock space (GFS) of abstract Volterra series under interpolating or smoothing input-output training data constraints. Two of these classes of FANNs correspond to the interpolating case and are represented by what we call the (two-layer) optimal interpolating (OI) FANN and the optimal multilayer neural interpolating (OMNI) FANN . The remaining two classes correspond to the smoothing case. We name their representations as the (two-layer) optimal smoothing (OS) FANN and the optimal smoothing multilayer artificial neural (OSMAN) FANN . In addition to providing the background and the derivation of these FANNs, this paper presents a novel approach to their implementation. This approach does away with the computationally cumbersome use of functional weights. Instead, the effect of these weights is provided by linear time-invariant differential equation models of which those weights are impulse responses. These are implemented by a linear filter bank. This approach thus leads to simple and meaningful causal realizations of FANNs which we call Dynamical FANNs or simply D-FANNs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01202856,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The managerial hypothesis predicts the preference of internal to external financing if the manager’s utility function diverges from the owners’, to avoid additional monitoring. If internal funds are unavailable or insufficient, the management will prefer to issue debt instead of equity, because creditors usually have less chances of influencing managerial practice than the company’s owners. Issuing equity is thus seen as a positive signal, as it announces the reduction of information asymmetries (contrary to the pecking order theory). In the empirical section the degree of informational asymmetry and managerial discretion is described by such variables as block ownership or market segment.

This broad area had in the late 1970’s been labelled as “the one” field where AI would “with certainty and brilliance” make the deepest inroads, owing to the relatively high proportion of simple formalized heuristic knowledge and low labor productivity. Until about 1990 a large number of banks, insurance or finance companies embarked on internal developments, hiring a few key AI specialists for overall software architectural design and prototyping. Some specialist companies also emerged, offering generic approaches using mostly knowledge based or natural language based tools tailored to special needs of these generic areas (like insurance, asset allocation, formatted message understanding). It is estimated that more than 2000 prototypes were developed in industry worldwide, most with standard “shells”, and defined as a commercial effort of more than 6 man. months. For rather strange reasons, “open” AI applications in economics and finance was never a prime area for academic researchers in their academic capacities, and economics/management science by and large never showed any interest at that time.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-79283-0_2,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The experiences of financial instability has motivated a great interest in the question of bank solvency. Although several prediction models have been developed, their reliability is not enough. The paper presents a supervised neural networt model, based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), which was introduced by Stephen Grossberg in 1976. Also Fuzzy Sets Theory is used as processing scheme. The data sample have been taken from the Spanish bank crisis during 1978–1983. The model obtained is able to predict the complete learning data set in two different cases, data one year prior the failure and data two years prior the failure. The obtained results, using a set of test data, reach a high level of performance, with a low number of training cycles.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-56798-4_227,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a business environment, the techniques have been applied to predict bond ratings and stock price performance. In these applications, ANN techniques outperformed widely-used multivariate statistical techniques. The purpose of this paper is to compare the ANN method with the Discriminant Analysis (DA) method in order to understand the merits of ANN that are responsible for the higher level of performance. The paper provides an overview of the basic concepts of ANN techniques in order to enhance the understanding of this emerging technique. The similarities and differences between ANN and DA techniques in representing their models are described. This study also proposes a method to overcome the limitations of the ANN approach, Finally, a case study using a data set in a business environment demonstrates the superiority of ANN over DA as a method of classification of observations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1057/jors.1993.6,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The Operations Advisor (OA) enables managers to improve manufacturing strategy. It makes possible manufacturing policies that take full advantage of strategic interactions among capacity utilization, inventories, lead times, and unit costs. The Management Advisor (MA) values strategic business proposals (building a new plant, developing a new product, etc.). It helps managers assess the attractiveness of new business opportunities, and the impact of proposed changes in existing business policy. Artificial intelligence methodologies in the MA and the OA allow us to combine conventional analytic techniques with expert knowledge and experience. They also provide an extremely high level or user facilitation, control, and freedom from error, thus substantially improving overall business productivity. We begin with a description of the design strategy underlying these two generic AI-based management applications. Then we consider how this strategy is realized in the OA and the MA, and the productivity benefits it provides to users.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF00436713,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Unfortunately, this knowledge acquisition is almost invariably still carried out today by a combination of interviewing, data analysis [Pau and Valstorp, 1977], and data base retrieval techniques (see Chapter 8.5). The numerical model parameters can be re-estimated based on recent past observations by statistical parameter estimation techniques, econometrics, or by model identification algorithms, including adaptive control. In some instances, search may be added to said estimation or parameter fitting, as in Chapter 7. However, in some limited instances, and awaiting further progress in the machine learning area, some current recent techniques from these fields can in their own merit serve useful purposes for specific applications in economics and finance, but are still often disconnected from the larger knowledge acquisition requirements. It is the purpose of this Chapter to present two such techniques and related applications of: neural processing for learning and classification induction for knowledge acquisition and classification",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-76002-0_8,springer,finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
