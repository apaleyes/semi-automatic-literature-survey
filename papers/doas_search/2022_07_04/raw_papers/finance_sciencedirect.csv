Financial institutions use ML for building risk scorecards that support a range of credit-related decisions. Yet, the literature on fair ML in credit scoring is scarce. The paper makes three contributions. First, we revisit statistical fairness criteria and examine their adequacy for credit scoring. Second, we catalog algorithmic options for incorporating fairness goals in the ML model development pipeline. Last, we empirically compare different fairness processors in a profit-oriented credit scoring context using real-world data. The empirical results substantiate the evaluation of fairness measures, identify suitable options to implement fair credit scoring, and clarify the profit-fairness trade-off in lending decisions. We find that multiple fairness criteria can be approximately satisfied at once and recommend separation as a proper criterion for measuring the fairness of a scorecard. We also find fair in-processors to deliver a good balance between profit and fairness and show that algorithmic discrimination can be reduced to a reasonable level at a relatively low cost.

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Within operations research, over the last 25 years the use of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), known as reinforcement learning in many disciplines, to solve these types of problems has increased in popularity. These efforts have resulted in the successful deployment of ADP-generated decision policies for driver scheduling in the trucking industry, locomotive planning and management, and managing high-value spare parts in manufacturing. In this article we present the first review of applications of ADP within a defence context, specifically focusing on those which provide decision support to military or civilian leadership. This article’s main contributions are twofold. First, we review 18 decision support applications, spanning the spectrum of force development, generation, and employment, that use an ADP-based strategy and for each highlight how its ADP algorithm was designed, evaluated, and the results achieved. Second, based on the trends and gaps identified we discuss five topics relevant to applying ADP to decision support problems within defence: the classes of problems studied; best practices to evaluate ADP-generated policies; advantages of designing policies that are incremental versus complete overhauls when compared to currently practiced policies; the robustness of policies as scenarios change, such as a shift from high to low intensity conflict; and sequential decision problems not yet studied within defence that may benefit from ADP.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At the same time, CNNs are very demanding in terms of the hardware and time cost of a computing system, which considerably restricts their practical use, e.g., in embedded systems, real-time systems, and mobile volatile devices. The goal of this paper is to reduce the resources required to build and operate CNNs. To achieve this goal, a CNN architecture based on Residue Number System (RNS) and the new Chinese Remainder Theorem with fractions is proposed. The new architecture gives an efficient solution to the main problem of RNSs associated with restoring the number from its residues, which determines the main contribution to the CNN structure. In accordance with the results of hardware simulation on Kintex7 xc7k70tfbg484-2 FPGA, the use of RNS in the convolutional layer of a neural network reduces hardware cost by 32.6% compared to the traditional approach based on the binary number system.

This training method comprises a population-based meta-heuristic optimization with defined individual encoding and objective function related to the AHN-model, an implementation in parallel-computing, and a stochastic learning approach for consuming large data.

In common terminology, when we engage with an object, e.g. Online Games, Social Networking Websites, Mobile Apps, etc., there is a degree of interest between us and the object. But, owing to the lack of a procedure that can quantify interest, we are unable to tell by how ‘much’ of a factor are we interested in the object. In other words, can we find a number for someone’s interest? In this article, we propose a method that uses the principle of Bayesian Inference to tackle this issue. We formulate the “interest estimation problem” as a state estimation problem to deduce interest (in any object) indirectly from user activity. Activity caused by interest is computed through a subjective–objectiveweighted approach, then using indirect inference rules, we provide numerical estimates of interest. To do that, we model the dynamics of interest through the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. To further enhance the base performance, we draw inspiration from Stochastic Volatility models from Finance. Subsequently, drawing upon a self-adapting transfer function, we provide an avant-garde statistical procedure to model the transformation of interest into activity. The individual contributions are then combined and a solution is provided via Particle filters. Validation of the method is done in two ways. (1) Experimentation is performed on real datasets. Through numerical investigation we have found that the method shows good performance. (2) We implement the framework as a Web application and deploy it on an Enterprise Service Bus. The framework has been successfully hosted on a Cloud based Virtualized testbed consisting of several Virtual Machines constructed over XENServer as the underlying hypervisor. Through this experimental setup, we show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in estimating interest, at much the same time, we demonstrate the viability of the method in practical cloud based deployment scenarios.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Natural resources, such as energy and water, enable economy growth and support quality of life. The Water-Energy Nexus is considered as one of the most important multidisciplinary challenges [2] that the global growing water market [3] has to face in the forthcoming years. Currently, many water systems are not managed sustainably enough. Water Utilities face other challenges, such as infrastructure aging and poor cost-recovery, leading to a lack of finance for O&M (Operation and Maintenance). Energy is required in all stages of water production and distribution, from pumping and treatment to transportation. Energy costs are a top-of-mind concern for water utilities, regardless of geography, size and level of water network efficiency [4]. On the other hand, Water Utilities are having a hard time to either improve their services or expand their network to unserved neighborhoods in developing countries.
                  The current trend of water transmission system to the creation of DMAs (District Metered Areas) offers great possibilities of non-structural solutions that use existing data and transform them into useful information to support decision making. The Smart Metering and the use of large amounts of data from a network enhance the use of software for decision support, but it is not the only way. Smart Solutions can also be applied to networks with less recorded data, which would enhance operators’ knowledge to these data, turn them into useful information for decision-making either for the operation or the maintenance and network design. In this scope, a Smart Solution is presented. It is developed combining key factors of the energy consumption and the water supply into water networks management to obtain improvements from both water and energy fields. This non-structural solution increases resource efficiency and environmental performance of water distribution networks by using data acquisition and geographical visualization (real time & historical), weather and water demand forecasting, detection of networks events and hydraulic simulation of the network, and finally through a decision support system based on machine learning (pattern recognition and business rules techniques).
                  As a conclusion, a non-structural solution for the Nexus issues can have a great impact on several matters (climate change, carbon footprint, WUs balance sheets, and water losses) with reasonable investment either in smart metering or networks with only a few sensors measuring.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Unfortunately, almost all of the existing approaches adopt black box models and mechanisms that do not give any justifications to analysts. Also, the development of such methods is stifled by limited Internet banking data availability for the scientific community. In this paper we describe BankSealer, a decision support system for online banking fraud analysis and investigation. During a training phase, BankSealer builds easy-to-understand models for each customer's spending habits, based on past transactions. First, it quantifies the anomaly of each transaction with respect to the customer historical profile. Second, it finds global clusters of customers with similar spending habits. Third, it uses a temporal threshold system that measures the anomaly of the current spending pattern of each customer, with respect to his or her past spending behavior. With this threefold profiling approach, it mitigates the under-training due to the lack of historical data for building well-trained profiles, and the evolution of users' spending habits over time. At runtime, BankSealer supports analysts by ranking new transactions that deviate from the learned profiles, with an output that has an easily understandable, immediate statistical meaning.
                  Our evaluation on real data, based on fraud scenarios built in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical, real-world attacks (e.g., credential stealing, banking trojan activity, and frauds repeated over time), shows that our approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, we measure the effectiveness, the computational resource requirements and the capabilities of BankSealer to mitigate the problem of users that performed a low number of transactions. Our system ranks frauds and anomalies with up to 98% detection rate and with a maximum daily computation time of 4 min.

Recombinant and highly purified allergens belonging to different allergenic sources (inhalants, food, latex and hymenoptera) are present in the array.

A large number of complex and heterogeneous relationships among these components has emerged, such that sometimes these interactions cannot be effectively managed by the allergist.

The input data included the patient’s ID and disease(s), the results of either a skin prick test or specific IgE assays and ISAC results. The output was a medical report.
                  
                     Results The ES was first validated using artificial and real life cases and passed all in silico validations. Then, the opinions of allergists with experience in molecular diagnostics were compared with the ES reports. The Allergenius reports included all of the allergists’ opinions and considerations, as well as any additional information.
                  
                     Conclusions Allergenius is a trustable ES dedicated to molecular tests for allergy. In the present version, it provides a powerful method to understand ISAC results and to obtain a comprehensive interpretation of the patient’s IgE profiling.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Previous testing has shown that asymmetric GARCH models outperform other GARCH family models with regard to volatility prediction. Utilizing this information, three popular Neural Network models (Feed-Forward with Back Propagation, Generalized Regression, and Radial Basis Function) are implemented to help improve the performance of the GJR(1,1) method for estimating volatility over the next forty-four trading days. During training and testing, four different economic cycles have been considered between 1997-2011 to represent real and contemporary periods of market calm and crisis. In addition to stress testing for different neural network architectures to assess their performance under various turmoil and normal situations in the U.S. market, their synergy along with another econometric model is also accessed.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To maintain these levels of trust they have been forced to make significant adjustments to economic structures, in efforts to recoup their investments and maintain the loyalty of their customers. To achieve these objectives, the implementation of electronic banking for customers has been considered a successful strategy. The use of electronic banking in Spain in the last decade has been fostered due to its many advantages, giving rise to real integration of channels in financial institutions. This paper reviews different methods and techniques to determine which variables could be the most important to financial institutions in order to predict the likely levels of trust among electronic banking users including socio-demographic, economic, financial and behavioural strategic variables that entities have in their databases. To do so, the most recent advances in machine learning and soft-computing have been used, including a new selection operator for multiobjective genetic algorithms. The results obtained by the algorithms were validated by an expert committee, ranking the quality of them. The new methodology proposed, obtained the best results in terms of optimisation as well as the highest punctuation given by the experts.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The system comprises three stages. First, the wavelet transform using the Haar wavelet is applied to decompose the stock price time series and thus eliminate noise. Second, the RNN, which has a simple architecture and uses numerous fundamental and technical indicators, is applied to construct the input features chosen via Stepwise Regression-Correlation Selection (SRCS). Third, the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is utilized to optimize the RNN weights and biases under a parameter space design. For illustration and evaluation purposes, this study refers to the simulation results of several international stock markets, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA), London FTSE-100 Index (FTSE), Tokyo Nikkei-225 Index (Nikkei), and Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX). As these simulation results demonstrate, the proposed system is highly promising and can be implemented in a real-time trading system for forecasting stock prices and maximizing profits.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We train and implement three neural networks to decide whether to approve or reject a credit application. Credit scoring and evaluation is one of the key analytical techniques in credit risk evaluation which has been an active research area in financial risk management. The neural networks are trained using real world credit application cases from the German credit approval datasets which has 1000 cases; each case with 24 numerical attributes; based on which an application is accepted or rejected. Nine learning schemes with different training-to-validation data ratios have been investigated, and a comparison between their implementation results has been provided. Experimental results will suggest which neural network model, and under which learning scheme, can the proposed credit risk evaluation system deliver optimum performance; where it may be used efficiently, and quickly in automatic processing of credit applications.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Various techniques have been employed in this area, ranging from statistical ones such as multiple discriminate analysis (MDA), Logit, etc. to machine learning ones like neural networks (NN), support vector machine (SVM), etc. Case-based reasoning (CBR), which is one of the key methodologies for problem-solving, has not won enough focus in financial distress prediction since 1996. In this study, outranking relations (OR), including strict difference, weak difference, and indifference, between cases on each feature are introduced to build up a new feature-based similarity measure mechanism in the principle of k-nearest neighbors. It is different from traditional distance-based similarity mechanisms and those based on NN, fuzzy set theory, decision tree (DT), etc. Accuracy of the CBR prediction method based on OR, which is called as OR-CBR, is determined directly by such four types of parameters as difference parameter, indifference parameter, veto parameter, and neighbor parameter. It is described in detail that what the model of OR-CBR is from various aspects such as its developed background, formalization of the specific model, and implementation of corresponding algorithm. With three year’s real-world data from Chinese listed companies, experimental results indicate that OR-CBR outperforms MDA, Logit, NN, SVM, DT, Basic CBR, and Grey CBR in financial distress prediction, under the assessment of leave-one-out cross-validation and the process of Max normalization. It means that OR-CBR may be a preferred model dealing with financial distress prediction in China.",finance,'finance' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Each model is implemented by various neural network (NN) architectures: global model by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), feedback model by a recurrent neural network (RNN) and smoothed-piecewise model by a mixture of experts (MoE) structure. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed by using real world finance data: 12 years data of Istanbul stock exchange (ISE) index (XU100) from 1990 to 2002. A conventional exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) volatility model is also implemented for comparison purpose. The comparison for each model is done based on well-known criterions of index return series of market: hit rate (H
