is known about the occurrence of attacks on machine learning systems in the
wild. In this paper, we report on a quantitative study with 139 industrial
practitioners. We analyze attack occurrence and concern and evaluate
statistical hypotheses on factors influencing threat perception and exposure.
Our results shed light on real-world attacks on deployed machine learning. On
the organizational level, while we find no predictors for threat exposure in
our sample, the amount of implement defenses depends on exposure to threats or
expected likelihood to become a target. We also provide a detailed analysis of
practitioners' replies on the relevance of individual machine learning attacks,
unveiling complex concerns like unreliable decision making, business
information leakage, and bias introduction into models. Finally, we find that
on the individual level, prior knowledge about machine learning security
influences threat perception. Our work paves the way for more research about
adversarial machine learning in practice, but yields also insights for
regulation and auditing.",arxiv,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

recommendation models in local clients, which reduces the burden of the
cloud-based recommenders and simultaneously incorporates more real-time user
features. Nevertheless, the cloud-based recommendation in the industry is still
very important considering its powerful model capacity and the efficient
candidate generation from the billion-scale item pool. Previous attempts to
integrate the merits of both paradigms mainly resort to a sequential mechanism,
which builds the on-device recommender on top of the cloud-based
recommendation. However, such a design is inflexible when user interests
dramatically change:
  the on-device model is stuck by the limited item cache while the cloud-based
recommendation based on the large item pool do not respond without the new
re-fresh feedback.
  To overcome this issue, we propose a meta controller to dynamically manage
the collaboration between the on-device recommender and the cloud-based
recommender, and introduce a novel efficient sample construction from the
causal perspective to solve the dataset absence issue of meta controller. On
the basis of the counterfactual samples and the extended training, extensive

  Machine Tools","Prediction of Remaining Useful Lifetime(RUL) in the modern manufacturing and
automation workplace for machines and tools is essential in Industry 4.0. This
is clearly evident as continuous tool wear, or worse, sudden machine breakdown
will lead to various manufacturing failures which would clearly cause economic
loss. With the availability of deep learning approaches, the great potential
and prospect of utilizing these for RUL prediction have resulted in several
models which are designed driven by operation data of manufacturing machines.
Current efforts in these which are based on fully-supervised models heavily
rely on the data labeled with their RULs. However, the required RUL prediction
data (i.e. the annotated and labeled data from faulty and/or degraded machines)
can only be obtained after the machine breakdown occurs. The scarcity of broken
machines in the modern manufacturing and automation workplace in real-world
situations increases the difficulty of getting sufficient annotated and labeled
data. In contrast, the data from healthy machines is much easier to be
collected. Noting this challenge and the potential for improved effectiveness
and applicability, we thus propose (and also fully develop) a method based on
the idea of masked autoencoders which will utilize unlabeled data to do
self-supervision. In thus the work here, a noteworthy masked self-supervised
learning approach is developed and utilized. This is designed to seek to build
a deep learning model for RUL prediction by utilizing unlabeled data. The
experiments to verify the effectiveness of this development are implemented on

machine learning approach for which we train a regression forest to predict the
speed-up (or slow-down) provided by using local cuts. We demonstrate with an

completely suppressing the increase in error with the increase in interval

unrealistic. The development of a practical CFD acceleration methodology that

developing a realistic ML strategy based on a physics-informed transfer

applied to the receiver only, which has little air interface impact, it
provides approximately 25\% SE gain at a moderate feedback overhead level. It
is feasible to deploy it in current 5G networks during 5G evolutions. For the

additional performance gain on SE, which is 6% -- 26% compared with DL-based

neural networks into lightweight disjoint smaller components for pipelined

semantic and layer-wise splitting. The former partitions a neural network into
parallel disjoint models that produce a part of the result, whereas the latter

approach so far is to develop individual algorithms for each domain and each

separate model from scratch for every task. Deriving a unified foundation is
challenging due to (i) the potentially unlimited set of downstream domains and

We thus build our foundation upon M6, an existing large-scale industrial
pretrained language model similar to GPT-3 and T5, and leverage M6's pretrained
ability for sample-efficient downstream adaptation, by representing user
behavior data as plain texts and converting the tasks to either language
understanding or generation. To deal with a tight hardware budget, we propose
an improved version of prompt tuning that outperforms fine-tuning with
negligible 1\% task-specific parameters, and employ techniques such as late
interaction, early exiting, parameter sharing, and pruning to further reduce
the inference time and the model size. We demonstrate the foundation model's

creation of full ML models similarly to established ML frameworks. We run a
series of benchmarks studying memory and performance and compare our solution

an exhaustive visual inspection impossible and therefore automated methods
based on machine-learning must be deployed for this purpose. This is
particulary the case in seismic signal processing. Engineers/geophysicists have
to deal with millions of seismic time series. Finding the sub-surface

different steps of noise attenuation. Each denoise step is then ideally
followed by a quality control (QC) stage performed by means of human expertise.
To learn a quality control classifier in a supervised manner, labeled training
data must be available, but collecting the labels from human experts is
extremely time-consuming. We therefore propose a novel active learning
methodology to sequentially select the most relevant data, which are then given
back to a human expert for labeling. Beyond the application in geophysics, the

achieves better or competitive performance but also is data- and

speeches are from the same speaker, mainly focus on verification accuracy while
ignoring inference speed. However, in real applications, both inference speed
and verification accuracy are essential. This study proposes cross-sequential
re-parameterization (CS-Rep), a novel topology re-parameterization strategy for
multi-type networks, to increase the inference speed and verification accuracy
of models. CS-Rep solves the problem that existing re-parameterization methods
are unsuitable for typical ASV backbones. When a model applies CS-Rep, the
training-period network utilizes a multi-branch topology to capture speaker
information, whereas the inference-period model converts to a time-delay neural
network (TDNN)-like plain backbone with stacked TDNN layers to achieve the fast
inference speed. Based on CS-Rep, an improved TDNN with friendly test and
deployment called Rep-TDNN is proposed. Compared with the state-of-the-art
model ECAPA-TDNN, which is highly recognized in the industry, Rep-TDNN
increases the actual inference speed by about 50% and reduces the EER by 10%.

integrated on all types of platforms, from data centers to embedded systems
including low-power processors and, recently, FPGAs. Neural Networks (NN) are
expected to become ubiquitous in IoT systems by transforming all sorts of
real-world applications, including applications in the safety-critical and
security-sensitive domains. However, the underlying hardware security
vulnerabilities of embedded NN implementations remain unaddressed. In
particular, embedded DNN implementations are vulnerable to Side-Channel
Analysis (SCA) attacks, which are especially important in the IoT and edge
computing contexts where an attacker can usually gain physical access to the
targeted device. A research field has therefore emerged and is rapidly growing
in terms of the use of SCA including timing, electromagnetic attacks and power
attacks to target NN embedded implementations. Since 2018, research papers have
shown that SCA enables an attacker to recover inference models architectures
and parameters, to expose industrial IP and endangers data confidentiality and
privacy. Without a complete review of this emerging field in the literature so
far, this paper surveys state-of-the-art physical SCA attacks relative to the
implementation of embedded DNNs on micro-controllers and FPGAs in order to

However, their deployment in unstructured environments remains an open problem.
To deal with the variety, complexity, and uncertainty of real-world
manipulation tasks, it is essential to develop a flexible framework with
reduced assumptions on the environment characteristics. In recent years,
reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great results for single-arm robotic
manipulation. However, research focusing on dual-arm manipulation is still
rare. From a classical control perspective, solving such tasks often involves
complex modeling of interactions between two manipulators and the objects
encountered in the tasks, as well as the two robots coupling at a control
level. Instead, in this work, we explore the applicability of model-free RL to
dual-arm assembly. As we aim to contribute towards an approach that is not
limited to dual-arm assembly, but dual-arm manipulation in general, we keep
modeling efforts at a minimum. Hence, to avoid modeling the interaction between
the two robots and the used assembly tools, we present a modular approach with
two decentralized single-arm controllers which are coupled using a single
centralized learned policy. We reduce modeling effort to a minimum by using
sparse rewards only. Our architecture enables successful assembly and simple
transfer from simulation to the real world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the framework on dual-arm peg-in-hole and analyze sample efficiency and success
rates for different action spaces. Moreover, we compare results on different

counteract the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking great interest from academia,
industry and public administrations worldwide. While most solutions have dealt

continuous monitoring of public spaces and help trigger effective
countermeasures. This work presents milliTRACE-IR, a joint mmWave radar and
infrared imaging sensing system performing unobtrusive and privacy preserving
human body temperature screening and contact tracing in indoor spaces.
milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mmWave radars and
infrared thermal cameras. It achieves fully automated measurement of distancing
and body temperature, by jointly tracking the subjects's faces in the thermal
camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system.
Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body
temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently
traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars. When
entering a new room, a subject is re-identified among several other individuals
by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep
neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final
re-identification tool. Experimental results, obtained from a real

distance/trajectory estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective
for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring

memory-bound workloads is insufficient to amortize the cost of memory access.
Fundamentally addressing this data movement bottleneck requires a paradigm
where the memory system assumes an active role in computing by integrating
processing capabilities. This paradigm is known as processing-in-memory (PIM).
Recent research explores different forms of PIM architectures, motivated by the
emergence of new technologies that integrate memory with a logic layer, where
processing elements can be easily placed. Past works evaluate these
architectures in simulation or, at best, with simplified hardware prototypes.
In contrast, the UPMEM company has designed and manufactured the first

However, flame imaging is not a common sensing modality in engine combustors

the acoustic pressure time series is a more feasible modality for data

Feature importance methods (e.g. gain and SHAP) are among the most popular

methods (explaining individual predictions) has been studied before, there is
yet a knowledge gap about the stability of global features importance methods
(explanations for the whole model). Additionally, there is no study that

stability of global feature importance methods through comprehensive

Hence, an effective diagnostic approach that can work well in such situation is

pre-trained to be a fault feature extractor. In the second stage, a

for clustering. It is first initialized with available labeled data and then
used to simultaneously optimize the clustering label assignment and make the
feature space to be more clustering-friendly. To tackle the phenomenon of
overfitting, virtual adversarial training (VAT) is introduced as a
regularization term in this stage. In the third stage, pseudo labels are
obtained by the high-quality results of SSIDEC. The labeled dataset can be
augmented by these pseudo-labeled data and then leveraged to train a bearing

healthcare, manufacturing, automotive or aerospace, it is often challenging to
bridge the gap between an apparently optimal policy learnt by an agent and its

Broadly speaking RL agents face two kinds of uncertainty, 1. aleatoric
uncertainty, which reflects randomness or noise in the dynamics of the world,
and 2. epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the bounded knowledge of the agent

different implications for the evaluation of performance and the level of risk

  Prediction","Industrial recommender systems are frequently tasked with approximating
probabilities for multiple, often closely related, user actions. For example,
predicting if a user will click on an advertisement and if they will then
purchase the advertised product. The conceptual similarity between these tasks
has promoted the use of multi-task learning: a class of algorithms that aim to
bring positive inductive transfer from related tasks. Here, we empirically
evaluate multi-task learning approaches with neural networks for an online
advertising task. Specifically, we consider approximating the probability of
post-click conversion events (installs) (CVR) for mobile app advertising on a
large-scale advertising platform, using the related click events (CTR) as an
auxiliary task. We use an ablation approach to systematically study recent
approaches that incorporate both multitask learning and ""entire space modeling""
which train the CVR on all logged examples rather than learning a conditional
likelihood of conversion given clicked. Based on these results we show that
several different approaches result in similar levels of positive transfer from
the data-abundant CTR task to the CVR task and offer some insight into how the
multi-task design choices address the two primary problems affecting the CVR
task: data sparsity and data bias. Our findings add to the growing body of

two state-of-the-art algorithms, namely Gaussian process and lower upper bound

prerequisite for GDPR compliance checking is to verify whether the content of a

privacy policies might result in large fines on violating organization as well
as incomplete privacy-related software specifications. Manual completeness
checking is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose
AI-based automation for the completeness checking of privacy policies. Through
systematic qualitative methods, we first build two artifacts to characterize

scheduling vehicles among multiple sites in order to minimize the cost when
delivery orders are not known a priori. Although DPDP plays an important role
in modern logistics and supply chain management, state-of-the-art DPDP
algorithms are still limited on their solution quality and efficiency. In
practice, they fail to provide a scalable solution as the numbers of vehicles

Spatial-Temporal Aided Double Deep Graph Network (ST-DDGN), to solve
industry-scale DPDP. In our method, the delivery demands are first forecast
using spatial-temporal prediction method, which guides the neural network to
perceive spatial-temporal distribution of delivery demand when dispatching
vehicles. Besides, the relationships of individuals such as vehicles are
modelled by establishing a graph-based value function. ST-DDGN incorporates
attention-based graph embedding with Double DQN (DDQN). As such, it can make
the inference across vehicles more efficiently compared with traditional
methods. Our method is entirely data driven and thus adaptive, i.e., the
relational representation of adjacent vehicles can be learned and corrected by
ST-DDGN from data periodically. We have conducted extensive experiments over
real-world data to evaluate our solution. The results show that ST-DDGN reduces
11.27% number of the used vehicles and decreases 13.12% total transportation
cost on average over the strong baselines, including the heuristic algorithm

the high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these
tasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies
in predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing
feature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order
cross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing
methods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model
architecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with
equal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel

different cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head

It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. We propose a hybrid

of steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern
division and health evaluation. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is

various deep Click-Through Rate (CTR) models are deployed in the commercial
systems by industrial companies. To achieve better performance, it is necessary
to train the deep CTR models on huge volume of training data efficiently, which
makes speeding up the training process an essential problem. Different from the
models with dense training data, the training data for CTR models is usually
high-dimensional and sparse. To transform the high-dimensional sparse input
into low-dimensional dense real-value vectors, almost all deep CTR models adopt
the embedding layer, which easily reaches hundreds of GB or even TB. Since a
single GPU cannot afford to accommodate all the embedding parameters, when
performing distributed training, it is not reasonable to conduct the
data-parallelism only. Therefore, existing distributed training platforms for
recommendation adopt model-parallelism. Specifically, they use CPU (Host)
memory of servers to maintain and update the embedding parameters and utilize
GPU worker to conduct forward and backward computations. Unfortunately, these
platforms suffer from two bottlenecks: (1) the latency of pull \& push
operations between Host and GPU; (2) parameters update and synchronization in
the CPU servers. To address such bottlenecks, in this paper, we propose the
ScaleFreeCTR: a MixCache-based distributed training system for CTR models.
Specifically, in SFCTR, we also store huge embedding table in CPU but utilize
GPU instead of CPU to conduct embedding synchronization efficiently. To reduce
the latency of data transfer between both GPU-Host and GPU-GPU, the MixCache

substantial costs associated with maintenance decisions that are either too

solutions to challenging domains such as robotics. Model-based RL shows the
prospect of being more sample-efficient than model-free methods in terms of

unseen situations. In the more recent past, model-based methods have shown
superior results compared to model-free methods in some challenging domains
with non-linear state transitions. At the same time, it has become apparent
that RL is not market-ready yet and that many real-world applications are going
to require model-based approaches, because model-free methods are too
sample-inefficient and show poor performance in early stages of training. The
latter is particularly important in industry, e.g. in production systems that

Recently, researchers in academia and industry have contributed several

However, little effort has gone towards understanding deepfake videos in the
wild, leading to a limited understanding of the real-world applicability of
research contributions in this space. Even if detection schemes are shown to
perform well on existing datasets, it is unclear how well the methods
generalize to real-world deepfakes. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we make
the following contributions: First, we collect and present the largest dataset
of deepfake videos in the wild, containing 1,869 videos from YouTube and
Bilibili, and extract over 4.8M frames of content. Second, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the growth patterns, popularity, creators,
manipulation strategies, and production methods of deepfake content in the

drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world

industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our

a recommender system such that the attacker-chosen target items are recommended
to many users. To achieve this goal, our attack injects fake users with
carefully crafted ratings to a recommender system. Specifically, we formulate
our attack as an optimization problem, such that the injected ratings would
maximize the number of normal users to whom the target items are recommended.
However, it is challenging to solve the optimization problem because it is a
non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop
multiple techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. Our
experimental results on three real-world datasets, including small and large
datasets, show that our attack is effective and outperforms existing attacks.
Moreover, we attempt to detect fake users via statistical analysis of the
rating patterns of normal and fake users. Our results show that our attack is
still effective and outperforms existing attacks even if such a detector is
deployed.",arxiv,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

benefits of code reviews are widely recognized and include better code quality
and lower likelihood of introducing bugs. However, since code review is a
manual activity it comes at the cost of spending developers' time on reviewing
their teammates' code.
  Our goal is to make the first step towards partially automating the code
review process, thus, possibly reducing the manual costs associated with it. We
focus on both the contributor and the reviewer sides of the process, by
training two different Deep Learning architectures. The first one learns code
changes performed by developers during real code review activities, thus
providing the contributor with a revised version of her code implementing code
transformations usually recommended during code review before the code is even
submitted for review. The second one automatically provides the reviewer
commenting on a submitted code with the revised code implementing her comments
expressed in natural language.
  The empirical evaluation of the two models shows that, on the contributor
side, the trained model succeeds in replicating the code transformations
applied during code reviews in up to 16% of cases. On the reviewer side, the
model can correctly implement a comment provided in natural language in up to
31% of cases. While these results are encouraging, more research is needed to
make these models usable by developers.",arxiv,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the application of DL in the domain of

taxonomized the identified faults through several rounds of discussions. The
resulting taxonomy is validated using an online survey with 19

when deploying a large scale fleet of robot to real-world applications. This
paper proposes a decentralized partially observable multi-agent path planning
with evolutionary reinforcement learning (MAPPER) method to learn an effective
local planning policy in mixed dynamic environments. Reinforcement
learning-based methods usually suffer performance degradation on long-horizon
tasks with goal-conditioned sparse rewards, so we decompose the long-range
navigation task into many easier sub-tasks under the guidance of a global
planner, which increases agents' performance in large environments. Moreover,
most existing multi-agent planning approaches assume either perfect information
of the surrounding environment or homogeneity of nearby dynamic agents, which
may not hold in practice. Our approach models dynamic obstacles' behavior with
an image-based representation and trains a policy in mixed dynamic environments
without homogeneity assumption. To ensure multi-agent training stability and
performance, we propose an evolutionary training approach that can be easily
scaled to large and complex environments. Experiments show that MAPPER is able

a game-theoretic model,where each mobile edge device aims at maximizing the
accuracy of its local model at the same time limiting the overhead of
participating in CDL. We analyze the Nash Equilibrium in anN-player static game

An efficient backbone combining multi-scale feature operations, 2) a more

applications, the choice of which edges to use for computation is the first
step in any graph learning process. Interestingly, there are often many types
of similarity available to choose as the edges between nodes, and the choice of
edges can drastically affect the performance of downstream semi-supervised
learning systems. However, despite the importance of graph design, most of the
literature assumes that the graph is static. In this work, we present Grale, a
scalable method we have developed to address the problem of graph design for
graphs with billions of nodes. Grale operates by fusing together different
measures of(potentially weak) similarity to create a graph which exhibits high
task-specific homophily between its nodes. Grale is designed for running on
large datasets. We have deployed Grale in more than 20 different industrial
settings at Google, including datasets which have tens of billions of nodes,
and hundreds of trillions of potential edges to score. By employing locality
sensitive hashing techniques,we greatly reduce the number of pairs that need to
be scored, allowing us to learn a task specific model and build the associated
nearest neighbor graph for such datasets in hours, rather than the days or even
weeks that might be required otherwise. We illustrate this through a case study

predictive accuracy in the task of sequential recommendations, particularly for
modeling long-term item dependencies. However, typical MNR requires complex
memory access operations, i.e., both writing and reading via a controller
(e.g., RNN) at every time step. Those frequent operations will dramatically
increase the network training time, resulting in the difficulty in being
deployed on industrial-scale recommender systems. In this paper, we present a
novel general Chunk framework to accelerate MNR significantly. Specifically,
our framework divides proximal information units into chunks, and performs
memory access at certain time steps, whereby the number of memory operations
can be greatly reduced. We investigate two ways to implement effective
chunking, i.e., PEriodic Chunk (PEC) and Time-Sensitive Chunk (TSC), to
preserve and recover important recurrent signals in the sequence. Since
chunk-accelerated MNR models take into account more proximal information units
than that from a single timestep, it can remove the influence of noise in the
item sequence to a large extent, and thus improve the stability of MNR. In this
way, the proposed chunk mechanism can lead to not only faster training and
prediction, but even slightly better results. The experimental results on three
real-world datasets (weishi, ml-10M and ml-latest) show that our chunk
framework notably reduces the running time (e.g., with up to 7x for training &

Adversarial examples (AEs) represent a typical and important type of defects

decisions. Such defects occur through either intentional attack or
physical-world noise perceived by input sensors, potentially hindering further
industry deployment. The intrinsic uncertainty nature of deep learning
decisions can be a fundamental reason for its incorrect behavior. Although some
testing, adversarial attack and defense techniques have been recently proposed,
it still lacks a systematic study to uncover the relationship between AEs and
DL uncertainty. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study towards bridging

in differentiating benign examples (BEs) and AEs, which enables to characterize
the uncertainty patterns of input data. Then, we identify and categorize the
uncertainty patterns of BEs and AEs, and find that while BEs and AEs generated
by existing methods do follow common uncertainty patterns, some other
uncertainty patterns are largely missed. Based on this, we propose an automated
testing technique to generate multiple types of uncommon AEs and BEs that are
largely missed by existing techniques. Our further evaluation reveals that the

latency algorithms leveraging machine learning methods. This need for real time
processing can be seen in industries ranging from developing neural network
based pre-distortors for enhanced mobile broadband to designing FPGA-based
triggers in major scientific efforts by CERN for particle physics. In this
thesis, we explore how niche domains can benefit vastly if we look at neurons
as a unique boolean function of the form $f:B^{I} \rightarrow B^{O}$, where $B
= \{0,1\}$. We focus on how to design topologies that complement such a view of
neurons, how to automate such a strategy of neural network design, and
inference of such networks on Xilinx FPGAs. Major hardware borne constraints
arise when designing topologies that view neurons as unique boolean functions.
Fundamentally, realizing such topologies on hardware asserts a strict limit on
the 'fan-in' bits of a neuron due to the doubling of permutations possible with
every increment in input bit-length. We address this limit by exploring
different methods of implementing sparsity and explore activation quantization.
Further, we develop a library that supports training a neural network with
custom sparsity and quantization. This library also supports conversion of
trained Sparse Quantized networks from PyTorch to VERILOG code which is then
synthesized using Vivado, all of which is part of the LogicNet tool-flow. To
aid faster prototyping, we also support calculation of the worst-case hardware
cost of any given topology. We hope that our insights into the behavior of
extremely sparse quantized neural networks are of use to the research community

amount of data. In such an environment, the controlling systems need to be
intelligent enough to deal with a vast amount of data to detect defects in a
real-time process. Driven by such a need, artificial intelligence models such
as deep learning have to be deployed into IIoT systems. However, learning and
using deep learning models are computationally expensive, so an IoT device with
limited computational power could not run such models. To tackle this issue,
edge intelligence had emerged as a new paradigm towards running Artificial
Intelligence models on edge devices. Although a considerable amount of studies
have been proposed in this area, the research is still in the early stages. In
this paper, we propose a novel edge-based multi-phase pruning pipelines to
ensemble learning on IIoT devices. In the first phase, we generate a diverse
ensemble of pruned models, then we apply integer quantisation, next we prune
the generated ensemble using a clustering-based technique. Finally, we choose
the best representative from each generated cluster to be deployed to a
distributed IoT environment. On CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, our proposed approach

  Industrial Images","As machine learning for images becomes democratized in the Software 2.0 era,
one of the serious bottlenecks is securing enough labeled data for training.
This problem is especially critical in a manufacturing setting where smart
factories rely on machine learning for product quality control by analyzing
industrial images. Such images are typically large and may only need to be
partially analyzed where only a small portion is problematic (e.g., identifying
defects on a surface). Since manual labeling these images is expensive, weak
supervision is an attractive alternative where the idea is to generate weak
labels that are not perfect, but can be produced at scale. Data programming is
a recent paradigm in this category where it uses human knowledge in the form of
labeling functions and combines them into a generative model. Data programming
has been successful in applications based on text or structured data and can
also be applied to images usually if one can find a way to convert them into
structured data. In this work, we expand the horizon of data programming by
directly applying it to images without this conversion, which is a common
scenario for industrial applications. We propose Inspector Gadget, an image
labeling system that combines crowdsourcing, data augmentation, and data
programming to produce weak labels at scale for image classification. We

observed during the LTE-U OFF duration. It is relatively straightforward to
observe only the energy values during the LTE-U BS OFF time compared to
decoding the entire Wi-Fi packet, which would require a full Wi-Fi receiver at

for graph data. However, it is challenging for industrial communities to
leverage the techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), and solve
real-world problems at scale because of inherent data dependency in the graphs.
As such, we cannot simply train a GNN with classic learning systems, for
instance parameter server that assumes data parallel. Existing systems store
the graph data in-memory for fast accesses either in a single machine or graph
stores from remote. The major drawbacks are in three-fold. First, they cannot
scale because of the limitations on the volume of the memory, or the bandwidth
between graph stores and workers. Second, they require extra development of
graph stores without well exploiting mature infrastructures such as MapReduce
that guarantee good system properties. Third, they focus on training but ignore
the optimization of inference over graphs, thus makes them an unintegrated
system.

system, with fully-functional training and inference for GNNs. Our system
design follows the message passing scheme underlying the computations of GNNs.
We design to generate the $k$-hop neighborhood, an information-complete
subgraph for each node, as well as do the inference simply by merging values
from in-edge neighbors and propagating values to out-edge neighbors via
MapReduce. In addition, the $k$-hop neighborhood contains information-complete

threat to privacy. A growing body of prior work has demonstrated that
membership inference attack (MIA) can disclose specific private information in
the training data to an attacker. Meanwhile, the algorithmic fairness of
machine learning has increasingly caught attention from both academia and
industry. Algorithmic fairness ensures that the machine learning models do not
discriminate a particular demographic group of individuals (e.g., black and
female people). Given that MIA is indeed a learning model, it raises a serious
concern if MIA ``fairly'' treats all groups of individuals equally. In other
words, whether a particular group is more vulnerable against MIA than the other
groups. This paper examines the algorithmic fairness issue in the context of
MIA and its defenses. First, for fairness evaluation, it formalizes the
notation of vulnerability disparity (VD) to quantify the difference of MIA
treatment on different demographic groups. Second, it evaluates VD on four
real-world datasets, and shows that VD indeed exists in these datasets. Third,
it examines the impacts of differential privacy, as a defense mechanism of MIA,

cannot eliminate VD completely. Therefore, fourth, it designs a new mitigation

Moreover, the similarity of color also poses a challenge in segmentation. In

Concerning the reliability of surface texture, we leveraged the contour

inapplicable to clustered metal parts due to the difficulties in segmentation,
we use the dense discrete points along the metal part edges as semantic
keypoints for contour detection. Afterward, we exploit both keypoint
information and CAD model to calculate the 6D pose of each object in view. A

The original mean-variance framework is appealing because it is very efficient
from a computational point of view. However, it also has one well-established
failing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial
point of view. Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real
alternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact
that most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life
although they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that
they can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of
assets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable
to manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets. However, the emergence
and the rapid development of robo-advisors means that we need to rethink
portfolio optimization and go beyond the traditional mean-variance optimization
approach. Another industry has faced similar issues concerning large-scale
optimization problems. Machine learning has long been associated with linear
and logistic regression models. Again, the reason was the inability of
optimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems.
Nevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the
development and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced

the differences in architecture designs and implementations of existing

and platforms influence both DL software development and deployment in
practice. To fill this gap, we take the first step towards understanding how
the most widely-used DL frameworks and platforms support the DL software
development and deployment. We conduct a systematic study on these frameworks
and platforms by using two types of DNN architectures and three popular
datasets. (1) For development process, we investigate the prediction accuracy
under the same runtime training configuration or same model weights/biases. We
also study the adversarial robustness of trained models by leveraging the
existing adversarial attack techniques. The experimental results show that the
computing differences across frameworks could result in an obvious prediction
accuracy decline, which should draw the attention of DL developers. (2) For
deployment process, we investigate the prediction accuracy and performance
(refers to time cost and memory consumption) when the trained models are
migrated/quantized from PC to real mobile devices and web browsers. The DL
platform study unveils that the migration and quantization still suffer from
compatibility and reliability issues. Meanwhile, we find several DL software

Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller

recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs).
This paper also lays out a framework for extending this modeling approach to
intra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizon
forecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-day
solar irradiance. We develop an end-to-end pipeline to effectuate the proposed
architecture. The performance of the prediction model is tested and validated
by the methodical implementation. The robustness of the approach is
demonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sites
across the United States. The predictions demonstrate that our proposed unified
architecture-based approach is effective for multi-time-scale solar forecasts
and achieves a lower root-mean-square prediction error when benchmarked against
the best-performing methods documented in the literature that use separate
models for each time-scale during the day. Our proposed method results in a
71.5% reduction in the mean RMSE averaged across all the test sites compared to
the ML-based best-performing method reported in the literature. Additionally,
the proposed method enables multi-time-horizon forecasts with real-time inputs,
which have a significant potential for practical industry applications in the

  Lead Scoring Engine","Applied Data Scientists throughout various industries are commonly faced with
the challenging task of encoding high-cardinality categorical features into
digestible inputs for machine learning algorithms. This paper describes a
Bayesian encoding technique developed for WeWork's lead scoring engine which
outputs the probability of a person touring one of our office spaces based on
interaction, enrichment, and geospatial data. We present a paradigm for
ensemble modeling which mitigates the need to build complicated preprocessing
and encoding schemes for categorical variables. In particular, domain-specific
conjugate Bayesian models are employed as base learners for features in a
stacked ensemble model. For each column of a categorical feature matrix we fit
a problem-specific prior distribution, for example, the Beta distribution for a
binary classification problem. In order to analytically derive the moments of
the posterior distribution, we update the prior with the conjugate likelihood
of the corresponding target variable for each unique value of the given
categorical feature. This function of column and value encodes the categorical
feature matrix so that the final learner in the ensemble model ingests
low-dimensional numerical input. Experimental results on both curated and real
world datasets demonstrate impressive accuracy and computational efficiency on
a variety of problem archetypes. Particularly, for the lead scoring engine at
WeWork -- where some categorical features have as many as 300,000 levels -- we
have seen an AUC improvement from 0.87 to 0.97 through implementing conjugate

  Review","One type of machine learning, text classification, is now regularly applied
in the legal matters involving voluminous document populations because it can
reduce the time and expense associated with the review of those documents. One
form of machine learning - Active Learning - has drawn attention from the legal
community because it offers the potential to make the machine learning process
even more effective. Active Learning, applied to legal documents, is considered
a new technology in the legal domain and is continuously applied to all
documents in a legal matter until an insignificant number of relevant documents
are left for review. This implementation is slightly different than traditional
implementations of Active Learning where the process stops once achieving
acceptable model performance. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to
question whether Active Learning actually is a superior learning methodology
and (ii) to highlight the ways that Active Learning can be most effectively
applied to real legal industry data. Unlike other studies, our experiments were
performed against large data sets taken from recent, real-world legal matters
covering a variety of areas. We conclude that, although these experiments show
the Active Learning strategy popularly used in legal document review can
quickly identify informative training documents, it becomes less effective over
time. In particular, our findings suggest this most popular form of Active
Learning in the legal arena, where the highest-scoring documents are selected
as training examples, is in fact not the most efficient approach in most

tedious and highly time-consuming. Due to its importance, automating the
product description generation has attracted considerable interests from both
research and industrial communities. Existing methods mainly use templates or

out-performs the baseline on various metrics. KOBE can achieve an improvement

interactive learning delivers much better coding accuracy than standard
""non-interactive"" learning. This is especially true when the amount of data we

also for small-scale studies. Interactive learning also lends itself to reusing

  Active-Code Replacement","OODIDA (On-board/Off-board Distributed Data Analytics) is a platform for
distributed real-time analytics, targeting fleets of reference vehicles in the
automotive industry. Its users are data analysts. The bulk of the data
analytics tasks are performed by clients (on-board), while a central cloud
server performs supplementary tasks (off-board). OODIDA can be automatically
packaged and deployed, which necessitates restarting parts of the system, or
all of it. As this is potentially disruptive, we added the ability to execute
user-defined Python modules on clients as well as the server. These modules can
be replaced without restarting any part of the system; they can even be
replaced between iterations of an ongoing assignment. This feature is referred
to as active-code replacement. It facilitates use cases such as iterative A/B
testing of machine learning algorithms or modifying experimental algorithms
on-the-fly. Consistency of results is achieved by majority vote, which prevents
tainted state. Active-code replacement can be done in less than a second in an
idealized setting whereas a standard deployment takes many orders of magnitude
more time. The main contribution of this paper is the description of a
relatively straightforward approach to active-code replacement that is very
user-friendly. It enables a data analyst to quickly execute custom code on the

Unlike previous simulators that entirely rely on CG models and game engines,
our augmented simulator bypasses the requirement to create high-fidelity
background CAD models. Instead, we can simply deploy a vehicle with a LiDAR
scanner to sweep the street of interests to obtain the background point cloud,
based on which annotated point cloud can be automatically generated. This
unique ""scan-and-simulate"" capability makes our approach scalable and
practical, ready for large-scale industrial applications. In this paper, we
describe our simulator in detail, in particular the placement of obstacles that
is critical for performance enhancement. We show that detectors with our
simulated LiDAR point cloud alone can perform comparably (within two percentage
points) with these trained with real data. Mixing real and simulated data can

advantages compared with the traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
However, an NMT system still often produces translation failures due to the
complexity of natural language and sophistication in designing neural networks.
While in-house black-box system testing based on reference translations (i.e.,
examples of valid translations) has been a common practice for NMT quality
assurance, an increasingly critical industrial practice, named in-vivo testing,
exposes unseen types or instances of translation failures when real users are

language translation that can be checked systematically and uses information
from both the test inputs (i.e., the texts to be translated) and the test
outputs (i.e., the translations under inspection) of the NMT system. Our
evaluation conducted on real-world datasets shows that our approach can
effectively detect targeted property violations as translation failures. Our

  Display Advertising","Real-time bidding (RTB) is an important mechanism in online display

budget constrained bidding as a Markov Decision Process and propose a

misleading under a critical resource constraint. Therefore, we innovate a

both at an application's inception and in an evolutionary context as GUI
changes keep pace with evolving features. Unfortunately, this practice is
challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an approach that
automates this process by enabling accurate prototyping of GUIs via three

dynamic analysis, and deep convolutional neural networks are utilized to
accurately classify GUI-components into domain-specific types (e.g.,
toggle-button). Finally, a data-driven, K-nearest-neighbors algorithm generates
a suitable hierarchical GUI structure from which a prototype application can be
automatically assembled. We implemented this approach for Android in a system

Newer speed regulations will be enforced based on location of the Train with

requirement for data analytics systems. While almost all the ML tools require
the input data to be presented as a single table, many datasets are
multi-table, which forces data scientists to join those tables first, leading
to data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on ""factorized"" ML mitigate
this issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML through joins. But
their approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Such piecemeal
methods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas to
other ML algorithms. In this paper, we show that it is possible to mitigate
this overhead by leveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the
computations of many ML algorithms: linear algebra. We introduce a new logical
data type to represent normalized data and devise a framework of algebraic
rewrite rules to convert a large set of linear algebra operations over
denormalized data into operations over normalized data. We show how this
enables us to automatically ""factorize"" several popular ML algorithms, thus
unifying and generalizing several prior works. We prototype our framework in
the popular ML environment R and an industrial R-over-RDBMS tool. Experiments
with both synthetic and real normalized data show that our framework also
yields significant speed-ups, up to 36x on real data.",arxiv,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

  Accelerators in Xilinx and Altera FPGAs","Deep learning has significantly advanced the state of the art in artificial
intelligence, gaining wide popularity from both industry and academia. Special
interest is around Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which take inspiration
from the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex, to form deep layers of
convolutional operations, along with fully connected classifiers. Hardware
implementations of these deep CNN architectures are challenged with memory
bottlenecks that require many convolution and fully-connected layers demanding
large amount of communication for parallel computation. Multi-core CPU based
solutions have demonstrated their inadequacy for this problem due to the memory
wall and low parallelism. Many-core GPU architectures show superior performance
but they consume high power and also have memory constraints due to
inconsistencies between cache and main memory. FPGA design solutions are also
actively being explored, which allow implementing the memory hierarchy using
embedded BlockRAM. This boosts the parallel use of shared memory elements
between multiple processing units, avoiding data replicability and
inconsistencies. This makes FPGAs potentially powerful solutions for real-time
classification of CNNs. Both Altera and Xilinx have adopted OpenCL co-design
framework from GPU for FPGA designs as a pseudo-automatic development solution.

  real-time streak-detection system","Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the 1-100 meter size range are estimated to be
$\sim$1,000 times more numerous than the $\sim$15,000 currently-catalogued
NEAs, most of which are in the 0.5-10 kilometer size range. Impacts from 10-100
meter size NEAs are not statistically life-threatening but may cause
significant regional damage, while 1-10 meter size NEAs with low velocities
relative to Earth are compelling targets for space missions. We describe the
implementation and initial results of a real-time NEA-discovery system
specialized for the detection of small, high angular rate (visually-streaked)
NEAs in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images. PTF is a 1.2-m aperture,
7.3-deg$^2$ field-of-view optical survey designed primarily for the discovery
of extragalactic transients (e.g., supernovae) in 60-second exposures reaching
$\sim$20.5 visual magnitude. Our real-time NEA discovery pipeline uses a
machine-learned classifier to filter a large number of false-positive streak
detections, permitting a human scanner to efficiently and remotely identify
real asteroid streaks during the night. Upon recognition of a streaked NEA
detection (typically within an hour of the discovery exposure), the scanner
triggers follow-up with the same telescope and posts the observations to the
Minor Planet Center for worldwide confirmation. We describe our ten initial
confirmed discoveries, all small NEAs that passed 0.3-15 lunar distances from
Earth. Lastly, we derive useful scaling laws for comparing
streaked-NEA-detection capabilities of different surveys as a function of their
hardware and survey-pattern characteristics. This work most directly informs
estimates of the streak-detection capabilities of the Zwicky Transient Facility

Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and wearable devices, the need for a hand
based input mechanism is becoming essential in order to make the experience
natural, seamless and immersive. Hand pose estimation has progressed
drastically in recent years due to the introduction of commodity depth cameras.
  Hand pose estimation based on vision is still a challenging problem due to
its complexity from self-occlusion (between fingers), close similarity between
fingers, dexterity of the hands, speed of the pose and the high dimension of
the hand kinematic parameters. Articulated hand pose estimation is still an
open problem and under intensive research from both academia and industry.
  The 2 approaches used for hand pose estimation are: discriminative and
generative. Generative approach is a model based that tries to fit a hand model
to the observed data. Discriminative approach is appearance based, usually
implemented with machine learning (ML) and require a large amount of training
data. Recent hand pose estimation uses hybrid approach by combining both
discriminative and generative methods into a single hand pipeline.
  In this paper, we focus on reviewing recent progress of hand pose estimation
from depth sensor. We will survey discriminative methods, generative methods

Accurate prediction of NTLs for customers using machine learning is therefore

may change and mostly consider small data sets, often not allowing to deploy

Researchers developing such methodologies are often constrained on the number

their corresponding domain specific software components.
  This paper presents HyFlex, a software framework for the development of

interface for dealing with different combinatorial optimisation problems, and
provides the algorithm components that are problem specific. In this way, the
algorithm designer does not require a detailed knowledge the problem domains,
