  Markdown in Online Fashion E-commerce","Managing discount promotional events (""markdown"") is a significant part of
running an e-commerce business, and inefficiencies here can significantly
hamper a retailer's profitability. Traditional approaches for tackling this
problem rely heavily on price elasticity modelling. However, the partial
information nature of price elasticity modelling, together with the
non-negotiable responsibility for protecting profitability, mean that machine
learning practitioners must often go through great lengths to define strategies
for measuring offline model quality. In the face of this, many retailers fall
back on rule-based methods, thus forgoing significant gains in profitability
that can be captured by machine learning. In this paper, we introduce two novel
end-to-end markdown management systems for optimising markdown at different
stages of a retailer's journey. The first system, ""Ithax"", enacts a rational
supply-side pricing strategy without demand estimation, and can be usefully
deployed as a ""cold start"" solution to collect markdown data while maintaining
revenue control. The second system, ""Promotheus"", presents a full framework for
markdown optimization with price elasticity. We describe in detail the specific
modelling and validation procedures that, within our experience, have been
crucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both
markdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by
our experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements
of 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies. These
systems have been deployed to manage markdown at ASOS.com, and both systems can
be fruitfully deployed for price optimization across a wide variety of retail

  Perspective","Modern recommender systems aim to improve user experience. As reinforcement
learning (RL) naturally fits this objective -- maximizing an user's reward per
session -- it has become an emerging topic in recommender systems. Developing
RL-based recommendation methods, however, is not trivial due to the
\emph{offline training challenge}. Specifically, the keystone of traditional RL
is to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of
`errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannot
afford the price of making `errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to be
trained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under different
recommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimal
policies under these offline training settings.
  Here we propose a new learning paradigm -- namely Prompt-Based Reinforcement
Learning (PRL) -- for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents.
While traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs to
their expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e.,
recommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trained
to predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observed
reward value -- with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, this
historical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-reward
pairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question:
\emph{ Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions \& the
prompted reward value}? We implement PRL with four notable recommendation
models and conduct experiments on two real-world e-commerce datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
methods.",arxiv,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

in e-commerce marketplaces. Apart from rule-based and machine learning filters
that are already deployed in production, we want to enable efficient real-time
inference with graph neural networks (GNNs), which is useful to catch multihop
risk propagation in a transaction graph. However, two challenges arise in the
implementation of GNNs in production. First, future information in a dynamic
graph should not be considered in message passing to predict the past. Second,
the latency of graph query and GNN model inference is usually up to hundreds of
milliseconds, which is costly for some critical online services. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a Batch and Real-time Inception GrapH Topology
(BRIGHT) framework to conduct an end-to-end GNN learning that allows efficient
online real-time inference. BRIGHT framework consists of a graph transformation
module (Two-Stage Directed Graph) and a corresponding GNN architecture (Lambda
Neural Network). The Two-Stage Directed Graph guarantees that the information
passed through neighbors is only from the historical payment transactions. It
consists of two subgraphs representing historical relationships and real-time
links, respectively. The Lambda Neural Network decouples inference into two
stages: batch inference of entity embeddings and real-time inference of
transaction prediction. Our experiments show that BRIGHT outperforms the
baseline models by >2\% in average w.r.t.~precision. Furthermore, BRIGHT is
computationally efficient for real-time fraud detection. Regarding end-to-end

large-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item
arrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput. In this paper, we propose
a new task planning problem called TPRW, which aims to minimize the end-to-end

are ineffective to solve the TPRW problem because they fail to adapt to the

Adaptive Task Planning, a framework for large-scale robotized warehouses with

Betting exchanges act as online platforms on which bettors can find willing

human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and
viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g.,
viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral
diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into
hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by

different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned

pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has demonstrated its effectiveness in
incorporating relevance signals from external documents. However, the existing
studies are either based on heuristic rules or require heavy manual labeling.
In this work, we treat the PRF selection as a learning task and proposed a
reinforced learning based method that can be trained in an end-to-end manner
without any human annotations. More specifically, we proposed a reinforced
selector to extract useful PRF terms to enhance response candidates and a BERT
based response ranker to rank the PRF-enhanced responses. The performance of
the ranker serves as rewards to guide the selector to extract useful PRF terms,
and thus boost the task performance. Extensive experiments on both standard
benchmark and commercial datasets show the superiority of our reinforced PRF
term selector compared with other potential soft or hard selection methods.
Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analysis show that our model can
not only select meaningful PRF terms to expand response candidates but also
achieve the best results compared with all the baseline methods on a variety of

authentic performances, so as to motivate the faithful contributions of
well-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for model

great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion of

RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a

kinds of methods show that there is essentially a trade-off between feature
interpretability and search efficiency. To possess both of their merits, we
propose a novel method named Feature Interaction Via Edge Search (FIVES), which

with recommendations represent up to 30\% of total interactions. Moreover, in
practice, recommender system can greatly influence user behavior by promoting
specific items. In this paper, we extend the RNN modeling framework by taking
into account user interaction with recommended items. We propose and evaluate
RNN architectures that consist of the recommendation action module and the
state-action fusion module. Using real-world large-scale datasets we
demonstrate improved performance on the next item prediction task compared to
the baselines.",arxiv,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

  Crowdsourcing","In the past decade, tracking health trends using social media data has shown
great promise, due to a powerful combination of massive adoption of social
media around the world, and increasingly potent hardware and software that
enables us to work with these new big data streams. At the same time, many
challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch
between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are
updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained
on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work
is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even
though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple
evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities
are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus
little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we
introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends
by making use of continuous crowdsourced labelling of public social media
content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow
from data collection, filtering, labelling and training of machine learning
classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the
public health domain. This work introduces the technical aspects of the
platform and explores its future use cases.",arxiv,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

advertising. Sponsored search (SS) auction, due to the randomness of user query
behavior and platform nature, usually adopts keyword-level bidding strategies.
In contrast, the display advertising (DA), as a relatively simpler scenario for
auction, has taken advantage of real-time bidding (RTB) to boost the
performance for advertisers. In this paper, we consider the RTB problem in
sponsored search auction, named SS-RTB. SS-RTB has a much more complex dynamic
environment, due to stochastic user query behavior and more complex bidding
policies based on multiple keywords of an ad. Most previous methods for DA
cannot be applied. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) solution for
handling the complex dynamic environment. Although some RL methods have been
proposed for online advertising, they all fail to address the ""environment
changing"" problem: the state transition probabilities vary between two days.
Motivated by the observation that auction sequences of two days share similar
transition patterns at a proper aggregation level, we formulate a robust MDP
model at hour-aggregation level of the auction data and propose a
control-by-model framework for SS-RTB. Rather than generating bid prices
directly, we decide a bidding model for impressions of each hour and perform
real-time bidding accordingly. We also extend the method to handle the
multi-agent problem. We deployed the SS-RTB system in the e-commerce search
auction platform of Alibaba. Empirical experiments of offline evaluation and
online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",arxiv,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

  with Spark","The expansion of the electronic commerce, together with an increasing
confidence of customers in electronic payments, makes of fraud detection a
critical factor. Detecting frauds in (nearly) real time setting demands the
design and the implementation of scalable learning techniques able to ingest
and analyse massive amounts of streaming data. Recent advances in analytics and
the availability of open source solutions for Big Data storage and processing
open new perspectives to the fraud detection field. In this paper we present a
SCAlable Real-time Fraud Finder (SCARFF) which integrates Big Data tools
(Kafka, Spark and Cassandra) with a machine learning approach which deals with

objectives on a micro-crowdsourcing marketplace - the quality of work, total
cost incurred, and time to completion. Previous control agents have mostly
focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, but not on directly
controlling all three in concert. A naive formulation of three-objective
optimization is intractable; Octopus takes a hierarchical POMDP approach, with
three different components responsible for setting the pay per task, selecting
the next task, and controlling task-level quality. We demonstrate that Octopus
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on real
experiments. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing its
ability to manage tasks in a real-world dynamic setting.",arxiv,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
