  out-of-distribution generalization in medical images","Since data scarcity and data heterogeneity are prevailing for medical images,
well-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using previous normalization
methods may perform poorly when deployed to a new site. However, a reliable
model for real-world applications should be able to generalize well both on
in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data (e.g., the new site
data). In this study, we present a novel normalization technique called window
normalization (WIN), which is a simple yet effective alternative to existing
normalization methods. Specifically, WIN perturbs the normalizing statistics
with the local statistics computed on a window of features. This feature-level
augmentation technique regularizes the models well and improves their OOD
generalization significantly. Taking its advantage, we propose a novel
self-distillation method called WIN-WIN to further improve the OOD
generalization in classification. WIN-WIN is easily implemented with twice
forward passes and a consistency constraint, which can be a simple extension
for existing methods. Extensive experimental results on various tasks (such as
glaucoma detection, breast cancer detection, chromosome classification, optic
disc and cup segmentation, etc.) and datasets (26 datasets) demonstrate the
generality and effectiveness of our methods. The code is available at

often only exposed when models are evaluated on real-world data that does not
contain the same spurious correlations, posing a serious dilemma for AI
practitioners to properly assess the effectiveness of a trained model for
real-world applications. In this work, we propose to use the mutual information

used in our daily lives such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare systems, and
unmanned aircraft systems. Machine Learning is a field of AI that enables
systems to learn from data and make decisions on new data based on models to
achieve a given goal. The stochastic nature of AI models makes verification and
validation tasks challenging. Moreover, there are intrinsic biaises in AI
models such as reproductibility bias, selection bias (e.g., races, genders,
color), and reporting bias (i.e., results that do not reflect the reality).
Increasingly, there is also a particular attention to the ethical, legal, and
societal impacts of AI. AI systems are difficult to audit and certify because
of their black-box nature. They also appear to be vulnerable to threats; AI
systems can misbehave when untrusted data are given, making them insecure and
unsafe. Governments, national and international organizations have proposed
several principles to overcome these challenges but their applications in
practice are limited and there are different interpretations in the principles
that can bias implementations. In this paper, we examine trust in the context
of AI-based systems to understand what it means for an AI system to be
trustworthy and identify actions that need to be undertaken to ensure that AI
systems are trustworthy. To achieve this goal, we first review existing
approaches proposed for ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, in order to
identify potential conceptual gaps in understanding what trustworthy AI is.
Then, we suggest a trust (resp. zero-trust) model for AI and suggest a set of

  All You Need","Data diversity and volume are crucial to the success of training deep
learning models, while in the medical imaging field, the difficulty and cost of
data collection and annotation are especially huge. Specifically in robotic
surgery, data scarcity and imbalance have heavily affected the model accuracy
and limited the design and deployment of deep learning-based surgical
applications such as surgical instrument segmentation. Considering this, we
rethink the surgical instrument segmentation task and propose a one-to-many
data generation solution that gets rid of the complicated and expensive process
of data collection and annotation from robotic surgery. In our method, we only
utilize a single surgical background tissue image and a few open-source
instrument images as the seed images and apply multiple augmentations and
blending techniques to synthesize amounts of image variations. In addition, we
also introduce the chained augmentation mixing during training to further
enhance the data diversities. The proposed approach is evaluated on the real
datasets of the EndoVis-2018 and EndoVis-2017 surgical scene segmentation. Our
empirical analysis suggests that without the high cost of data collection and

Moreover, we also observe that our method can deal with novel instrument

Influenza seasons and submitted to the CDC for public communication. The
forecasting models range from mechanistic models, and auto-regression models to
machine learning models. We hypothesize that we can improve forecasting by
using multiple mechanistic models to produce potential trajectories and use
machine learning to learn how to combine those trajectories into an improved
forecast. We propose a Tree Ensemble model design that utilizes the individual
predictors of our baseline model SIkJalpha to improve its performance. Each
predictor is generated by changing a set of hyper-parameters. We compare our
prospective forecasts deployed for the FluSight challenge (2022) to all the

outperforms all other models in terms of the mean absolute error and the

  Super-Resolution from CT Scans","In clinical practice, anisotropic volumetric medical images with low
through-plane resolution are commonly used due to short acquisition time and
lower storage cost. Nevertheless, the coarse resolution may lead to
difficulties in medical diagnosis by either physicians or computer-aided
diagnosis algorithms. Deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution (SR)
methods are feasible ways to improve resolution, with convolutional neural
networks (CNN) at their core. Despite recent progress, these methods are
limited by inherent properties of convolution operators, which ignore content
relevance and cannot effectively model long-range dependencies. In addition,
most of the existing methods use pseudo-paired volumes for training and
evaluation, where pseudo low-resolution (LR) volumes are generated by a simple
degradation of their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the domain gap
between pseudo- and real-LR volumes leads to the poor performance of these
methods in practice. In this paper, we build the first public real-paired
dataset RPLHR-CT as a benchmark for volumetric SR, and provide baseline results
by re-implementing four state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. Considering the
inherent shortcoming of CNN, we also propose a transformer volumetric
super-resolution network (TVSRN) based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with
convolutions entirely. This is the first research to use a pure transformer for
CT volumetric SR. The experimental results show that TVSRN significantly

  Generalizability of Medical Image Segmentation","Although supervised deep-learning has achieved promising performance in
medical image segmentation, many methods cannot generalize well on unseen data,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this problem, we propose a

segmentation. Specifically, we first decompose an image into components of
contour and basis. Then, we model the expected label as a variable only related
to the contour. Finally, we develop a variational Bayesian framework to infer
the posterior distributions of these variables, including the contour, the
basis, and the label. The framework is implemented with neural networks, thus
is referred to as deep Bayesian segmentation. Results on the task of
cross-sequence cardiac MRI segmentation show that our method set a new state of
the art for model generalizability. Particularly, the BayeSeg model trained

existing automatic methods having been developed to identify imperfections and
artefacts in medical imaging, they mostly rely on data-hungry methods. In
particular, the lack of sufficient scans with artefacts available for training
has created a barrier in designing and deploying machine learning in clinical
research. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework having four main
components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance
physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of
abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature
selection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve
classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are
threefold: first, we use the novel physics-based artefact generators to
generate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts as a data
augmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and
labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool
of abstract and engineered image features developed to identify 9 different
artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature
selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features

neural networks into lightweight disjoint smaller components for pipelined
distributed processing. At present, there are two main approaches to do this:
semantic and layer-wise splitting. The former partitions a neural network into
parallel disjoint models that produce a part of the result, whereas the latter
partitions into sequential models that produce intermediate results. However,
there is no intelligent algorithm that decides which splitting strategy to use

  join efforts toward personalised medicine in a novel decision-making tool","Background and Objectives: Personalised medicine remains a major challenge
for scientists. The rapid growth of Machine learning and Deep learning has made
it a feasible alternative for predicting the most appropriate therapy for
individual patients. However, the lack of interpretation of their results and
high computational requirements make many reluctant to use these methods.
  Methods: Several Machine learning and Deep learning models have been
implemented into a single software tool, SIBILA. Once the models are trained,
SIBILA applies a range of interpretability methods to identify the input
features that each model considered the most important to predict. In addition,
all the features obtained are put in common to estimate the global attribution
of each variable to the predictions. To facilitate its use by non-experts,
SIBILA is also available to all users free of charge as a web server at
https://bio-hpc.ucam.edu/sibila/.
  Results: SIBILA has been applied to three case studies to show its accuracy
and efficiency in classification and regression problems. The first two cases
proved that SIBILA can make accurate predictions even on uncleaned datasets.
The last case demonstrates that SIBILA can be applied to medical contexts with
real data.
  Conclusion: With the aim of becoming a powerful decision-making tool for
clinicians, SIBILA has been developed. SIBILA is a novel software tool that
leverages interpretable machine learning to make accurate predictions and
explain how models made those decisions. SIBILA can be run on high-performance
computing platforms, drastically reducing computing times.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

indoor occupant's perception of indoor thermal comfort (TC) is subjective and

mitigation is hard, reinforcement learning provides a methodology to
automatically learn prevention strategies in combination with complex epidemic
models. Current research focuses on optimizing policies w.r.t. a single
objective, such as the pathogen's attack rate. However, as the mitigation of
epidemics involves distinct, and possibly conflicting criteria (i.a.,
prevalence, mortality, morbidity, cost), a multi-objective approach is
warranted to learn balanced policies. To lift this decision-making process to
real-world epidemic models, we apply deep multi-objective reinforcement
learning and build upon a state-of-the-art algorithm, Pareto Conditioned
Networks (PCN), to learn a set of solutions that approximates the Pareto front
of the decision problem. We consider the first wave of the Belgian COVID-19
epidemic, which was mitigated by a lockdown, and study different deconfinement
strategies, aiming to minimize both COVID-19 cases (i.e., infections and
hospitalizations) and the societal burden that is induced by the applied
mitigation measures. We contribute a multi-objective Markov decision process
that encapsulates the stochastic compartment model that was used to inform
policy makers during the COVID-19 epidemic. As these social mitigation measures
are implemented in a continuous action space that modulates the contact matrix
of the age-structured epidemic model, we extend PCN to this setting. We
evaluate the solution returned by PCN, and observe that it correctly learns to

sequence data and for predicting future events or outcomes based on such data.
However, a single neural sequential model may not properly represent complex

the models are still updated by back-propagation using an unsupervised loss on
complete test data distribution. In real-world clinical settings, it makes more
sense to adapt a model to a new test image on-the-fly and avoid model update
during inference due to privacy concerns and lack of computing resource at
deployment. To this end, we propose a new setting - On-the-Fly Adaptation which
is zero-shot and episodic (i.e., the model is adapted to a single image at a
time and also does not perform any back-propagation during test-time). To
achieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each
convolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to
adapt the features with respect to a domain code. The domain code is generated
using a pre-trained encoder trained on a large corpus of medical images. During
test-time, the model takes in just the new test image and generates a domain
code to adapt the features of source model according to the test data. We
validate the performance on both 2D and 3D data distribution shifts where we
get a better performance compared to previous test-time adaptation methods.

digital healthcare twins is model-based data synthesis, which permits the
generation of realistic medical signals without requiring to cope with the
modelling complexity of anatomical and biochemical phenomena producing them in
reality. Unfortunately, algorithms for cardiac data synthesis have been so far
scarcely studied in the literature. An important imaging modality in the
cardiac examination is three-directional CINE multi-slice myocardial velocity
mapping (3Dir MVM), which provides a quantitative assessment of cardiac motion
in three orthogonal directions of the left ventricle. The long acquisition time
and complex acquisition produce make it more urgent to produce synthetic
digital twins of this imaging modality. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep
learning (HDL) network, especially for synthetic 3Dir MVM data. Our algorithm
is featured by a hybrid UNet and a Generative Adversarial Network with a
foreground-background generation scheme. The experimental results show that
from temporally down-sampled magnitude CINE images (six times), our proposed
algorithm can still successfully synthesise high temporal resolution 3Dir MVM
CMR data (PSNR=42.32) with precise left ventricle segmentation (DICE=0.92).
These performance scores indicate that our proposed HDL algorithm can be
implemented in real-world digital twins for myocardial velocity mapping data
simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one in the

proper inferences. The sensitive and confidential nature of the data in such
sectors raises genuine concerns for data privacy. This motivated the area of
Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML), where privacy of data is
guaranteed. In this thesis, we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for
PPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) setting using Secure
Multi-party Computation (MPC) techniques.
  MPC, the holy-grail problem of secure distributed computing, enables a set of
n mutually distrusting parties to perform joint computation on their private
inputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information than
the output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation
(correctness). While MPC, in general, has been a subject of extensive research,
the area of MPC with a small number of parties has drawn popularity of late
mainly due to its application to real-time scenarios, efficiency and
simplicity. This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3
and 4 parties, with at most one corruption and supports ring structures.
  At the heart of this thesis are four frameworks - ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad,
ABY2.0 - catered to different settings. The practicality of our framework is
argued through improvements in the benchmarking of widely used ML algorithms --
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector
Machines. We propose two variants for each of our frameworks, with one variant
aiming to minimise the execution time while the other focuses on the monetary
cost. The concrete efficiency gains of our frameworks coupled with the stronger
security guarantee of robustness make our platform an ideal choice for a
real-time deployment of PPML techniques.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

sequence, so the last decades have been characterized by the implementation of
various point process into the field of social networks,electronic medical
records and financial transactions. At the beginning, Hawkes process and its
variants which can simulate simultaneously the self-triggering and mutual
triggering patterns between different events in complex sequences in a clear
and quantitative way are more popular.Later on, with the advances of neural
network, neural Hawkes process has been proposed one after another, and
gradually become a research hotspot. The proposal of the transformer Hawkes
process (THP) has gained a huge performance improvement, so a new upsurge of
the neural Hawkes process based on transformer is set off. However, THP does
not make full use of the information of occurrence time and type of event in
the asynchronous event sequence. It simply adds the encoding of event type
conversion and the location encoding of time conversion to the source encoding.
At the same time, the learner built from a single transformer will result in an
inescapable learning bias. In order to mitigate these problems, we propose a
tri-transformer Hawkes process (Tri-THP) model, in which the event and time
information are added to the dot-product attention as auxiliary information to
form a new multihead attention. The effectiveness of the Tri-THP is proved by a
series of well-designed experiments on both real world and synthetic data.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

in machine learning, specifically graph-structured data analysis, have the
potential to enable significant progress in improving the clinical trial
design. TrialGraph seeks to apply these methodologies to produce a

data to graph-structured formats. We then detail the mathematical basis and
implementation of a selection of graph machine learning algorithms, which
typically use standard machine classifiers on graph data embedded in a
low-dimensional feature space. We trained these models to predict side effect

medical conditions, and treatment. The MetaPath2Vec algorithm performed
exceptionally well, with standard Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random

ROC-AUC scores of 0.85, 0.68, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. Remarkably,
the best performing classifiers could only produce typical ROC-AUC scores of
0.70 when trained on equivalent array-structured data. Our work demonstrates
that graph modelling can significantly improve prediction accuracy on

applications, e.g., fraud detection in finance and healthcare monitoring. Due
to the inherently unpredictable and highly varied nature of anomalies and the
lack of anomaly labels in historical data, the AD problem is typically
formulated as an unsupervised learning problem. The performance of existing
solutions is often not satisfactory, especially in data-scarce scenarios. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised learning technique for
AD in time series, namely \emph{DeepFIB}. We model the problem as a \emph{Fill
In the Blank} game by masking some elements in the TS and imputing them with
the rest. Considering the two common anomaly shapes (point- or
sequence-outliers) in TS data, we implement two masking strategies with many
self-generated training samples. The corresponding self-imputation networks can
extract more robust temporal relations than existing AD solutions and
effectively facilitate identifying the two types of anomalies. For continuous
outliers, we also propose an anomaly localization algorithm that dramatically
reduces AD errors. Experiments on various real-world TS datasets demonstrate

  Scanning","Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging medical imaging modality

step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances

So-called split learning partially solves this problem by dividing a neural

classification, there lacks a principled approach to guide the label
combination for all data points by any optimality criterion. To address this

criterion that balances the trade-off between prediction accuracy (how well do
predicted labels agree with actual labels) and classification resolution (how
many labels are predictable), to guide practitioners on how to combine
ambiguous outcome labels. To find the optimal label combination indicated by
ITCA, we propose two search strategies: greedy search and breadth-first search.
Notably, ITCA and the two search strategies are adaptive to all
machine-learning classification algorithms. Coupled with a classification
algorithm and a search strategy, ITCA has two uses: improving prediction
accuracy and identifying ambiguous labels. We first verify that ITCA achieves

and vanishing gradients that occur in recurrent architectures. In addition, to
tackle the problem of limited availability of labeled data (which is typically

improved performance or generated comparable performance to conventional neural

a biological plausible approach with certain features such as topographic

the ability to represent high dimensional input space in lower dimensional

It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. We propose a hybrid

variable demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating
speeds are observed. Slowness, a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed
of steady distribution, is properly considered in MSFA for both heating pattern

available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have
large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this

a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for
COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel
attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve
the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation
results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature
extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination
module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction
learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding
pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain
information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels.
Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets
demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients about their behavioral
patterns. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of mental
health problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a
plethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep
neural networks (DNNs) points towards a possible solution. However, disease
diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, remains
a challenging problem. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep that
utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three
important mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and
bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors
integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data,
MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with
synthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the
synthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the
weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the
architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different
data partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from
74 individuals. We conduct data instance level and patient level evaluations.
MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of 90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%,

  Features","Fast diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax, a collapsed or dropped lung, is
crucial to avoid fatalities. Pneumothorax is typically detected on a chest
X-ray image through visual inspection by experienced radiologists. However, the
detection rate is quite low. Therefore, there is a strong need for automated
detection systems to assist radiologists. Despite the high accuracy levels
generally reported for deep learning classifiers in many applications, they may
not be useful in clinical practice due to the lack of large number of
high-quality labelled images as well as a lack of interpretation possibility.
Alternatively, searching in the archive of past cases to find matching images
may serve as a 'virtual second opinion' through accessing the metadata of
matched evidently diagnosed cases. To use image search as a triaging/diagnosis
tool, all chest X-ray images must first be tagged with identifiers, i.e., deep
features. Then, given a query chest X-ray image, the majority vote among the
top k retrieved images can provide a more explainable output. While image
search can be clinically more viable, its detection performance needs to be
investigated at a scale closer to real-world practice. We combined 3 public
datasets to assemble a repository with more than 550,000 chest X-ray images. We
developed the Autoencoding Thorax Net (short AutoThorax-Net) for image search

learning and data mining models. MF is commonly used to obtain item embeddings
and feature representations due to its ability to capture correlations and
higher-order statistical dependencies across dimensions. In many applications,
the categories of items exhibit a hierarchical tree structure. For instance,
human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and
viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g.,
viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral
diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into
hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by
type (formal, casual, etc.). While the tree structure and the categories of the
different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned
together with the embeddings in many others. In this work, we propose eTREE, a
model that incorporates the (usually ignored) tree structure to enhance the
quality of the embeddings. We leverage the special uniqueness properties of
Nonnegative MF (NMF) to prove identifiability of eTREE. The proposed model not

algorithmic solution and a scalable implementation of eTREE that exploits

margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square

little is known about DL's utility in non-invasive biometric monitoring during

that SSL will identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads from the raw
maternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG), containing fetal and maternal
ECG. Chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks
of gestation were studied. We validated the chronic stress exposure by
psychological inventory, maternal hair cortisol and FSI. We tested two variants
of SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotional
recognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a
subset of our data. Our DL models accurately detect the chronic stress exposure

continues to grow at a rapid pace, models are starting to be developed and
deployed for clinical applications. In the clinical AI model development
lifecycle (described by Lu et al. [1]), a crucial phase for machine learning
scientists and clinicians is the proper design and collection of the data
cohort. The ability to recognize various forms of biases and distribution
shifts in the dataset is critical at this step. While it remains difficult to
account for all potential sources of bias, techniques can be developed to
identify specific types of bias in order to mitigate their impact. In this work
we analyze how the distribution of scanner manufacturers in a dataset can
contribute to the overall bias of deep learning models. We evaluate
convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both classification and segmentation
tasks, specifically two state-of-the-art models: ResNet [2] for classification
and U-Net [3] for segmentation. We demonstrate that CNNs can learn to
distinguish the imaging scanner manufacturer and that this bias can
substantially impact model performance for both classification and segmentation
tasks. By creating an original synthesis dataset of brain data mimicking the
presence of more or less subtle lesions we also show that this bias is related
to the difficulty of the task. Recognition of such bias is critical to develop
robust, generalizable models that will be crucial for clinical applications in

labeling is expensive, for instance when specific expert knowledge is required.
Active Learning (AL) is one approach to mitigate the problem of limited labeled

and feature variables, and is important in application domains such as
medicine, marketing, risk management and sales management. Nonlinear tree based
machine learning algorithms as implemented in libraries such as XGBoost,
scikit-learn, LightGBM, and CatBoost are often more accurate in practice than
linear models. However, existing state-of-the-art implementations of tree-based
models have offered limited support for survival regression. In this work, we
implement loss functions for learning accelerated failure time (AFT) models in
XGBoost, to increase the support for survival modeling for different kinds of
label censoring. We demonstrate with real and simulated experiments the
effectiveness of AFT in XGBoost with respect to a number of baselines, in two
respects: generalization performance and training speed. Furthermore, we take
advantage of the support for NVIDIA GPUs in XGBoost to achieve substantial
speedup over multi-core CPUs. To our knowledge, our work is the first
implementation of AFT that utilizes the processing power of NVIDIA GPUs.
Starting from the 1.2.0 release, the XGBoost package natively supports the AFT
model. The addition of AFT in XGBoost has had significant impact in the open

  Optimization","Most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms assume online access to the

grow to be a serious problem. Despite numerous studies over the past few years,
the field of adversarial ML is still considered alchemy, with no practical
unbroken defenses demonstrated to date, leaving PHM practitioners with few
meaningful ways of addressing the problem. We introduce turbidity detection as
a practical superset of the adversarial input detection problem, coping with
adversarial campaigns rather than statistically invisible one-offs. This
perspective is coupled with ROC-theoretic design guidance that prescribes an
inexpensive domain adaptation layer at the output of a deep learning model
during an attack campaign. The result aims to approximate the Bayes optimal
mitigation that ameliorates the detection model's degraded health. A
proactively reactive type of prognostics is achieved via Monte Carlo simulation

transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain
under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain
model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to
professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature

the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical

Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable
machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be
considered when developing machine learning to support clinical
decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships
with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback
loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future
research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and

  haystack to the needle","The research literature on cybersecurity incident detection & response is
very rich in automatic detection methodologies, in particular those based on
the anomaly detection paradigm. However, very little attention has been devoted
to the diagnosis ability of the methods, aimed to provide useful information on
the causes of a given detected anomaly. This information is of utmost
importance for the security team to reduce the time from detection to response.
In this paper, we present Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA), a complete
intrusion detection approach based on 5 steps to effectively handle massive
amounts of disparate data sources. The approach has been designed to deal with
the main characteristics of Big Data, that is, the high volume, velocity and
variety. The core of the approach is the Multivariate Statistical Network
Monitoring (MSNM) technique proposed in a recent paper. Unlike in state of the
art machine learning methodologies applied to the intrusion detection problem,
when an anomaly is identified in MBDA the output of the system includes the
detail of the logs of raw information associated to this anomaly, so that the
security team can use this information to elucidate its root causes. MBDA is
based in two open software packages available in Github: the MEDA Toolbox and
the FCParser. We illustrate our approach with two case studies. The first one
demonstrates the application of MBDA to semistructured sources of information,
using the data from the VAST 2012 mini challenge 2. This complete case study is
supplied in a virtual machine available for download. In the second case study

although we have cast ordinal regression to classification, our method still

real-world applications. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a machine learning
technique that is effective in classification tasks. However, conventional DBN
does not work well for imbalanced data classification because it assumes equal
costs for each class. To deal with this problem, cost-sensitive approaches
assign different misclassification costs for different classes without
disrupting the true data sample distributions. However, due to lack of prior
knowledge, the misclassification costs are usually unknown and hard to choose
in practice. Moreover, it has not been well studied as to how cost-sensitive
learning could improve DBN performance on imbalanced data problems. This paper
proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive deep belief network (ECS-DBN) for
imbalanced classification. ECS-DBN uses adaptive differential evolution to
optimize the misclassification costs based on training data, that presents an
effective approach to incorporating the evaluation measure (i.e. G-mean) into
the objective function. We first optimize the misclassification costs, then
apply them to deep belief network. Adaptive differential evolution optimization
is implemented as the optimization algorithm that automatically updates its
corresponding parameters without the need of prior domain knowledge. The
experiments have shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art on both benchmark datasets and real-world dataset for fault
diagnosis in tool condition monitoring.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

other factors such as usability, efficiency and security of AI have not been

many real world applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving,
learning via huge amounts of possibility exploration is not feasible since
humans are involved. In many complex applications such as healthcare, subject

select individualized interventions to address their interest in tobacco use.
We searched the Twitter feed for tobacco-related keywords and phrases, and
trained a convolutional neural network using over 4,000 tweets dichotomously
manually labeled as either pro- tobacco or not pro-tobacco. This model achieves
a 90% recall rate on the training set and 74% on test data. Users posting pro-
tobacco tweets are matched with former smokers with similar interests who
posted anti-tobacco tweets. Algorithmic matching, based on the power of peer
influence, allows for the systematic delivery of personalized interventions
based on real anti-tobacco tweets from former smokers. Experimental evaluation

actions of RL policies could make the policies fail on real-world systems.
  We design a simulator for solving a pivoting task (of interest in Robotics)

performed using a simulator with a simple dynamics and noise model. Hence, we
demonstrate that as long as the main sources of uncertainty are identified, it
could be possible to learn policies applicable to real systems even using a
simple simulator.
  RL-compatible simulators could open the possibilities for applying a wide
range of RL algorithms in various fields. This is important, since currently
data sparsity in fields like healthcare and education frequently forces
researchers and engineers to only consider sample-efficient RL approaches.
Successful simulator-aided RL could increase flexibility of experimenting with
RL algorithms and help applying RL policies to real-world settings in fields
where data is scarce. We believe that lessons learned in Robotics could help
other fields design RL-compatible simulators, so we summarize our experience
and conclude with suggestions.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

opportunity to conduct cohort studies of the effects of multiple time-point
interventions in the diverse patient population found in real-world clinical
settings. Because the computational cost of analyzing EHR data at daily (or
more granular) scale can be quite high, a pragmatic approach has been to
partition the follow-up into coarser intervals of pre-specified length. Current
guidelines suggest employing a 'small' interval, but the feasibility and
practical impact of this recommendation has not been evaluated and no formal
methodology to inform this choice has been developed. We start filling these
gaps by leveraging large-scale EHR data from a diabetes study to develop and
illustrate a fast and scalable targeted learning approach that allows to follow
the current recommendation and study its practical impact on inference. More
specifically, we map daily EHR data into four analytic datasets using 90, 30,
15 and 5-day intervals. We apply a semi-parametric and doubly robust estimation
approach, the longitudinal TMLE, to estimate the causal effects of four dynamic
treatment rules with each dataset, and compare the resulting inferences. To
overcome the computational challenges presented by the size of these data, we
propose a novel TMLE implementation, the 'long-format TMLE', and rely on the
latest advances in scalable data-adaptive machine-learning software, xgboost
and h2o, for estimation of the TMLE nuisance parameters.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

models, practical inference approximations are needed. Dropout variational
inference (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical
applications, but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty.
Alpha-divergences are alternative divergences to VI's KL objective, which are
able to avoid VI's uncertainty underestimation. But these are hard to use in
practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating
distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of
limited use for practitioners. We propose a re-parametrisation of the
alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which,
together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply
changing the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates
and accuracy compared to VI in dropout networks. We study our model's epistemic
uncertainty far away from the data using adversarial images, showing that these
can be distinguished from non-adversarial images by examining our model's
uncertainty.",arxiv,health,'health' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

human-computer interfaces and automation systems. Most recent research has
focused on activity recognition, but little has been done on sensor-based
detection of process progress. We introduce a real-time, sensor-based system
for modeling, recognizing and estimating the progress of a work process. We
implemented a multimodal deep learning structure to extract the relevant
spatio-temporal features from multiple sensory inputs and used a novel deep
regression structure for overall completeness estimation. Using process
completeness estimation with a Gaussian mixture model, our system can predict
the phase for sequential processes. The performance speed, calculated using
completeness estimation, allows online estimation of the remaining time. To
train our system, we introduced a novel rectified hyperbolic tangent (rtanh)
activation function and conditional loss. Our system was tested on data
obtained from the medical process (trauma resuscitation) and sports events
(Olympic swimming competition). Our system outperformed the existing
trauma-resuscitation phase detectors with a phase detection accuracy of over
86%, an F1-score of 0.67, a completeness estimation error of under 12.6%, and a
remaining-time estimation error of less than 7.5 minutes. For the Olympic
swimming dataset, our system achieved an accuracy of 88%, an F1-score of 0.58,

effectively using machine learning methods requires considerable domain
expertise, which can be a barrier of entry for bioinformaticians new to
computational data science methods. Therefore, off-the-shelf tools that make
machine learning more accessible can prove invaluable for bioinformaticians. To
this end, we have developed an open source pipeline optimization tool
(TPOT-MDR) that uses genetic programming to automatically design machine
learning pipelines for bioinformatics studies. In TPOT-MDR, we implement
Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) as a feature construction method for
modeling higher-order feature interactions, and combine it with a new expert
knowledge-guided feature selector for large biomedical data sets. We
demonstrate TPOT-MDR's capabilities using a combination of simulated and real
world data sets from human genetics and find that TPOT-MDR significantly
outperforms modern machine learning methods such as logistic regression and
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We further analyze the best pipeline

become pivotal to use parallelization as a mechanism for speeding up network

Much research attention has been attracted to develop better SSI risk
prediction models. However, most of the existing SSI risk prediction models are
built on static risk factors such as comorbidities and operative factors. In
this paper, we investigate the use of the dynamic wound data for SSI risk
prediction. There have been emerging mobile health (mHealth) tools that can
closely monitor the patients and generate continuous measurements of many
wound-related variables and other evolving clinical variables. Since existing
prediction models of SSI have quite limited capacity to utilize the evolving
clinical data, we develop the corresponding solution to equip these mHealth
tools with decision-making capabilities for SSI prediction with a seamless
assembly of several machine learning models to tackle the analytic challenges
arising from the spatial-temporal data. The basic idea is to exploit the
low-rank property of the spatial-temporal data via the bilinear formulation,
and further enhance it with automatic missing data imputation by the matrix
completion technique. We derive efficient optimization algorithms to implement
these models and demonstrate the superior performances of our new predictive
model on a real-world dataset of SSI, compared to a range of state-of-the-art

to medical investigators. However, to protect patients' privacy, Protected
Health Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can
be legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. The
main objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible
recall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system has
been proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does
not rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,
but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health

human-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a
neural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that the
addition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the
state-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the
most sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting
