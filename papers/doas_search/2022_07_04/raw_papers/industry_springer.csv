In the case of punching machine, it is important to monitor the surface of the punch tool in order to detect abnormal incipient deformations. This paper addresses the problem of model building when only few punch-tool samples are available for model training. To this end, sample data are augmented by generating synthetic deformations and then using, hybridlike, both synthetic and real data for model training. The feature extraction process relies on the new concept of Profile Integration Matrix, which accounts for punch-tool surface deformations. Using the Profile Integration features, the predictive model is based on the supervised classifier one-class Support Vector Machine. The achieved results are promising, showing accuracy rates of 97.4% with hybrid data and of 97.7% with synthetic data.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-08136-1_37,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Attention is primarily paid to smart factories and questions linked with the development of artificial intelligence. The main objective of the study is to describe the basic attributes of Industry 4.0 and typical development trends linked with the fourth industrial revolution. Partial objectives of the study include putting Industry 4.0 into a wider historical context and mapping security risks that modern information and digital technologies bring about. The study consists of four relatively independent parts in which various aspects of the researched topic are described and analysed from complementary points of view. The first part of the study applies an anthropological approach that allows the analysis of developmental changes in different types of manufacturing to make use of the terms “culture” and “sociocultural change.” The second part of the study maps the history of humanity from a historic perspective together with transformations of manufacturing technologies during the first, second, and third industrial revolution with emphasis on the use of energy resources. The third part of the study, discussing the fourth industrial revolution, presents basic visions of Industry 4.0 including its main aspiration, i.e. connecting the Internet of Things, Services, and People.

It is beneficial in the conception of a design. A model is produced and evaluated on a regular basis prior to the start of complete assembly. Historically, manual prototyping was employed to create a prototype. Additive manufacturing is a buzzword in the industrial and manufacturing industries. Initially, the CAD model of the components for the product was created in modeling software according to the specifications. Following the creation of a CAD model, the model is sliced by parallel planes equal to the layer thickness. As a result, the edges of these slices are quite sharp and squared, like a stair effect. These three-dimensional models will now be broken into small two-dimensional objects called slices. Simply said, a complicated three-dimensional problem has been reduced to a set of two-dimensional difficulties. These small two-dimensional files are known as STL files, and they are sent by tessellating the geometric three-dimensional model. Different surfaces of a CAD model are piecewise approximated by a sequence of triangles in tessellation, and the coordinates of triangle vertices and their surface normal are recorded. The predictive nature of various machine learning algorithms makes them the best instrument for dealing with additive manufacturing challenges. Machine learning techniques are capable of evaluating previous data and predicting future outcomes based on that analysis. This article discusses machine learning applications in additive engineering.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-19-0108-9_32,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In order to improve the Ti–6Al–4V SLM-fabricated part quality and help the manufacturing engineers choose optimal process parameters, an optimization methodology based on an artificial neural network was developed to relate four key process parameters (laser power, laser scanning speed, layer thickness, and hatch distance) and two target properties of a part fabricated by the SLM technique (density ratio and surface roughness). A supervised learning deep neural network based on the backpropagation algorithm was applied to optimize input parameters for a given set of quality part outputs. Several methods were utilized to solve undesired problems occurring during neural network training to increase the model accuracy. The model’s performance was proven with a value of R^2 of 99% for both density ratio and surface roughness. A selection system was then built, allowing users to choose the optimal process parameters for fabricated products whose properties meet a specific user requirement. Experiments performed with the optimal process parameters recommended by the optimization system strongly confirmed its reliability by providing the ultimate part qualities nearly identical to those defined by the user with only about 0.9–4.4% of errors at the maximum.

Due to the complex relationships often inherent in those processes, the success of such methods is often uncertain and unreliable. Therefore, understanding the (algorithmic) behavior and results of machine learning methods is crucial to improve the prediction of production processes. Here, mathematical tools may help. This paper shows how efficient algorithms for the training of neural networks and their retraining in the framework of transfer learning are expressed in a discrete as well as a time-continuous formulation. The latter can be analyzed and investigated using mathematical techniques from kinetic gas dynamics. The results obtained provide a first step towards explainable artificial intelligence. Based on the mathematical description, an adapted ensemble method for retraining of neural networks is proposed and compared with backpropagation algorithms.

However, due to its process complexity, layer-wise surface quality issue is still one of the critical concerns to further broaden adoption of metal AM, because of the impact on products’ property and functionality. The existing experimental studies from literature have shown machine parameters could significantly affect the resulting surface morphology of printing products. Consequently, it is urgently necessary to analyze and model printing surface in metal AM, and thereby printing surface can be further correlated with machine parameters, enabling more appropriate quality assurance applications such as process design and post anomaly detection. However, there are two major practical challenges to realize this goal: (1)  the printing surface profiles in metal AM are highly nonlinear; and (2) the measured surface profiles usually have significant outliers, shifts, and porosities. To address these two challenges, this paper models surface profile in a decomposition-based framework and develops a hybrid data-driven feature extraction approach, which integrates a robust convolutional autoencoder-based approach and conventional statistics-based approach. Through the incorporation of supervised machine learning algorithm, the underlying relationship between machine parameters and printing surface can be thereby clearly quantified. To validate effectiveness of the proposed method, both simulation and a real-world case study in laser-engineered net shaping (LENS) were conducted in this work. The results demonstrate that the classification accuracy using the proposed method could achieve 86% in simulation cases and 74% in an actual LENS experiment, which outperforms the benchmark methods with better robustness. Therefore, it demonstrates that the developed approach is very promising for surface morphology analysis and process optimization of metal AM.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-022-09608-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To overcome these challenges, we present two-dimensional images of chemical structures as molecular representations.

A main application of ML is the construction of quality prediction models, which can be used, among other things, for documentation purposes, as assistance systems for process operators, or for adaptive process control. The quality of such ML models typically strongly depends on the amount and the quality of data used for training. In manufacturing, the size of available datasets before start of production (SOP) is often limited. In contrast to data, expert knowledge commonly is available in manufacturing. Therefore, this study introduces a general methodology for building quality prediction models with ML methods on small datasets by integrating shape expert knowledge, that is, prior knowledge about the shape of the input–output relationship to be learned. The proposed methodology is applied to a brushing process with 125 data points for predicting the surface roughness as a function of five process variables. As opposed to conventional ML methods for small datasets, the proposed methodology produces prediction models that strictly comply with all the expert knowledge specified by the involved process specialists. In particular, the direct involvement of process experts in the training of the models leads to a very clear interpretation and, by extension, to a high acceptance of the models. While working out the shape knowledge requires some iterations in general, another clear merit of the proposed methodology is that, in contrast to most conventional ML, it involves no time-consuming and often heuristic hyperparameter tuning or model selection step.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-022-01975-4,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, following the trend of the 4th Industrial Revolution, manufacturing systems have also increased the connectivity of various domains and the convergence of numerous technologies. These systems are referred to as smart manufacturing systems. However, this trend has increased the challenge of network anomaly detection methods, which are a major approach to network security in smart manufacturing. Existing methods define normality under the premise that network components are static, and network operation is periodic compared to the information technology environment. Therefore, comprehensive and volatile network environments require significant time, cost, and labor to define normality. Consequently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based anomaly detection studies have been actively conducted to solve this problem. However, such studies require manual analysis based on expert knowledge of each site during the preprocessing stage to extract the learning features from the collected network data. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a protocol reverse engineering method corresponding to the preprocessing stage of exiting AI studies. Through this method, existing AI-based anomaly detection studies can directly use the collected network data to learn normality without expert knowledge of the site. Furthermore, non-polling or reporting network operating environments that are rarely studied in the manufacturing security domain are targeted. Finally, we propose an anomaly detection method that uses an external signature, time information, the pattern of time intervals, and classified messages.

One of the difficulties in detecting the state of milling tools is that they are visually inspected, and due to this, the milling process needs to be interrupted. Intelligent monitoring systems based on accelerometers and algorithms have been developed as a part of Industry 4.0 to monitor the tool wear during milling process. In this paper, acoustic emission (AE) and vibration signals captured through sensors are analyzed and the scalograms were constructed from Morlet wavelets. The relative wavelet energy (RWE) criterion was applied to select suitable wavelet functions. Due to the availability of less experimental data to train the LSTM model for the prediction of tool wear, SinGAN was applied to generate additional scalograms and later several image quality parameters were extracted to construct feature vectors. The feature vector is used to train three long short-term memory network (LSTM) models: vanilla, stacked, and bidirectional. To analyze the performance of LSTM models for tool wear prediction, five performance parameters were computed namely R ^2, adjusted R ^2, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE). The lowest MAE, RMSE, and MSE values were observed as 0.005, 0.016, and 0.0002 and high R ^2 and Adj. R ^2 values as 0.997 are observed from the vibration signal. Results suggest that the stacked LSTM model predicts the tool wear better as compared to other LSTM models. The proposed methodology has given very less errors in tool wear predictions and can be extremely useful for the development of an online deep learning tool condition monitoring system.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-022-09356-0,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A deep learning-based multi-modality convolutional neural network (m-CNN) is trained to take the molten pool image and thermal profile as the input to comprehensively estimate the geometric properties of the build bead.

The effect of using the temperature data from the leading, center, and tailing positions of the molten pool on the prediction performance of the CNN model is studied and analyzed.

The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area.

Furthermore, to promote the accuracy of ML models for achieving high as-built density, this work employed a practical approach of feature dimension ascending to obtain twenty-two input variables based on SLM process parameters for a Bayesian network (BN) prediction model. A random forest (RF) algorithm was introduced to the feature screening from the high-dimensional features. The dimension-ascended features for the BN model replaced the source features corresponding to straightforward SLM process parameters such as laser power, laser scan speed, powder layer thickness, and melt hatch spacing. Following feature standardisation, the nonlinear combinations of augmented higher-ordered features contributed to training the BN model for predicting the relative densities of as-built parts using the known process parameters. Three regression evaluation indexes were employed to evaluate the BN models. The verification results declared that the BN model achieved a high prediction accuracy of as-built relative densities based on feature-dimension ascending. The significance of this work lies in that the manual setting of SLM process parameters can obtain a high-credible as-built density.

These droplet characteristics, in turn, determine the functional quality of the printed parts. Hence, to ensure repeatable and reliable part quality it is necessary to monitor and control the droplet characteristics. Existing approaches for in-situ monitoring of droplet behavior in DoD-LMJ rely on high-speed imaging sensors. The resulting high volume of droplet images acquired is computationally demanding to analyze and hinders real-time control of the process. To overcome this challenge, the objective of this work is to use time series data acquired from an in-process millimeter-wave sensor for predicting the size, velocity, and shape characteristics of droplets in DoD-LMJ process. As opposed to high-speed imaging, this sensor produces data-efficient time series signatures that allows rapid, real-time process monitoring. We devise machine learning models that use the millimeter-wave sensor data to predict the droplet characteristics. Specifically, we developed multilayer perceptron-based non-linear autoregressive models to predict the size and velocity of droplets. Likewise, a supervised machine learning model was trained to classify the droplet shape using the frequency spectrum information contained in the millimeter-wave sensor signatures. High-speed imaging data served as ground truth for model training and validation. These models captured the droplet characteristics with a statistical fidelity exceeding 90%, and vastly outperformed conventional statistical modeling approaches.

Existing point cloud completion networks, such as the Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of point cloud completion without considering the efficiency of the inference process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving accurately and efficiently. In the proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm that combines incremental sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improve the inference speed of the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and autonomous driving scenes are created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5 different sizes are used for three autonomous driving situations. The improved PF-Net can achieve speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10723-022-09610-5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In Industry 4.0, rapid advancements in Digital Twin (DT) technologies and the pervasiveness of cost-effective sensor technologies have pushed the incorporation of artificial intelligence, particularly data-driven machine learning models, for use in smart manufacturing. However, the persistent issue with such models is their high sensitivity to the training data and the lack of interpretability in the outcomes, at times generating unrealistic results. The incorporation of knowledge into the machine learning pipeline has been earmarked as the most promising approach to address such issues. This paper aims to answer this call through a Knowledge-embedded Machine Learning (KML) framework for smart manufacturing, which embeds knowledge from experience and, or physics information into the machine learning pipeline, thus making the outcomes from these models more representative of real applications. The merits of KML were then presented through comparative studies showing its capability to outperform knowledge-based and data-driven models. This promising outcome led to the development of frameworks that can potentially incorporate KML for smart manufacturing applications such as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and DT, further supporting the usefulness of the proposed KML framework.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-022-01973-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As a part family-oriented manufacturing system paradigm, D-RMS should concern delayed reconfiguration at the outset of part family formation. To bring the characteristics of delayed reconfiguration into the part family of D-RMS, an exclusive part family formation method for D-RMS based on machine learning is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a similarity coefficient that considers the characteristics of D-RMS is put forward based on the operation sequence of part. The positions of the common operations in the corresponding operation sequences are investigated. The more former common operations there are, the more probability it is that the parts are grouped into the same part family. The relative positions of the common operations are considered by proposing a concept of the longest relative position common operation subsequence (LPCS). Additionally, the position difference and discontinuity of the LPCSs in the corresponding operation sequences are analyzed. A similarity coefficient is proposed that incorporates the abovementioned factors. Secondly, a machine learning method named K-medoids is adopted to group parts into families based on the calculation result of the similarity coefficient. Finally, a case study is presented to implement the proposed part family formation method for D-RMS, where the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through comparison.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-022-01956-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They perform burn-in tests on each unit of product before shipment to ensure a high standard of quality. Burn-in is normally associated with high production costs and slows down manufacturing operations. This study aims to enhance the manufacturing process by predicting test failure patterns using machine learning methods. By identifying the components that are likely to cause failures, manufacturers can accelerate the rectification process and improve delivery time which in turn leads to better customer service. This study hypothesized that the component of concern produces a higher test failure rate. To provide insight into the data and test the hypothesis, descriptive and predictive analytics are used at various stages. Predictive analytics was performed using machine learning via Naïve Bayes since it outperformed SVM and Random Forest classifier. For the descriptive analysis stage, a visual representation revealed many components (81) to be associated with a more than average test failure rate. Fisher’s exact test confirmed that 12 of them are statistically significant and worth studying their behaviour further. Moreover, an association rule mining exercise identified several combinations of modules that have a higher inclination with the test failure. For the predictive analytics stage, the Naïve Bayes classifier predicted test failure with 79% accuracy and 53% recall rate. Another Naïve Bayes classifier predicted error messages associated with a test failure with 68% recall rate over manually labelled error messages. However, a neural network-based automatic text classifier was developed and tested that yielded 66% accuracy. This analysis provides the foundation for a recommendation made that can reduce the burn test failure rate by 25% which is expected to increase further with the improved performance model upon training with a larger data set.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-022-07465-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Surface electromyography (sEMG) devices are recommended to capture human hand gestures. However, this kind of technology raises significant challenges. sEMG signals are difficult to acquire and isolate reliably. The creation of a gesture representative model is hard due to the non-explicit nature of sEMG signals. Several solutions have been proposed for the recognition of sEMG-based hand gestures, but none of them are entirely satisfactory. This study contributes to take a step forward in finding the solution to this problem. A sEMG capturing prototype device was used to collect human hand gestures and a two-step algorithm is proposed to recognize five valid gestures, invalid gestures and non-gestures. The former algorithm step (segmentation) is used for sEMG signal isolation to separate signals containing gestures from signals containing non-gestures. The latter step of the algorithm (recognition) is based on a deep learning method, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that identifies which gesture is in the sEMG signals. The performances of the prototype device and recognition architecture were compared successfully with the off-the-shelf sEMG device Myo. Results indicated that the segmentation process played an important role in the success of the gesture recognition system, excluding sEMG signals containing non-gestures. The proposed system was applied successfully in the control loop of a collaborative robotic application, in which the gesture recognition system achieved an online class recognition rate (CR) of 98%, outperforming similar studies in the literature.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10846-022-01666-5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Several studies have previously reviewed AR-based maintenance across all industrial sectors, whereas those specific to manufacturing did not necessarily involve maintenance. Hence, this paper presents a systematic literature review on AR-assisted maintenance in manufacturing with a focus on the operator’s needs. A generic process has been proposed to classify the maintenance operations examined in the past studies into four sequential steps and to analyze the classification results based on the geographical location, maintenance type, AR technical elements, and integrated external sensors. The findings thus derived are expected to provide design guidelines for implementing AR applications with practical values to aid manual maintenance in future smart manufacturing environments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40684-022-00444-w,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the most frequent procedures for purifying petroleum products from unwanted sulfur species and reducing SO_2 emissions is the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. However, HDS is still challenging since a variety of factors influence sulfur removal rates, including operating circumstances, feed compositions, catalyst activity, and so on. In actuality, reducing sulfur compounds comes at a high price, both environmentally and economically. In practice, it is necessary to forecast process yields and their implications for productivity, profitability, and environmental considerations. The study of such outcomes could serve as guidance for scholars and practitioners alike. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have proven to be effective in solving various real-world problems in engineering and industrial fields, including the petroleum industry. This study presents a four-input support vector regression (SVR) model hybridized with a Bayesian optimization to predict three yields of the HDS process including outlet sulfur concentration, percentage of SO_2 emission, and percentage of biphenyl. The proposed models are used to identify the best laboratory configuration for better optimization of the HDS process. The obtained modeling results reveal that the proposed models are competent with a high degree of accuracy.

However, the geometrical transfer of joint kinematic errors and the relatively weak rigidity of industrial robots compared with frame movement systems decrease their absolute kinematic accuracy, thereby limiting their further application in ultra-precision manufacturing. This imposes a stringent requirement for improving the absolute kinematic accuracy of industrial robots in terms of the position and orientation of the robot arm end. Current measurement and compensation methods for industrial robots either require expensive measuring systems, producing positioning or orientation errors, or offer low measurement accuracy. Herein, a kinematic calibration method for an industrial robot using an artifact with a hybrid spherical and ellipsoid surface is proposed. A system with submicrometric precision for measuring the position and orientation of the robot arm end is developed using laser displacement sensors. Subsequently, a novel kinematic error compensating method involving both a residual learning algorithm and a neural network is proposed to compensate for nonlinear errors. A six-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to compensate for the kinematic nonlinear errors of a six-DOF industrial robot. The results validate the feasibility of the proposed method for measuring the kinematic errors of industrial robots, and the compensation method based on the RNN improves the accuracy via parameter fitting. Experimental studies show that the measuring system and compensation method can reduce motion errors by more than 30%. The present study provides a feasible and economic approach for measuring and improving the motion accuracy of an industrial robot at the submicrometric measurement level.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40436-022-00400-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (henceforth referenced as FDD) plays a key role on maintenance, since it allows for shorter maintenance times and, in the long run, to train predictive maintenance algorithms. The impact of proper maintenance is reflected on an especially costly type of industrial machine: gas turbines. These devices are complex, large pieces of machinery that cause considerable service disruption when downtime occurs. In an effort to shorten these service disruptions and establish the basis for the development of predictive maintenance, we present in this paper an approach to FDD of industrial machinery, such as gas turbines. Our approach exploits the data generated by industrial machinery to train a machine-learning based architecture, combining several algorithms with autoencoders and sliding windows. Our proposed solution helps to achieve early malfunctioning detection and has been tested using real data from real working environments. In order to build our solution, first, we analyze the behavior of the gas turbine from a mathematical point of view. Then, we develop an architecture that is capable of detecting when the gas turbine presents an abnormal behavior. The great advantage of our proposal is that (i) does not require existing disruption data, which can be difficult to obtain, (ii) is not limited to processes with specific time windows, and (iii) provides crucial information in real time to the monitoring staff, generating valuable data for further predictive maintenance. It is worth highlighting that although we exemplify our approach using gas turbines, our approach can be tailored to other FDD problems in complex industrial processes with variable duration that could benefit from the aforementioned advantages.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s13042-022-01583-x,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Missing values commonly appear in industrial datasets due to several reasons. In particular, unexpected changes in the process, failure of the sensors that are recording the measurements due to network connectivity or hardware issues, censored/anonymous features and human error are some of the reasons for missing values in these datasets. In the manufacturing context, it is expensive and time consuming to collect all the different types of data related to a part leading to siloed and incomplete datasets. Due to characteristics such as presence of high missingness ratios, varying patterns of missingness, class imbalance and small-sized datasets, approaches such as single imputation or dropping the rows with missing values as is done in complete case analysis would result in loss of information and can also introduce a bias in the analysis depending on the underlying mechanism of missingness. The approach used for treatment of missing values must be carefully chosen based on the characteristics of the data at hand as the downstream generalization performance of algorithms trained on the imputed data would directly depend on the quality of imputation. In this work, we present a novel approach to treating missing values in a real-world dataset. Our approach uses deep Hadamard autoencoders (HAE) in addition to the self-supervised learning paradigm and shows better imputation performance on the unobserved entries of the test set as compared to approaches such as single imputation using mean, or other methods such as standard autoencoders (SAE).

Image-based porosity detection represents a solution that can be easily implemented into existing systems at a low cost. However, current industry porosity detection software utilizes threshold-based methods which require user calibration and ideal lighting conditions, and thus cannot be fully automated. This paper investigates the application of machine learning methods and compares their ability to classify porosities from cross-section images of 3D printed metal parts. Fifty-one features are manually defined and automatically extracted from the images and the most relevant features among them are selected using feature reduction methods. Six machine learning algorithms that are commonly used for classification problems are trained with those features and used for the porosity classification. The decision tree, one of the six machine learning algorithms, yields 85% accuracy with a processing time of 0.5 s to classify porosities from 691 images. However, manual features may not adequately characterize porosity because they are dependent on user’s experience and judgment. Alternatively, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that does not require user-defined features is used for the classification problem.

Albeit the fact that FFF technology has been widely studied, the printing conditions that offer the optimum mechanical behavior exploiting numerical tools have not been systematically studied yet. The main goal of the study is to introduce machine learning-based models that predict the tensile strength of 3D printed parts and the development of an optimization tool, which infers the appropriate printing conditions according to the requirements of the user. The current paper deals with a computational and experimental study over the effect of specific process-related parameters and their impact on the mechanical behavior of an object manufactured via the FFF procedure. The data for the development of the predictive models and the numerical optimization module were acquired by manufacturing specimens with varying printing conditions. The results demonstrate that by adapting the suggested values on the printing parameters from the machine learning models and the optimization module, a remarkable enhancement on the mechanical properties of the printed parts can be achieved.

In recent decades, artificial intelligence-based data-driven approaches have made significant progress in machine fault diagnosis using monitoring data. However, current methods pay less attention to correlations and internal differences in monitoring data, resulting in limited diagnostic performance. In this paper, a data-driven method is proposed for the fault diagnosis of industrial robot reducers, that is, a dual-module attention convolutional neural network (DMA-CNN). This method aims to diagnose the fault state of industrial robot reducer. It establishes two parallel convolutional neural networks with two different attentions to capture the different features related to the fault. Finally, the features are fused to obtain the fault diagnosis results (normal or abnormal). The fault diagnosis effect of the DMA-CNN method and other attention models are compared and analyzed.

Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are intelligent systems based on a huge number of sensors and actuators. Due to safety concerns, traffic sign detection is one of the important systems in ADAS. Detecting traffic signs is an important factor to prevent accidents thanks to respecting traffic rules. However, building reliable traffic suitable for implementation on edge devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is a hard challenge. For this purpose, we proposed traffic signs detection based on convolutional neural networks. The YOLO object detection model was used as a detection framework. A lightweight backbone based on the squeezeNet model was proposed to achieve high performance with a light model that fits into the memory of the FPGA. Many optimization techniques have been applied to compress the model size such as pruning and quantization. The proposed traffic sign dataset was implemented on the pynq z1 platform. training and evaluating the model were performed on the Chinese traffic sign detection (CTSD) dataset.

Some experiments were carried out to determine the hot water ( $$hw$$ hw ) and cold water ( $$cw$$ cw ) outlet temperatures of CHE. As a result of the CFD analysis, the average outlet temperatures of the $$hw$$ hw and $$cw$$ cw flow loops on the CHE were calculated as 48.24 and 35.38 °C, respectively. On the other hand, the experimental outlet temperatures were measured as being 48.50 and 35.72 °C, respectively. The studies showed that the numerical and experimental results of the CHE are compliant at the given boundary conditions. Furthermore, it was observed that the heat transfer rate of the CHE with lower volume is approximately 47.7% higher than that of standard brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHEs) produced by traditional methods. More experiments conducted on the CHE will inevitably have a negative effect on its manufacture time and cost. Thus, various models were developed to predict the results of unperformed experiments using the machine learning methods, ANN, MLR and SVM. In the models developed for each experiment, the source and inlet temperatures of $$hw$$ hw and $$cw$$ cw , respectively, and the volumetric flow rate of $$cw$$ cw were selected as input parameters for the machine learning methods.

Race-tracking is generated by unexpected resin channels at mould edges that may induce dry spots and porosity formation. The ML model uses the pressure signals recorded by a sensor network as input, providing a classification of the race-tracking event from a set of possible scenarios, and a subsequent variable regression for their position, size and strength. Such a model is based on the residual network (ResNet), a well-known artificial intelligence architecture that makes use of convolutional neural networks for image recognition. Training of the ML classifier and regressors was carried out with the aid of a synthetically generated simulation data set obtained throughout computational fluid dynamics simulations. The time evolution of the pressure sensors was used as grey-level images, or footprints, as inputs to the ResNet ML. The trained model was able to recognise the presence of race-tracking channels from the pressure data yielding good accuracy in terms of label prediction as well as position, size and strength. The model correlation was carried out with a set of injection experiments performed with a constant thickness closed mould containing induced race-tracking channels.

An unexpected pump failure might result in a sudden collapse of the hydraulics, resulting in significant financial losses and the shutdown of the whole factory. Fault diagnosis plays a critical function in diagnosing flaws before they occur. Early detection is crucial for identifying problems and may save money, time, and potentially dangerous circumstances. Methods In recent years, many studies in intelligent fault diagnosis utilizing various machine learning approaches have been conducted. A vibration-based fault diagnosis in industrial mono-block centrifugal pumps is presented in this study.

A machine learning (ML) approach is used to overcome the high-dimensional dependency of NiTiHf TTs on numerous factors, as well as the lack of fully known governing physics. The elemental composition, thermal treatments, and post-processing steps that are commonly used to process NiTiHf and have an impact on the material phase transitions are used as input parameters of the neural network model (NN) to design the TTs. Such a feature selection led to the use of most of the accessible information in the literature on NiTiHf TTs, as all processing features required to be fed into the NN model. Considering most of the regular NiTiHf processing factors also enables the option of tuning additional characteristics of NiTiHf in addition to the TTs. The work is unique as all the four main TTs and their associated peak transformation temperatures are predicted to have complete control over the material phase change thresholds. Since 1995, extensive experimental research has been conducted to design NiTiHf TTs with a large temperature range of around 800 °C, paving the path for the current work’s ML algorithms to be fed. A thorough data collection is created using both unpublished data and available literature and then analyzed to select twenty input parameters to feed the NN model. To forecast the NiTiHf TTs, a total of 173 data points were gathered, verified, and selected.

However, the annotation of the component wear is not always easily identifiable, thus leading to the open issue of obtaining quality labeled data and interpreting it. This paper aims to introduce and test a Decision Support System (DSS) for solving a PdM task by overcoming the above-mentioned challenge while focusing on a real industrial use case, which includes advanced processing and measuring machines. In particular, the proposed DSS is comprised of the following cornerstones: data collection, feature extraction, predictive model, cloud storage, and data analysis. Differently from the related literature, our novel approach is based on a feature extraction strategy and ML prediction model powered by specific topics collected on the lower and upper levels of the production system.

The pellets had their properties compared to the commercial quality standard. Artificial neural networks and multivariate statistical models were used to validate the best treatments for biofuel production. The obtained pellets presented the minimum characteristics required by DIN EN 14961–6. However, the sugarcane bagasse biomass distinguished itself for use in energy pellets, more specifically, the treatment with 20% of fine charcoal because of its higher net calorific value (17.85 MJ·kg^−1) and energy density (13.30 GJ·m^−3), achieving the characteristics required for type A pellets in commercial standards. The statistical techniques were efficient and grouped the treatments with similar properties, as well as validated the sugarcane biomass mixed with charcoal fines for pellet production.

Industrial control systems have long been designed and established isolated from the outside world; however, due to the needs for development and performance improvement, these industrial systems have been connected to other organization networks. Since security requirements and predictions have not been considered, ICSs are faced with new security threats. Therefore, cybersecurity in industrial control systems is of utmost importance due to severe economic, environmental, human and political consequences. Hence, the design of intrusion detection systems based on industrial control systems is also essential. In the present study, an accurate ICS scheme is developed based on the capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). In the proposed scheme, we try to detect the spatial space of packets exclusively by employing convolutional networks. Passing through the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the time dependence between packets is used to diagnose abnormalities and attacks. Show that the proposed intrusion detection system outperforms other existing industrial intrusion detection systems in terms of accuracy.

A high volume of this process data is defect-free (majority class) and a lower volume of this data has defects (minority class) which result in the class-imbalance issue. Using imbalanced datasets, classifiers often provide sub-optimal classification results, i.e. better performance on the majority class than the minority class. However, it is important for process engineers that models classify defects more accurately than the class with no defects since this is crucial for quality inspection. Hence, we address the class-imbalance issue in manufacturing process data to support in-situ quality control of additive manufactured components. For this, we propose cluster-based adaptive data augmentation (CADA) for oversampling to address the class-imbalance problem. Quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and to compare with other selected oversampling methods using AM datasets from an aerospace industry and a publicly available casting manufacturing dataset. The results show that CADA outperformed random oversampling and the SMOTE method and is similar to random data augmentation and cluster-based oversampling. Furthermore, the results of the statistical significance test show that there is a significant difference between the studied methods. As such, the CADA method can be considered as an alternative method for oversampling to improve the performance of models on the minority class.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-022-07347-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Implementation of structural health monitoring (SHM) methods to these parts would let them gain continuous sensing and damage identification capability. The small size and very strong vibration damping characteristics of additively manufactured polymer parts do not allow the direct use of many SHM methods. In this study, detection and location estimation of compressive force applied to an additively manufactured part made of PLA was examined. The test specimen was designed with multiple skin thicknesses in each of the five zones and completely digital excitation was implemented on the part. Surface Response to the Excitation (SuRE) method was used in this study. Two piezoelectric elements were used for exciting the specimen with lamb waves from one side and recording the dynamic response to excitation at the other end of the part. The digital excitation included multiple pulses with different widths covering a wide range of exciting frequencies. Two different methods were used for damage localization, Deep Learning (DL) and the two-dimensional sum of the squares of differences (2DSSD). Short-time Fourier Transformation (STFT) was used to convert the experimental time-domain sensory data into the time–frequency domain (spectrograms).

Second-generation (2G) ethanol arises as one biofuel with great potential, due to not only maintaining food security, but also as a product from economically interesting crops such as energy-cane. One of the main challenges of 2G ethanol is the inefficient uptake of pentose sugars by industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the main organism used for ethanol production. Understanding the main drivers for xylose assimilation and identify novel and efficient transporters is a key step to make the 2G process economically viable. Results By implementing a strategy of searching for present motifs that may be responsible for xylose transport and past adaptations of sugar transporters in xylose fermenting species, we obtained a classifying model which was successfully used to select four different candidate transporters for evaluation in the S. cerevisiae hxt-null strain, EBY.VW4000, harbouring the xylose consumption pathway. Yeast cells expressing the transporters SpX, SpH and SpG showed a superior uptake performance in xylose compared to traditional literature control Gxf1. Conclusions Modelling xylose transport with the small data available for yeast and bacteria proved a challenge that was overcome through different statistical strategies. Through this strategy, we present four novel xylose transporters which expands the repertoire of candidates targeting yeast genetic engineering for industrial fermentation. The repeated use of the model for characterizing new transporters will be useful both into finding the best candidates for industrial utilization and to increase the model’s predictive capabilities.

Indeed, there are several real-world AAD application domains, including working machines and in-vehicle intelligence (the main target of this research project). This paper introduces three deep AutoEncoders (AE) for unsupervised AAD tasks, namely a Dense AE, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) AE and Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder (LSTM) AE. To tune the deep learning architectures, development data were adopted from public domain audio datasets related with working machines. A large set of computational experiments was held, showing that the three proposed deep autoencoders, when combined with a melspectrogram sound preprocessing, are quite competitive and outperform a recently proposed AE baseline. Next, on a second experimental stage, aiming to address the final in-vehicle passenger safety goal, the three AEs were adapted to learn from in-vehicle normal audio, assuming three realistic scenarios that were generated by a synthetic audio mixture tool. In general, a high quality AAD discrimination was obtained: working machine data – 72% to 91%; and in-vehicle audio – 78% to 81%. In conjunction with an automotive company, an in-vehicle AAD intelligent system prototype was further developed, aiming to test a selected model (LSTM AE) during a pilot demonstration event that targeted the cough anomaly. Interesting results were obtained, with the AAD system presenting a high cough classification accuracy (e.g., 100% for front seat locations).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-022-07375-2,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents an innovative data-driven causality modeling approach using interpretable machine learning and process mining techniques, in addition to human expertise, to efficiently and automatically capture the complex dynamics of industrial systems. The approach tackles a significant challenge in the causality analysis community, which is the discovery of high-level causal models from low-level continuous observations. It is based on the exploitation of event data logs by analyzing the dependency relationships between events to generate accurate multi-level models that can take the form of various state-event diagrams. Highly accurate and trustworthy patterns are extracted from the original data using interpretable machine learning integrated with a model enhancement technique to construct event data logs. Afterward, the causal model is generated from the event log using the inductive miner technique, which is one of the most powerful process mining techniques. The causal model generated is a Petri net model, which is used to infer causality between important events as well as a visualization tool for real-time tracking of the system’s dynamics.

Drilling oil and gas well is a very challenging task and requires deep knowledge of the wellbore behavior to complete drilling operations successfully. A stuck pipe problem occurs when the drill pipe is unable to reciprocate and rotate inside the wellbore. A stuck pipe incident is a non-productive time (NPT) of drilling operations which is one of the major reasons for overrunning the budget of the project. This paper mainly focuses on various data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction of stuck pipe incidents along with the detailed discussion of various stuck pipe mechanisms and major significant drilling, well fluid, and formation parameters to enhance the performance of prediction models. According to the previous researches, traditional methods that were used to process fast high-dimensional data to predict stuck pipe incidents were inefficient, but these data-driven machine learning algorithms are capable of handling such data to extract meaningful patterns from the data. It has also been observed that the accuracy of the predictive models depends on the parameters selected for analysis. Hence, in this paper, some major parameters that are not incorporated by the previous researchers such as formation type and geomechanical stresses values are thoroughly discussed.

In particular, this paper investigates the combination of deep learning and decomposition for the image retrieval problem which is central for visual navigation. A convolutional neural network is first used to extract relevant features from the image database. The database is then decomposed into clusters of visually similar images, where several algorithms have been explored in order to make the clusters as independent as possible. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach is then applied on each cluster to build a vocabulary forest. During the searching process the vocabulary forest is exploited to find the most relevant images to the query image. To validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out using both standard datasets and images from industrial environments.

To reduce the human intervention in the design process, the present study proposed a novel methodology with the following major steps: 1) using Poisson disk sampling (PDS) to preselect candidate gate locations automatically within the suitable gating region specified by designers; 2) using a space-filling initialization strategy and efficient global optimization to find the optimal gate locations. In the present setting, the molding gate design problem is formalized as a discrete optimization problem. The PDS is employed to construct the discrete solution space and EGO is used to efficiently search through a large solution space for the best design. To further promote optimization efficiency, a parallel implementation of EGO is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated in two design cases.

Their manufacturing process typically consists of a design phase followed by planning and executing a production process of components required in the subsequent assembly. Production delays can lead to a delayed start of the assembly. Predicting potentially delayed components—we call those components assembly start delayers—in early phases of the manufacturing process can support an on-time assembly. In recent research, prediction models typically include information about the orders, workstations, and the status of the manufacturing system, but information about the design of the component is not used. Since the components of machine and plant manufacturers are designed specifically for the customer needs, we assumed that material data influence the quality of a model predicting assembly start delayers. To analyze our hypothesis, we followed the established CRISP-DM method to set up 12 prediction models at an exemplary chosen machine and plant manufacturer utilizing a binary classification approach. These 12 models differentiated in the utilization of material data—including or excluding material data—and in the utilized machine learning algorithm—six algorithms per data case. Evaluating the different models revealed a positive impact of the material data on the model quality. With the achieved results, our study validates the benefit of using material data in models predicting assembly start delayers.

In its very nature, such “industrial big data” can relay its usefulness to reach further utilitarian applications. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) is among the major predictive modeling approaches that can enable manufacturing researchers and practitioners to improve the product quality and achieve resource efficiency by exploiting large amounts of data (which is collected during manufacturing process). However, disposing ML algorithms is a challenging task for manufacturing industrial actors due to the prior specification of one or more algorithms hyperparameters (HPs) and their values. Moreover, manufacturing industrial actors often lack the technical expertise to apply advanced analytics. Consequently, it necessitates frequent consultations with data scientists; but such collaborations tends to cost the delays, which can generate the risks such as human-resource bottlenecks. As the complexity of these tasks increases, so does the demand for support solutions. In response, the field of automated ML (AutoML) is a data mining-based formalism that aims to reduce human effort and speedup the development cycle through automation. In this regard, existing approaches include evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning. These approaches mainly focus on providing the user assistance by automating the partial or entire data analysis process, but they provide very limited details concerning their impact on the analysis. The major goal of these conventional approaches has been generally focused on the performance factors, while the other important and even crucial aspects such as computational complexity are rather omitted. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel meta-learning based approach to automate ML predictive models built over the industrial big data. The approach is leveraged with development of, AMLBID, an Automated ML tool for Big Industrial Data analyses. It attempts to support the manufacturing engineers and researchers who presumably have meager skills to carry out the advanced analytics. The empirical results show that AMLBID surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and could retrieve the usefulness of large manufacturing data to prosper the research in manufacturing domain and improve the use of predictive models instead of precluding their outcomes.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-022-00612-4,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, most of the existing 3D scan technologies are time consuming due to either contact mode or algorithm complexity, which are not capable of obtaining the surface morphology data in an online manner during the printing process. To implement online layer-wise surface morphological data acquisition in AM processes, one practical solution is to model the correlation between 2D images and 3D point cloud data. In practice, since this correlation is usually highly complex due to the high dimensionality and non-linearity, it is usually impractical to find an explicit mathematical transfer function to quantify this correlation effectively. To address this issue, a deep learning-based model is developed in this study, in which a powerful deep learning algorithm, namely, convolutional neural network (CNN), is incorporated. With the trained CNN model, the 3D surface data can be predicted directly without the relatively time consuming triangulation computation by the 3D scanner. Thus, the speed of surface data acquisition and morphology measurement can be improved. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology, both simulation and real-world AM case studies were performed. The results show that the prediction accuracy using the proposed method is promising. In terms of averaged relative prediction error, it can be mostly lower than 10% in the experiments. Therefore, the proposed method has a great potential for online layer-wise surface morphology measurement in AM.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-022-01933-0,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While these advantages make AM an attractive option for industry, determining process parameters which result in specific properties, such as the level of porosity and tensile strength, can be a long and costly endeavour. In this review, the state-of-the-art in the control of part properties in AM is examined, including the effect of microstructure on part properties. The simulation of microstructure formation via numerical simulation and machine learning is examined which can provide process quality control and has the potential to aid in rapid process optimisation via closed loop control. In-situ monitoring of the AM process, is also discussed as a route to enable first time right production in the AM process, along with the hybrid approach of AM fabrication with post-processing steps such as shock peening, heat treatment and rolling.

In a realistic VRP environment, uncertainty or variability with constituent features and its values are the norm. We formulate and solve this class of vehicle routing problem as: (1) a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach with box and ellipsoidal robust optimization mathematical model to handle uncertainty, (2) a MILP based exact box robust optimization mathematical model to handle uncertainty, and (3) a dynamic attention model based reinforcement learning approach to handle uncertainty. We have conducted computational experiments to analyse the impact of effectiveness on solution quality, problem scale, and solution performance in accounting for feature data uncertainty. Our study indicates that accounting for feature data variability using robust optimization approaches impacts solution cost. Simulation results using MILP based Robust optimization (MILP_RO) approaches and Attention Model (AM) based deep reinforcement (DRL) learning approaches show that we can cope with uncertainties to feature data without much of an impact to cost and performance for input customer graphs of smaller to medium node counts.

These perspectives emphasise the autonomy of the language model rather than the autonomy of human actors in AI systems. I highlight the existence of deterministic perspectives in the current AI discourse (which range from technological utopianism to dystopianism), with a specific focus on the two issues of: (1) GPT-3’s potential intentional misuse for manipulation and (2) unintentional harm caused by bias. In response, I find that a contextual approach to GPT-3, which is centred upon wider ecologies of societal harm and benefit, human autonomy, and human values, illuminates practical solutions to concerns about manipulation and bias. Additionally, although OpenAI’s newest 2022 language model InstructGPT represents a small step in reducing toxic language and aligning GPT-3 with user intent, it does not provide any compelling solutions to manipulation or bias.

Use of machine learning in manufacturing environments is increasing, yet sometimes these applications fail to produce meaningful results. A critical review of how defects are classified is needed to appropriately apply machine learning in a production foundry and other manufacturing processes. Four elements associated with defect classification are proposed: Binary Acceptance Specifications, Stochastic Formation of Defects, Secondary Process Variation, and Visual Defect Inspection. These four elements create data space overlap, which influences the bias associated with training supervised machine learning algorithms. If this influence is significant enough, the predicted error of the model exceeds a critical error threshold (CET). There is no financial motivation to implement the ML model in the manufacturing environment if its error is greater than the CET.

It is important for automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to utilize high-quality battery cells to ensure high performance and safety of their vehicles. This results in the high demand for quality control measures and inspection methods in battery cell manufacturing. Particular relevant features of battery cells are welds for the internal electrical contact. Failures of these welds are often the cause for battery defects in the field and scrap during production. Consequently, there is a strong need to evaluate all welds during manufacturing. However, there is no established method that allows a quick, comprehensive, and cheap inline measurement of the weld quality. This paper presents a new eddy current-based method for nondestructive testing of seam welds as well as a machine learning approach for its validation. A deep learning model has been trained on eddy current measurements to predict results from a reference inspection method, in this case computer tomography. The results prove that eddy current measurements can be used to replicate data acquired by computer tomography, which means that eddy current measurements could be a suitable candidate for nondestructive 100 % inline inspection. More general, this study demonstrates how machine learning may help to get deeper insights into measurement results and to validate new nondestructive testing techniques whose detailed features are yet unknown. The presented evaluation method enables understanding the capabilities and the limits of a new technique and to extract hidden features from the data. In terms of defect segmentation, the trained model applied to an eddy current test data set achieves an accuracy of 93.7 %.

Previous domain-specific contributions often utilized classical computer vision approaches, whereas more novel systems deploy deep learning based ones. However, a persistent problem in the domain stems from the recognition of very small defect patterns which are often in the size of only a few $$\mu $$ μ m and pixels within vast amounts of high-resolution imagery. While these defect patterns occur on the significantly larger wafer surface, classical machine and deep learning solutions have problems in dealing with the complexity of this challenge. This contribution introduces a novel hybrid multistage system of stacked deep neural networks (SH-DNN) which allows the localization of the finest structures within pixel size via a classical computer vision pipeline, while the classification process is realized by deep neural networks. The proposed system draws the focus over the level of detail from its structures to more task-relevant areas of interest. As the created test environment shows, our SH-DNN-based multistage system surpasses current approaches of learning-based automated visual inspection. The system reaches a performance (F1-score) of up to 99.5%, corresponding to a relative improvement of the system’s fault detection capabilities by 8.6-fold.

The benefits from CSR like generating better public image, enhance in community support, enhance in market share, enhance in the satisfaction of the consumer, enhance in the exports, offering better quality services and products, and enhance in the productivity is not considered as the perception level consumers. This paper analyzes the effect of CSR activities on the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries on the basis of the retention of the consumers of FMCG products. Initially, a questionnaire is prepared that consists of five categories. Each category is composed of more than ten questions. The information related to the questionnaire is obtained in the view of the professional students from Odisha. The customers are requested to fill the exact information as much as possible. Next, a higher-order statistical analysis is considered for realizing the behaviour of the categories. Additionally, the usage of deep learning called Optimized RNN (O-RNN) is used for predicting the customer retention in maintaining the CSR on FMCG industries. The improvement in the traditional RNN is done by optimizing the hidden neurons by the improved form of Sea Lion Optimization Algorithm (slno) called Modified slno (M-slno) with the intention of minimizing the error among the actual and the predicted outcome, hence it is called as O-RNN. The retention of the customers regarding the effect of CSR activities on FMCG companies and the benefits from CSR is investigated using the O-RNN prediction analysis against several traditional deep learning models as well as different statistical measures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40747-021-00537-0,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Currently, 3D printers based on filament extrusion are the most common type in the market and are well known to consumers because of their low price and availability. In order to reduce the difficulty of printing procedures, the basic mode provided by the slicing software can achieve normal printing quality. However, this way is still difficult to solve the problem of mastering key parameters for higher printing quality. This study aims to overcome this problem by developing an artificial intelligence system based on case-based reasoning method, allowing users to rapidly obtain the advanced printing parameters for enhancing the printing quality. The first step uses the input information by the users to retrieve the most similar case from the case library in the index system for the users to examine. If the case features meet the need of the users, then they are applied in the printing. Conversely, a case revision technique is used to solve the incompatible features. It will print after solving the incompatibility. Finally, the features and the printing parameters of the new object are retained to the case library to increase the resolution capability of the system.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-022-08672-9,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Solubility prediction, as an alternative to experiments which can reduce waste and improve crystallization process efficiency, has attracted increasing attention. However, there are still many urgent challenges thus far. Herein we used seven descriptors based on understanding dissolution behavior to establish two solubility prediction models by machine learning algorithms. The solubility data of 120 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in ethanol were considered in the prediction models, which were constructed by random decision forests and artificial neural network with optimized data structure and model accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison with traditional prediction methods including the modified solubility equation and the quantitative structure-property relationships model was carried out. The highest accuracy shown by the testing set proves that the ML models have the best solubility prediction ability. Multiple linear regression and stepwise regression were used to further investigate the critical factor in determining solubility value. The results revealed that the API properties and the solute-solvent interaction both provide a nonnegligible contribution to the solubility value.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11705-021-2083-5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The massive disruption of the supply chain of production is affecting manufacturing companies operating in and around India. Particularly the medium-sized bus body building works have been reduced, due to its compound anomalies. The integrated view of the production facility priorities is not an easy task. Since it is difficult for available labour to conduct an entire project, the completion of a production process is delayed. But still, the dilemma remains as to how production managers can correctly interpret the priorities of the facility. Indeed, this is a problem missing from the previous study. Fortunately, in the current competitive environment, it is essentially needed. This study has been used Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) approach for predicting production facility priorities. The experimental results confirm the suitability of the model for predicting priorities. A real-world problem is taken into account in making use of the model output.

The analysis and forecasting of such a huge quantities of data is a great task that cannot be solved using standard methods. To handle this issue, we designed and developed an intelligent deep learning (DL) model based on the concept of stacked self-coding network, which uses a DL framework for decision making at the backend.

The quality of LPDC parts is highly influenced by the casting process conditions. A need exists to optimize the process variables to improve the part quality against difficult defects such as gas and shrinkage porosity. To do this, process variable measurements need to be studied against occurrence rates of defects. In this paper, industry 4.0 cloud-based systems are used to extract data. With these data, supervised machine learning classification models are proposed to identify conditions that predict defectives in a real foundry Aluminum LPDC process. The root cause analysis is difficult, because the rate of defectives in this process occurred in small percentages and against many potential process measurement variables. A model based on the XGBoost classification algorithm was used to map the complex relationship between process conditions and the creation of defective wheel rims. Data were collected from a particular LPDC machine and die mold over three shifts and six continuous days. Porosity defect occurrence rates could be predicted using 36 features from 13 process variables collected from a considerably small sample (1077 wheels) which was highly skewed (62 defectives) with 87% accuracy for good parts and 74% accuracy for parts with porosity defects.

In the current work, a machine learning-based predictive modeling and control strategy is proposed for the attainment of lean manufacturing (LM) through effective management of manufacturing flexibility. Firstly, lean manufacturing models were identified based on machine, labour, volume, routing, product flexibilities and material handling for forty six auto parts manufacturing companies in Pune region (India). As many as twenty three lean manufacturing models were derived based on system identification (control theory) structures: auto regressive with exogenous variables (ARX), auto regressive moving average with exogenous variables (ARMAX), output error (OE) and Box Jenkins (BJ) methods. All predictive models were compared for their relative performances based on validation indices such as the FIT%, mean squared error (MSE), final prediction error (FPE) and the number of model parameters. The ARX 750 structure attained the best predictive characteristics for LM (FIT 91.86%). This model was controlled for a set point of 0.8 LM level and corresponding levels of flexibilities were determined. The machine flexibility (MF) was identified to be the most significant contributor to lean manufacturing at a level of 0.7596. Consequently, MF was also modeled based on its seven sub parameters. The ARMAX 2120 structure obtained the best performance characteristics (FIT 99.94%) for MF modeling.

The presented study summarizes the relevant state of the art in both research areas and lays out how their respective accomplishments can be combined to achieve higher degrees of autonomy in robotic construction within the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. A distributed control and communication infrastructure for agent training and task execution is presented, that leverages the potentials of combining tools, standards and algorithms of both fields. It is geared towards industrial CDRF applications. Using this framework, a robotic agent is trained to autonomously plan and build structures using two model-free DRL algorithms (TD3, SAC) in two case studies: robotic block stacking and sensor-adaptive 3D printing. The first case study serves to demonstrate the general applicability of computational design environments for DRL training and the comparative learning success of the utilized algorithms. Case study two highlights the benefit of our setup in terms of tool path planning, geometric state reconstruction, the incorporation of fabrication constraints and action evaluation as part of the training and execution process through parametric modeling routines.

First, porosity mechanisms according to additive manufacturing (AM) processing conditions were studied using traditional scanning acoustic microscopy and optical microscopy. Second, correlations between ultrasonic properties and porosity content were analyzed. The correlation results showed that the increased porosity content resulted in a decreased ultrasonic velocity and increased ultrasonic attenuation coefficient. Third, various levels of porosities were evaluated using a deep learning model based on a fully connected deep neural network that was trained on raw ultrasonic signals measured in the AM samples.

Since the ground workforce cannot be aware of their surrounding environment during the current crane operations in busy and complex sites, accidents and even fatalities are not avoidable. Hence, deploying an automatic and accurate top-view human detection solution would make significant improvements to the health and safety of the workforce on such industrial operational sites. The proposed method (CraneNet) is a new machine learning empowered solution to increase the visibility of a crane operator in complex industrial operational environments while addressing the challenges of human detection from top-view on a resource-constrained small-form PC to meet the space constraint in the operator’s cabin. CraneNet consists of 4 modified ResBlock-D modules to fulfill the real-time requirements. To increase the accuracy of small humans at high altitudes which is crucial for this use-case, a PAN (Path Aggregation Network) was designed and added to the architecture. This enhances the structure of CraneNet by adding a bottom-up path to spread the low-level information. Furthermore, three output layers were employed in CraneNet to further improve the accuracy of small objects. Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) was integrated at the end of the backbone stage which increases the receptive field of the backbone, thereby increasing the accuracy. The CraneNet has achieved 92.59% of accuracy at 19 FPS on a portable device. The proposed machine learning model has been trained with the Standford Drone Dataset and Visdrone 2019 to further show the efficacy of the smart crane approach.

A significant contributor to this “interpretability-adoption gap” is the prevalence of black-box models and the lack of built-in methods for model interpretation. While established methods for evaluating model performance exist, an intuitive understanding of the modeling and decision-making processes in models is nonetheless desired in many cases.

We show that CrabNet learns meaningful, material property-specific element representations based solely on the data with no additional supervision. These element representations can then be used to explore element identity, similarity, behavior, and interactions within different chemical environments. Chemical compounds can also be uniquely represented and examined to reveal clear structures and trends within the chemical space. Additionally, visualizations of the attention mechanism can be used in conjunction to further understand the modeling process, identify potential modeling or dataset errors, and hint at further chemical insights leading to a better understanding of the phenomena governing material properties.

Firstly, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to preprocess the original data set to eliminate its correlation. Secondly, Adaboost algorithm is used to continuously adjust the weight of training samples, to obtain the optimal weight and threshold of BP neural network. The results show that there are 13,817 pieces of data collected in the industrial control experiment, of which 9817 pieces of data are taken as the test data set, including 9770 pieces of normal data and 47 pieces of abnormal data. In addition, as a test data set of 4000 pieces, there are 3987 pieces of normal data and 13 pieces of abnormal data.

The batch studies were performed for naproxen degradation by varying the reaction variables such as ozone flow rate, initial pH and pollutant concertation. It was observed that almost 90% degradation was achieved at pH = 4, ozone flow rate = 3 L min^−1 and initial naproxen concentration = 5 mg L^−1. The catalyst exhibited constant activity even after seven successive cycles. Comparative studies among sorption, ozonation, photocatalysis, catalytic ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation revealed that the later process had the highest degradation of pollutant. Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to simulate the performance of visible-light photocatalytic ozonation in naproxen degradation. The developed ANN model could estimate the visible-light photocatalytic ozonation process under the different experimental conditions. Finally, the applicability of the photocatalytic ozonation was successfully approved for industrial wastewater treatment. The results showed that the COD removal efficiency reached 65% within 150 min.

In this context, we present an approach for the intelligent predetection of projected reference markers in robot-based inspection systems. These markers support the alignment of different sensor views and do not need to be physically attached to any parts. However, their robust detection is challenging under unfavorable lighting conditions. Hence, we introduce trained models of a cascade classifier based on both synthetic and real image data. Subsequently, we present the detection performance for different shapes and designs of markers projected onto real-world sheet metal parts as used in the automotive industry. The results demonstrate that properly trained classifiers can achieve a recall and precision of 90% and higher.

Part manufacturing generally involves material additive or material subtractive processes. Turning is one of the commonly used subtractive processes. Many statistical analysis, modeling approaches, and optimization algorithms have been attempted to predict the optimal surface finish of the machined part. These techniques are employed to achieve the best quality at low production cost. In this research, a machine learning (ML) model was developed to predict the surface finish of the component during turning of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material. The experiments were performed at different machining conditions to acquire datasets. Each dataset had four independent variables (cutting parameters) and one response variable. Exploratory data analysis was carried out on the experimental data and the significance ( p  < 0.05) of cutting parameters on surface finish of the part was confirmed. The machining data are observed discrete and nonlinear in characteristic. For training the machine, two algorithms such as polynomial regression and kernel-based support vector regression (SVR) were attempted. Eighty percentage of datasets were used for training while the remaining twenty percentage was used for testing. The prediction models were tuned continuously to achieve the best performance. The kernel-based SVR model is found superior to other model in terms of accuracy and performance in the prediction. The predicted results from SVR model were validated by conducting further experiments. The error rate between well-tuned ML model ( R ^2 = 0.82) and validation results is found as $$\Delta R_{{\text{a}}} =$$ Δ R a = $$\Delta {R}_{\mathrm{a}}=\Delta {R}_{\mathrm{a}}=$$ Δ R a = Δ R a = Δ R _a = 1.73% only.

The current study analyzed the fall protection performance of Type I industrial helmets and evaluated if the use of a chin strap and the suspension system tightness have any effect on protection performance. Head impact tests were performed using an instrumented manikin. There were 12 combinations of test conditions: with or without chin strap usage, three levels of suspension system tightness, and two impact surfaces. Four representative helmet models (two basic and two advanced models) were selected for the study. Impact tests without a helmet under all other applicable test conditions were used as a control group. There were four replicates for each test condition—a total of 192 impact tests with helmets and eight impact tests for the control group. The peak acceleration and the calculated head impact criteria (HIC) were used to evaluate shock absorption performance of the helmets. The results showed that all four helmet models demonstrated excellent performance for fall protection compared to the barehead control group.

Recent AM literature utilising machine learning methods tend to make predictions about flaws or porosity without considering the dynamical nature of the process. This leads to increases in false detections as useful information about the signal is lost. This study takes a different approach and investigates learning a physical model of the laser powder bed fusion process dynamics. In addition, deep representation learning enables this to be achieved directly from high speed videos. This representation is combined with a predictive state space model which is learned in a semi-supervised manner, requiring only the optimal laser parameter to be characterised. The model, referred to as FlawNet, was exploited to measure offsets between predicted and observed states resulting in a highly robust metric, known as the dynamic signature. This feature also correlated strongly with a global material quality metric, namely porosity. The model achieved state-of-the-art results with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.999 when differentiating between optimal and unstable laser parameters. Furthermore, there was a demonstrated potential to detect changes in ultra-dense, 0.1% porosity, materials with an ROC AUC of 0.944, suggesting an ability to detect anomalous events prior to the onset of significant material degradation. The method has merit for the purposes of detecting out of process distributions, while maintaining data efficiency.

Within this process, already existing load cells were substituted and additional inductive and magnetic displacement sensors were applied. After calibration, those were fully integrated into a six-layer digitalization architecture at the Smart Forming Lab at the Chair of Metal Forming (Montanuniversitaet Leoben). Within this framework, two front end human machine interfaces were designed, where the first one serves as a condition monitoring system during the rolling process. The second user interface visualizes the result of a resilient machine learning algorithm, which was designed using Python and is not just able to predict and adapt the resulting rolling schedule of a defined metal sheet, but also to learn from additional rolling mill schedules carried out. This algorithm was created on the basis of a black box approach, using data from more than 1900 milling steps with varying roll gap height, sheet width and friction conditions. As a result, the developed program is able to interpolate and extrapolate between these parameters as well as different initial sheet thicknesses, serving as a digital twin for data-based recommendations on schedule changes between different rolling process steps. Furthermore, via the second user interface, it is possible to visualize the influence of this parameters on the result of the milling process. As the whole layer system runs on an internal server at the university, students and other interested parties are able to access the visualization and can therefore use the environment to deepen their knowledge within the characteristics and influence of the sheet metal rolling process as well as data science and especially fundamentals of machine learning. This algorithm also serves as a basis for further integration of materials science based data for the prediction of the influence of different materials on the rolling result.

However, SCADA systems are continuously exposed to various heterogeneous cyberattacks, making the detection task using the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) very challenging. Furthermore, conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, and antivirus software, are not appropriate for fully protecting SCADA systems because they have distinct specifications. Thus, accurately detecting cyber-attacks in critical SCADA systems is undoubtedly indispensable to enhance their resilience, ensure safe operations, and avoid costly maintenance. The overarching goal of this paper is to detect malicious intrusions that already detoured traditional IDS and firewalls. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is introduced to identify malicious attacks targeting SCADA systems. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a deep learning approach for intrusion detection in SCADA systems. Real data sets from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, a two-line three-bus power transmission system and a gas pipeline are used to evaluate the proposed method’s performance.

Determining laser heat treatment process parameters is important to achieve the sought material performance; however, the technique’s high speed makes it difficult to record the thermal history of the part via standard measurement techniques. Furthermore conducting experiments to explore the effect of process parameters is costly. This work aimed at designing a laser heat treatment to be applied to as-deposited copper cold spray coating to meet a 30% through-thickness hardness reduction. An artificial neural network model was developed and used to find laser heat treatment conditions allowing meeting the sought hardness reduction. The thermal histories were obtained through thermal modeling of the laser heating process and the resulting hardness reductions obtained experimentally. This allowed the neural network to correlate the local hardness reduction (model output) to local thermal history (model input). The model was capable of predicting the local hardness reduction of the part according to the local thermal history resulting from various laser heat treatment conditions and thus, may eventually be used to assist in process parameters selection and optimization.

The quality of the system model is critical to controller performance and should adequately describe the process dynamics across its operating range while remaining amenable to fast optimization. This work articulates an integrated system identification procedure for deriving black-box nonlinear continuous-time multiple-input multiple-output system models for nonlinear model predictive control. To showcase this approach, five candidate models for polynomial and interaction features of both output and manipulated variables were trained on simulated data and integrated into a nonlinear model predictive controller for a highly nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor system. This procedure successfully identified system models that enabled effective control in both servo and regulator problems across wider operating ranges. These controllers also had reasonable per-iteration times of ca. 0.1 s. This demonstration of how such system models could be identified for nonlinear model predictive control without prior knowledge of system dynamics opens further possibilities for direct data-driven methodologies for model-based control which, in the face of process uncertainties or modelling limitations, allow rapid and stable control over wider operating ranges.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11705-021-2058-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This era is witnessing a rapid transformation in digital technology and AI where brain-inspired computing-based solutions will play a vital role in industrial informatics. The application of CCPS with brain-inspired computing in Industry 4.0 will create a significant impact on industrial evolution. Though the CCPSs in industrial environment offer several merits, security remains a challenging design issue. The rise of artificial intelligence AI techniques helps to address cybersecurity issues related to CCPS in industry 4.0 environment. With this motivation, this paper presents a new AI-enabled multimodal fusion-based intrusion detection system (AIMMF-IDS) for CCPS in industry 4.0 environment. The proposed model initially performs the data pre-processing technique in two ways namely data conversion and data normalization. In addition, improved fish swarm optimization based feature selection (IFSO-FS) technique is used for the appropriate selection of features. The IFSO technique is derived by the use of Levy Flight (LF) concept into the searching mechanism of the conventional FSO algorithm to avoid the local optima problem. Since the single modality is not adequate to accomplish enhanced detection performance, in this paper, a weighted voting based ensemble model is employed for the multimodal fusion process using recurrent neural network (RNN), bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM), and deep belief network (DBN), depicts the novelty of the work.

In this paper, a machine learning algorithm is proposed for powder-saving and support-free process planning in multi-axis metal AM, improving the printing efficiency and the surface quality of printed blade. Firstly, a self-adaptive spectral clustering algorithm is developed to carry out two functions: one is to decompose the blade into sub-blocks in a global view; the other one is to automatically obtain the optimal clustering number, addressing the contradiction issue between printing efficiency and decomposition performance. Secondly, the global constraint formula and the normalized area weight are introduced to obtain main printing orientations (MPOs). Each sub-block can be built along the corresponding MPO with high-quality surface, free support, and low powder leakage. A sample blade is built on the 3 + 2 axis laser metal deposition (LMD) machine to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Due to repetitive actions and subsequent awkward postures, the sewing machine operators are prone to the risk of Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders—WMSDs, which results in temporary or permanent disability among the operators. The study aimed to develop a Risk Assessment System that identifies the level of risk factors involved and eventually computing the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) score of each operator. The discrete posture evaluation of the sewing operators was done by tracking the body joints of the operators using their videos while per-forming the tasks. Several socio-demographic, psychological, and work-related details were also factored in through a structured questionnaire for testing and validation. In total 72 videos recorded from either side of different sewing operators, were analyzed at the speed of 30 frames per second. A system was successfully developed by applying various machine learning algorithms to compute the RULA score by extracting the different joint angles of the operators like Neck, Upper and Lower Arm & Trunk directly from the video captured. Such a Risk Assessment System developed shall help in understanding the work conditions operators work in and eventually guide in reducing the risk of WMSDs through precautionary measures against the risk. Other benefits may include productivity enhancement, improving overall health, and reducing the rate of absenteeism, which continues to be a major concern among the factory owners and the Ready-made garment industry, in general.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-94277-9_120,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Tuna fishing vessels that fish with FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices) face an optimization problem in a dynamic scenario never seen before in other industries. Solving this issue can help this industry to minimize fuel consumption and emissions to the atmosphere. Considering the optimization challenge in greater detail, the problems to solve are two. The first is the basic case in which a tuna fishing vessel equipped with N buoys or FADs wants to know the best route to visit them all. The second goes further and tries to reach the same solution when a group of M vessels shares N FADs. In this second case, a more global solution is needed, including multiple vessels and more FADs to visit, but it can solve the global optimization problem for an entire fleet of tuna fishing vessels, with optimal results. The combination of AI algorithms and prediction is key to finding a solution for such a complex, dynamic environment. Specifically, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a prediction method. This is an academic novelty and gives excellent results in comparison with the current industry standard and with the literature covering the best techniques for solving this problem. Moreover, the solution suggested is a new kind of global solution that is valid for both static and dynamic scenarios. The proposed solution is tested using real data from the fleet. Results show how profitable it is for the firm, as well as for the planet, greatly reducing emissions to the atmosphere and helping the tuna fishing industry to be more sustainable.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-91006-8_7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of these advanced technologies are embedded in the so-called fourth industrial revolution (4IR), such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, automation and robotics, quantum computing, big data, 5G networking, and the “Internet of Things” (IoT). At the same time, most research and development (R & D) taking place in the 4IR is occurring in the commercial realm. The usefulness of 4IR technologies to future military capabilities will depend on how well countries can leverage breakthroughs in commercial R & D, via military-civil fusion (MCF). China and Russia are pursuing concurrent and often intertwined R & D programs to develop and advance 4IR technologies in their respective countries—particularly AI—and to subsequently utilize these technologies (via MCF) in military applications. Their mutual interests in exploiting cutting-edge technologies to underwrite military modernization could motivate Beijing and Moscow to collaborate on future 4IR R & D. Nevertheless, such cooperation could be limited. In particular, Russia lacks the resources or overall technological capacities (money and manpower, plus an already low level of innovation in the national economy) to function as an equal to China, and it may not wish to play the junior partner in such a relationship.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-97012-3_7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper introduces an approach that allows estimating the orientation and movement trend of a person in the vicinity of a robotized industrial task, aiming to avoid the collision between human and robot. As a previous requirement of the approach, a PointNet architecture was trained with the point clouds obtained from Depth images of a proprietary RGB-D image dataset. This task, in turn, required detecting people in the corresponding RGB images, through the application of a pre-trained saliency algorithm. To estimate the orientation of the detected person, a modified Biternion network was trained with the resized images from the same proprietary database. At evaluating the system, depth images captured by a Kinect sensor were used as inputs, then, for a set of four iterations (four frames), the movement trend was calculated since the orientation of the person was known for every frame.

Then we propose an adaptive data injection mechanism for TSN based on per-stream filtering and policing (PSFP), which dynamically adjusts the priority of data for queue injection in TSN. To further reduce the long tail of delay, we employ a risk-sensitive learning method to improve the worst-case delay.

Especially, neural network (NN) strategies have focused on finding complex and nonlinear relationships between the sensor signal and the machine status to detect machine faults. However, it is difficult to collect enough amount of fault data as much as normal status data for training general NN models. To resolve the issue, this paper proposes the autoencoder-based anomaly detection framework for industrial robot arms using an internal sound sensor. The autoencoder uses signals in the normal state of the robots for training the model. It reconstructs the input signals as output, and anomalous states are found from high reconstruction error. Two stethoscopes were attached to the surface of the robot joint as sensors, and the sounds were recorded by USB microphone attached to the outlet of the stethoscopes. Features were extracted from STFT spectrogram images of the gathered sound, then used to train and test an autoencoder model. The reconstruction errors of the autoencoder were compared to distinguish the abnormal status from normal one.

Diagnosing and predicting the wear or degradation status of critical machine components or parts are therefore of general interest. To tackle this challenge, data-driven approaches based on supervised machine learning principles have demonstrated promising results. However, supervised learning models capable of degradation identification require large quantities of data. In practice, run-to-failure data in large amounts is usually not available and expensive to obtain. To overcome this issue, this study proposes an unsupervised learning approach for degradation prognostics of machine tool components and consumables. It uses time series of multi-sensor signal data, which are transformed into a feature representation. The features consist of various characterizations of the time series, allowing to make different signal measurements comparable, and cluster them according to their feature values. The herewith obtained density-based clustering model is used to diagnose and predict the degradation states of components and parts in unknown conditions. The novelty in the proposed approach lies within the identification of continuous component and part degradation states based on unsupervised learning principles. The proposal is verified and demonstrated on an exemplary data set containing a small sample of run-to-failure multi-sensor signals of milling inserts and their corresponding wear state.

An artificial neural network determines whether the network works well. An important part of this work is data preprocessing. This is done using quantization, data alignment, reducing the number of inputs, and other preprocessing techniques to create a new version of the dataset to improve accuracy. The obtained data makes it possible to perform a number of experiments and to find out what approach to data preprocessing shows the best results. The results were evaluated based on two datasets. The first dataset contains diagnostic data of a well-functioning network, and the second one consists of data in which network problems were detected. The highest accuracy obtained in this work is a 98.91% rate of recognizing problems in the network and an accuracy of 87.70% when the network is working well.

Four classification models for the defect-free and defect samples are established as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Random Forest, and their performance is evaluated by a tenfold cross-validation method.

Ample studies are being undertaken for modeling the mechanical characteristics of FDM by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Even in use of amorphous materials, FDM creates anisotropic structures effected by the chosen manufacturing parameters. In order to investigate these process-related characteristics and tailored properties of FDM structures, we prepare FDM-printed poly(ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG) samples with different process parameters. Mechanical and optical characterizations are carried out. We develop 2D-digital-image-correlation code with machine learning algorithm, namely K-means cluster, to analyze microstructures (contact surfaces, the changes in fiber shapes) and calculate porosity. By incorporating these characteristics, we draw CAD images. A digital twin of mechanical laboratory tests are realized by the FEM. We use computational homogenization approach for obtaining the effective properties of the FDM-related anisotropic structure. These simulations are validated by experimental characterizations. In this regard, a systematic methodology is presented for acquiring the anisotropy from the process related inner substructure (microscale) to the material response at the homogenized length scale (macroscale). We found out that the layer thickness and overlap ratio parameters significantly alter the microstructures and thereby, stiffness of the macroscale properties.

However, the materials manufactured using AM perform well below their traditionally manufactured counterparts, particularly for creep and fatigue. Research has shown that this difference in performance is due to the complex relationships between AM process parameters which affect the material microstructure and consequently the mechanical performance as well. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of different AM build parameters on the mechanical performance of parts. Machine learning (ML) models are able to find hidden relationships in data using iterative statistical analyses and have the potential to develop process–structure–property–performance relationships for manufacturing processes, including AM. The aim of this work is to apply ML techniques to materials testing data in order to understand the effect of AM process parameters on the creep rate of additively built nickel-based superalloy and to predict the creep rate of the material from these process parameters. In this work, the predictive capabilities of ML and its ability to develop process–structure–property relationships are applied to the creep properties of laser powder bed fused alloy 718. The input data for the ML model included the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) build parameters used—build orientation, scan strategy and number of lasers—and geometrical material descriptors which were extracted from optical microscope porosity images using image analysis techniques. The ML model was used to predict the minimum creep rate of the Laser Powder Bed Fused alloy 718 samples, which had been creep tested at $$650\,^\circ $$ 650 ∘ C and 600 MPa. The ML model was also used to identify the most relevant material descriptors affecting the minimum creep rate of the material (determined by using an ensemble feature importance framework). The creep rate was accurately predicted with a percentage error of $$1.40\%$$ 1.40 % in the best case. The most important material descriptors were found to be part density, number of pores, build orientation and scan strategy. These findings show the applicability and potential of using ML to determine and predict the mechanical properties of materials fabricated via different manufacturing processes, and to find process–structure–property relationships in AM. This increases the readiness of AM for use in critical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-021-01785-0,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The shopbots were proposed in Industry 4.0 where the more focus was on process automation. In this research work, we propose recommender system for industry 5.0 which is based on collaboration of human beings and machines with more focus on user’s personalization. Recommender system can be considered as an information filtering tool that provides suggestions to users about products, music, friend, topic, etc. This suggestion is based on the interest of users. Several research works have been carried out to improve recommendation accuracy by using matrix factorization, trust-based, hybrid-based, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, very few existing works have leveraged textual opinions for the recommendation to the best of our knowledge. Existing research works have focused only on numerical ratings, which do not reflect actual user behaviour. In this research work, sentiments of textual opinions are analysed for an in-depth analysis of user’s behaviour. Recommendation accuracy is improved by using the proposed score Recop which is calculated from opinion sentiments. Furthermore, the sparsity issue is resolved by using our proposed approach. Amazon and Yelp review datasets are used for Experiment analysis. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are improved significantly using the proposed approach compared to the existing approaches.

An intruder might pose several security problems since the data are transferred across a public network. Although there have been substantial efforts to solve security problems in the IIoT, the majority of them have relied on traditional methods. A wide range of privacy issues (secrecy, authenticity, and access control) must be addressed to protect IIoT systems against attack. Owing to the unique characteristics of IIoT nodes, existing solutions do not properly address the entire security range of IIoT networks. To deal with this, a chaos-based triple layer vector-valued neural network (TLVVNN) is proposed in this paper.

Fault degradation processes are, in general, slowly varying and can be modeled by autoregressive models. However, industrial processes always show typical nonstationary nature, which may bring two challenges: how to capture fault degradation information and how to model nonstationary processes. To address the critical issues, a novel fault degradation modeling and online fault prognostic strategy is developed in this paper. First, a fault degradation-oriented slow feature analysis (FDSFA) algorithm is proposed to extract fault degradation directions along which candidate fault degradation features are extracted. The trend ability assessment is then applied to select major fault degradation features. Second, a key fault degradation factor (KFDF) is calculated to characterize the fault degradation tendency by combining major fault degradation features and their stability weighting factors. After that, a time-varying regression model with temporal smoothness regularization is established considering nonstationary characteristics. On the basis of updating strategy, an online fault prognostic model is further developed by analyzing and modeling the prediction errors. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated with a real industrial process. 故障退化预测是预估过程劣化和故障发生的时间, 已被认为是维护策略中的一个关键组成部分。故障退化过程通常是缓慢变化的, 可以用自回归模型来建模。然而, 工业过程往往表现出典型的非平稳特性, 这就给故障退化信息的获取和非平稳过程的建模带来了挑战。针对上述问题, 本文提出了一种新的故障退化建模和在线故障预测策略。首先, 提出一种面向故障退化的慢特征分析(FDSFA)算法提取故障退化方向, 并沿该方向提取候选故障退化特征。然后, 利用趋势评估算法来选择主要的故障退化特征。其次, 结合主要的故障退化特征及其稳定性加权因子, 计算关键故障退化因子来表征故障退化趋势。针对过程非平稳特性, 建立了带时序平滑正则项的时变回归模型。在更新策略的基础上, 通过对预测误差的分析和建模, 进一步建立了在线故障预测模型。最后, 通过一个实际的工业案例验证了所提方法的预测性能。",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11771-021-4848-x,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

When it comes to the international maritime transport sector, coordinated port state control efforts have been a powerful tool against substandard shipping practices, and this paper intends to set the framework for introducing such control system in the industrial fishing sector. Such control, via inspection regime, will be feasible once the International Maritime Organisation Cape Town Agreement of 2012 enters into force, provided that transparent data is made available by all stakeholders, firstly at the level of countries which are members of Paris Memorandum of understanding and probably when most members are parties to the relevant conventions. Automatic identification system data helped to determine the inspection effort and leads to conclude that this will likely be concentrated in time and in a limited number of ports. We examined the current risk profile after a consultation with stakeholders and concluded that it is not adequate for industrial fishing vessels.

Tool wear during machining has a great impact on the important performance indicators of CNC machine tools, such as machining accuracy, machining efficiency and reliability. Tool wear monitoring is of great significance to improve the machining efficiency, machining accuracy and reliability of CNC machine tools. Multidomain features (time domain, frequency domain and time–frequency domain) can accurately characterise the degree of tool wear. However, manual feature fusion is time consuming and prevents the improvement of monitoring accuracy. A new tool wear prediction method based on multidomain feature fusion by attention-based depth-wise separable convolutional neural network is proposed to solve these problems. In this method, multidomain features of cutting force and vibration signals are extracted and recombined into feature tensors. The proposed hypercomplex position encoding and high-dimensional self-attention mechanism are used to calculate the new representation of input feature tensor, which emphasizes the tool wear sensitive information and suppresses large area background noise. The designed depth-wise separable convolutional neural network is used to adaptively extract high-level features that can characterise tool wear from the new representation, and the tool wear is predicted automatically. The proposed method is verified on three sets of tool run-to-failure data sets of three-flute ball nose cemented carbide tool in machining centre. Experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is remarkably higher than other state-of-art methods.

However, due to the shortness of computation ablility and batery capacity, it is challenging for IIoT devices to process latency-sensitive and resource-sensitive tasks. Moblie Edge Computing (MEC), as a promising paradigm for handling tasks with high quality of service (QoS) requirement and for energy-constrained IIoT devices, allows IIoT devices to offload their tasks to MEC servers, which can significantly reduce the task process delay and energy consumptions. However, the deployment of the MEC servers rely heavily on communication infrastructure, which greatly reduce the flexibility. Toward this end, in this paper, we consider multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) eqqipped with transceivers as aerial MEC servers to provide IIoT devices computation offloading opportunities due to their high controbility. IIoT devices can choose to offload the tasks to UAVs through air-ground links, or to offload the tasks to the remote cloud center through ground cellular network, or to process the tasks locally. We formulate the multi-UAV-Enabled computation offloading problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and prove its NP-hardness. To obtain the energy-efficient and low complexity solution, we propose an intelligent computation offloading algorithm called multi-agent deep Q-learning with stochastic prioritized replay (MDSPR).

The effectiveness of the cooling system significantly affects the production efficiency and part quality, where it is limited by the conventional cooling channels manufactured by the drilling and casting process. Although the maturing advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technology allows the design and fabrication of complex conformal cooling channels, the temperature variance caused by non-uniform thickness distribution of the part remains unsolved. This issue is caused by the fact that the existing conformal cooling designs do not create the channels conformal to the part thickness distributions. In this work, a machine learning aided design method is proposed to generate cooling systems which conform not only to the part surface but also to the part thickness values. Three commonly used conformal cooling channel topologies including spiral, zig-zag, and porous are selected. A surrogate model is derived for each cooling channel topology to approximate the relationship between the design parameters of the cooling channels, part thickness, and the resulting part surface temperature. Based on the surrogate model, the design parameters of each type of cooling channels are optimized to minimize the part surface temperature variation. At the end of the paper, design cases are studied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper aims at developing an abnormal event diagnosis (AED) tool based on ML techniques for monitoring the operation of industrial processes. This tool makes it easier for operators to accomplish their tasks and to make quick and accurate decisions to ensure highly efficient processes. One of the most popular ML techniques for AED is the multivariate statistical control (MSC) method; it only requires the dataset of the normal operating conditions (NOC) to detect and identify the variables that contribute to abnormal events (AEs). Despite the popularity of MSC, it is challenging to select the appropriate method for detecting and isolating all possible abnormalities a complex industrial process can experience. To address this limitation and improve efficiency, we have developed a generic methodology that integrates different ML techniques into a unified multiagent based approach, the selected ML techniques are supposed to be built using only the normal operating condition. For the sake of demonstration, we chose a combination of two ML methods: principal component analysis and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The k-NN was integrated into the proposed multiagent to take into account the nonlinearity and multimodality that frequently occur in industrial processes. In addition, we modified a k-NN method proposed in the literature to reduce computation time during real-time detection and isolation.

Finally, detector network achieves the localization and classification of steel surface defects. The proposed model is evaluated on a typical steel surface defect dataset. Our model achieves 0.805 mAP, 0.144 higher than baseline models, and our model shows high efficiency in inference.

Offering time- or frequency-dependent systemic information provides prognosis with the help of early-warning system using intelligent signal processing systems. Therefore, a chain of data-based information improves the efficiency especially focusing on the determination of remaining useful life of a machine or tool. A broad utilization of sensors in machining processes and artificial intelligence–supported data analysis and signal processing systems are prominent technological tools in the way of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this paper outlines the state of the art of the mentioned systems encountered in the open literature. As a result, existing studies using sensor systems including signal processing facilities in machining processes provide important contribution for error minimization and productivity maximization. However, there is a need for improved adaptive control systems for faster convergence and physical intervention in case of possible problems and failures. On the other hand, sensor fusion is an innovative new technology that makes decisions using multi-sensor information to determine tool status and predict system stability. It is currently not a fully accepted and practiced method. In a nutshell, despite their numerous advantages in terms of efficiency, time saving, and cost, the current situation of sensors used in the industry is not a sufficient level due to the investment cost and its increase with additional signal acquisition hardware and software equipment.

Individual crack profiles were measured for each sample and presented in terms of the total crack length, the maximum crack depth and the median crack width. A linear trend between maximum crack depth and median crack width was observed, where the associated coefficient of determination was sufficiently high ( R ^2 = 0.79). Hence, the crack width is proposed to predict the crack depth. Based on the experimental findings, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through machine learning studies, and a simple relation to predict the internal crack depth from the surface crack width was further developed. Semantic segmentation results proposed an algorithm succeeded in separating enough crack areas to calculate the crack width.

This increase in system dynamics imposes additional flexibility requirements especially on assembly processes, as complexity accumulates in this last step of value creation. Flexible and dynamically interconnected assembly systems can meet the increased requirements as opposed to traditional dedicated assembly line approaches. The high complexity and dynamical environment in these kinds of systems lead to the demand for real-time online control and scheduling solutions. Within the decision-making of online scheduling, the capability of predicting the consequences of available actions is crucial. In real-time environments, running extensive discrete-event simulations to evaluate how actions unfold requires too much computing time. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are a viable alternative to quickly evaluate the potential future performance value of a production state for online production planning and control. They can predict performance indicators such as the expected makespan given the current production status. Leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) game algorithms, an assembly control system based on Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero was created. Specifically, an ANN is incorporated into the approach that suggests favorable job routing decisions and predicts the value of actions. The results show that the trained network can predict favorable actions with an accuracy of over 95% and estimate the makespan with an error smaller than 3%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11740-021-01057-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To address this issue, a fuzzified feedforward neural network (FFNN) approach is proposed in this study. The FFNN approach improves the forecasting precision after generating accurate fuzzy productivity forecasts. In addition, the acceptable range of a fuzzy productivity forecast is specified, based on which the sum of the memberships of actual values is maximized. In this way, the range of productivity can be precisely estimated. After applying the FFNN approach to a real case, the experimental results revealed the superiority of the FFNN approach by improving the forecasting precision, in terms of the hit rate, by 25%. Such an improvement also contributed to a better forecasting accuracy. The superiority of the FFNN approach is in the context that the accuracy of forecasting productivity is optimized only after the range of productivity has been precisely estimated. In contrast, most state-of-the-art methods focus on optimizing the forecasting accuracy, but may be ineffective without information about the range of productivity when future conditions are distinct from the past.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40747-021-00416-8,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The integration provides a new disruptive approach for vertical integration and optimization of the greenhouse production processes to improve energy efficiency, production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability. Applying the Industry 4.0 Digital Twin concept to the Danish horticulture greenhouse industry provides digital models for simulating and evaluating the physical greenhouse facility’s performance. A Digital Twin combines modeling, AI, and Big Data analytics with IoT and traditional sensor data from the production and cloud-based enterprise data to predict how the physical twin will perform under varying operational conditions. The Digital Twins support the co-optimization of the production schedule, energy consumption, and labor cost by considering influential factors, including production deadlines, quality grading, heating, artificial lighting, energy prices (gas and electricity), and weather forecasts. The ecosystem of digital twins extends the state-of-the-art by adopting a scalable distributed approach of “system of systems” that interconnects Digital Twins in a production facility. A collection of specialized Digital Twins are linked together to describe and simulate all aspects of the production chain, such as overall production capacity, energy consumption, delivery dates, and supply processes.

Given the non-deterministic nature of these entities, the generated data streams are susceptible to dynamic and abrupt changes. Such changes, which are formally defined as concept drifts, leads to a decline in the accuracy and robustness of predicted CPS behaviors. Most existing work in concept drift detection are classifier dependent and require labeled data. However, CPS data streams are unlabeled, unstructured and change over time. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for continuous concept drift detection in industrial CPS. This algorithm demonstrates three types of unsupervised learning, online, incremental and decremental. Furthermore, it distinguishes between abrupt and reoccurring drifts. We conducted experiments on SEA, a widely cited synthetic dataset of concept drift detection, and two industrial applications of CPS, task tracking in factory settings and smart energy consumption. The results of these experiments successfully validate the key features of the proposed algorithm and its utility of detecting change in non-deterministic CPS environments.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44163-021-00007-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The interconnectedness of the multiple components that make up real-world manufacturing processes and the typically very large number of variables required to specify procedures and plans within them combine to make it very difficult to map the details of such processes to a formal mathematical representation suitable for conventional optimization methods. Instead, in this work reinforcement learning was applied to produce increasingly efficient plans for material handling in representative manufacturing facilities. Doing so included defining a formal representation of a realistically complex material handling plan, specifying a set of suitable plan change operators as reinforcement learning actions, implementing a simulation-based multi-objective reward function that considers multiple components of material handling costs, and abstracting the many possible material handling plans into a state set small enough to enable reinforcement learning. Experimentation with multiple material handling plans on two separate factory layouts indicated that reinforcement learning could consistently reduce the cost of material handling. This work demonstrates the applicability of reinforcement learning with a multi-objective reward function to realistically complex material handling processes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44163-021-00003-3,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The research on the innovation ability of industrial clusters can not only maintain sustainable development of industrial clusters and obtain sustained competitive advantages, but also provide reference for the government's policy formulation of industrial clusters. This paper aims to study the evaluation of regional industrial clusters' innovation capability based on particle swarm clustering and multi-objective optimization. This paper uses the theory of industrial cluster innovation and takes regional industrial system as the empirical research object to establish a regional industrial system capability evaluation system, which is based on the selection of indicators, combined with analytic hierarchy process and factor analysis to evaluate industrial innovation capability. On this basis, the particle swarm clustering theory is used to verify the innovation ability and evaluation index system of industrial clusters, and provide a reference for the evaluation of the innovation ability of industrial clusters. This paper divides the regional cluster innovation capability into four aspects: innovation input capability, environment support capability, self-development capability and innovation output capability, and systematically analyzes the key elements and in the composition of innovation elements and their relationships. It then constructs the evaluation index system of regional cluster innovation capability. At the same time, this paper introduces clustering analysis algorithm and swarm intelligence algorithm into regional innovation evaluation, combines particle swarm optimization algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm, and optimizes particle swarm clustering algorithm by adjusting adaptive parameters and adding fitness variance. The experimental results of this paper show that from the results of the tested innovation potential of the three industrial clusters, industrial cluster F has the strongest innovation ability, with an evaluation coefficient of 0.851, followed by industrial cluster F, which has a value of 0.623. This result is consistent with the actual innovation status of the selected industry. From this point of view, the established particle swarm clustering model for evaluating the innovation capability of regional industrial clusters is reliable and can be used to evaluate the innovation capability of different industrial clusters.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40747-021-00521-8,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

During the fabrication process, the protective films of the prepregs or other materials used in the process could get inside as a foreign object between the layers. The present method of finding the inclusions during the prepreg layup is by visual inspection in the cleanroom. Carrying out visual inspection is challenging as the layup is usually carried out on large surfaces and reflective by nature. This paper proposes a 3D laser scanner-based approach for the detection of inclusion on flat and curved surfaces. Using the portable laser scanner, the surfaces of each layer are scanned and compared the resulting point clouds using with a reference layer data. Thicknesses between two surfaces are computed with Cloud to Cloud, Mesh to Cloud and Hausdorff distance to enhance the visibility of inclusions. It was found that this approach could enhance the visibility of inclusions over 50 micron and above. These enhanced features are used to train a multiview convolutional neural network to mark the inclusion regions, which can aid the inspector to identify the inclusion regions in a fast and efficient way.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00138-021-01241-2,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Based on field experience, we introduce ROSI, a new robotic device designed for long-term operations in harsh outdoor environments. The mobile robot has a hybrid locomotion system, using wheels to reduce energy consumption while covering long distances, and also flippers with tracks to improve mobility during obstacle negotiation. A mechanical passive switch allows decoupling tracks’ traction, reducing components wear and energy consumption without raising mechanical complexity. Aiming the robot-assisted operation, control strategies help to (i) command both the mobile platform and a robotic manipulator considering the system whole-body model, (ii) adjust the contact force for touching the conveyor structure during vibration inspection, and (iii) climb stairs while automatically adjusting the flippers. Machine Learning algorithms detect conveyors’ dirt build-ups, roller failures, and bearing faults by processing visual, thermal and sound data as inspection functionalities. The algorithms training and validation use a dataset collected from running conveyors at Vale, presenting detection accuracy superior to 90%.

Purpose To motivate industrial practitioners for developing a machine degradation data acquisition system and employ deep learning model training algorithms for machinery health management thus fit themselves into an Industry 4.0 era. Methods The review show-up the recent research works focused on the implementation of deep learning algorithms for developing an intelligent predictive maintenance model for future industries. First, to address the most popularly used deep learning architectures and their significance in machinery health prognostics.

Results The mandate to have large-size machinery failure data for training deep learning algorithm can be regarded as a major limitation. Hyper-parameter optimization, architecture design, and data training of deep learning algorithms are still challenging and unpredictable, which can pull back industrialists from implementing intelligent health management of industrial machinery.

Previous literature on biorefinery resource allocation uses a mainly nonlinear programming approach that assumes steady state for all parameters during simulation; this may result in a delay of response time due to the time taken during the optimization stage. In this paper, a resource allocation system based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed for the biorefinery. The input nodes of the DNN are the parameters that undergo fluctuations while the output nodes are the flowrate allocation of biomass to different chemical and energy conversion pathways. The connection weights and topology of the DNN are optimized using the neuro-differential evolution (NDE) algorithm. The optimization results of the DNN yields an average optimality of 97.7% and reduces the response time by 99.5% as compared to the conventional nonlinear solver. The proposed DNN-NDE framework accounts for both responsiveness and cost performance during the synthesis of a smart resource allocation system.

The powder packing behavior and flowability significantly influence the defect density of as-built parts and, eventually, affect their reliability and mechanical performance. The experimental characterization methods of powder flowability, for example, Hausner ratio, Carr index, and angle of repose, are rather time-consuming and cost-inefficient. Here, we show a rapid-deployed, low-cost, and reliable computer vision approach to evaluate powder flowability based on scanning electron microscopy images. We have trained seven machine learning models using 2,212 SEM images from 16 types of commonly used plasma-atomized metal powders in AM. Our results indicate that the vector of locally aggregated descriptors model with speedup robust features performs best among the models, represented by about 12 ± 7%. Mean absolute percentage error value is lower than traditional convolutional neural network model. The image analysis model can be implemented without a powerful computing system. The performance of such model is robust to the changes of image brightness. This study also demonstrates that our model can successfully predict the flowability of metal powder that does not exist in the original dataset.

To reduce time and cost of object detection application, a method of image dataset creation and networks improvement based on CAD model and edge extraction operators is proposed. It can quickly generate effective training dataset without any tedious work and make the object detection networks obtain good detection performance. The method consists of three steps: capture-images-automatically, cut-and-paste and networks-improvement. To improve the performance of the detection networks, edge extraction operators are used to obtain the common features of the synthetic images and the real images. These edge extraction operators include Sobel edge, Laplacian edge, Canny edge and adaptive threshold edge, and the experimental results show that the adaptive threshold edge achieves the best effect. In addition, a class-weights is adopted to improve the AP of hard-to-detect parts. Ten mechanical parts of a 3D-printed aero-engine are used to evaluate this method. The results show that the improved networks (yolov5s) trained with the synthetic images can achieve 99.08%, 93.83% and 98.91% of the average recall, average precision and mAP, respectively.

The problem of integration and seamless operation introduces IIoT as a separate field of study in smart manufacturing that brings many challenges, including security, traceability, trust, and reliability. In IIoT, many devices will be connected using wireless and internet infrastructure to communicate with each other. In such a scenario, the IIoT devices' trustworthiness becomes an essential factor in avoiding injection by malicious machines. Therefore, an intelligent computational model is needed to cluster and classify the IIoT devices' trustworthiness accurately. In this paper, we present a trust model based on the neutrosophic weighted product method (WPM) used by IIoT applications to assess IIoT devices' trust score. The developed model assesses devices' trustworthiness based on the spatial knowledge, temporal experience, and behavioural pattern retrieved from the IIoT devices. Furthermore, the model proposes neutrosophic K-NN clustering and neutrosophic support vector machines (SVM) for classifying the extracted characteristics. The proposed neutrosophic SVM method is able to correctly identify the trust boundaries and produces the final trust score.

The characteristics of randomization and selection of the best or near-optimal solution of metaheuristic algorithm provide an effective and robust solution; therefore, it has always been used in training of ANN to improve and overcome the above problems.

At standard frequencies of signal digitization of 600–2400 Hz, it is difficult to provide accurate determination of signal parameters during an interval amounting to fractions of an industrial frequency period. This paper demonstrates that this can be aided by neural-network algorithms and artificial feedforward neural networks of direct propagation with simple structure. In the case of adequate training and testing of such a neural network, it allows signal parameters to be recovered in fractions of the main frequency period of 50 Hz. It is demonstrated that trained neural network can be used in a regular microcontroller. The algorithm is analyzed using the example of recovery of a fundamental frequency signal upon nonlinear distortions, when the level of the second harmonics exceeds half of the amplitude of the fundamental frequency signal. Estimation errors of recovery of signal amplitude, phase, and frequency are given. It is demonstrated that recovery can be carried out in a sliding window with the duration from units of milliseconds.

An algorithm of stream data analysis further differentiates the actions for assembly from the background and corrects misclassifications based on the temporal relationship of the actions in assembly. Compared to the CNN classifier directly built with the skeletal data, the proposed system improves the accuracy of action recognition by 28%, reaching 94% accuracy on the tested group of new workers.

Synthetic data generation and data augmentation are the typical means to compensate for the scarcity of labeled training data.

Though this holds true in niche markets, the economic viability of additive manufacturing for large-scale industrial production is still in question. Companies often struggle to justify their investment in additive manufacturing due to challenges in the integration of such technologies into mainstream production. First, most additive technologies exhibit a relatively low production rate when compared with traditional production processes. Second, there is a lack of robust design for additive manufacturing methods and tools that enable the leveraging of the attendant unique capabilities, including the ability to form organic part geometries and automated part consolidations. Third, there is a dearth of systematic part screening methods to evaluate manufacturability in additive manufacturing. To tackle the challenge of manufacturability evaluation, the present work proposes a novel approach derived from latent semantic analysis and dimensional analysis to evaluate parts and their production for a variety of selected metrics. The selected metrics serve as descriptors of design features and manufacturing functions, which are developed using functional modeling and dimensional analysis theory. Singular-value decomposition and Euclidean distance measurement techniques are used to determine the relative manufacturability for a set of parts for a specified manufacturing process technology. The utility of the method is demonstrated for laser powder bed fusion technology.

A data acquisition and processing methodology has been set up to enable efficient management of the hyperspectral data. The hyperspectral images obtained from the process were labeled with the surface roughness R_z as determined by a confocal microscope. The data was used to train a convolutional neural network whose hyperparameters were optimized in a hyperparameter tuning process. The resulting network was able to predict the surface roughness within a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.1 μm over samples from three different parameter sets. Since this is significantly smaller than the spread of the actual roughness measured (MAE = 14.3 μm), it indicates that the network identified features in the hyperspectral data linking to the roughness. These results provide the basis for future research aiming to link hyperspectral process images to further part properties relevant for quality assurance.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-021-07274-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this regard, a combined analysis of the concept of new industrial development and the concept of sustainable development, as well as an assessment of the current practice of their implementation is required. In this paper, such an analysis was carried out on the example of water resources management. The paper proposes a methodology for assessing the correlation of water management and industrial development levels of regions. This includes the use of both traditional statistical approaches to the analysis of the level of development of economic systems, and elements of data mining. The neural network is constructed in order to estimate the forecasted values of the water intensity of the gross regional product when the indicators of the level of industrial development of the regions change. The results show that the most significant indicators for changing water intensity include advanced production technologies used, the share of value-added to high-tech industries, and innovative activities of organisations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11269-021-02889-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Mold manufacturing is a typical make-to-order system. The characteristics of new products (molds or products produced using molds) determine the process and resource plan for mold manufacturing. Therefore, it is essential to store and inherit knowledge regarding products or mold design and process planning. In this study, we extract product features from images of products. We measure the similarity between features of new products and those of products previously manufactured. The clustering method is used to search for similar processes and resources among previously manufactured products. Moreover, design characteristics such as mold type, structure, and size, obtained from design data, are used to support this search for similar processes and resources. Herein, we propose a framework for a similarity retrieval model based on results of the product and design feature extraction. Convolutional neural networks and an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm are used to derive similar processes. Furthermore, we propose a semiautomatic procedure to construct a collaborative process model that includes product, process, and resource information.

A device fingerprint consists of the TCP/IP header features and port-based features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are collected by a hybrid mechanism which has a negligible impact on device functionality and can avoid the problem of the long TCP connection. Once the fingerprint of a device is generated, it will be fed to the classifiers based on Gradient Boosting to predict its type details. Based on our proposed method, we implement a prototype application called IIoT Device Type Fingerprinting (IDTF) which capable of automatically identifying the types of devices being connected to an IIoT network. We collect a dataset consisting of 19,174 fingerprints from real-world Internet-facing IIoT devices indexed by Shodan to train and evaluate the classifiers using ten-fold cross-validation. And we conduct comparative experiments in an IIoT testbed to compare the effectiveness of IDTF with two famous fingerprinting tools. The experimental result shows that the ability of our approach is confirmed by a high mean F-Measure of 95.76%. It also demonstrates that IDTF achieves the highest identification rate in the testbed and is non-intrusive for IIoT devices.

The high scale of physical inactiveness with inadequate activities such as drinking alcohol, smoking and negligence of healthy diet causes extreme health issues. Therefore, it becomes essential to recognize health, behavioral, and environmental irregularities to determine the scale of health severity for the individuals having sedentary behavior. Conspicuously, in the proposed study, an e-healthcare framework has been proposed by utilizing the advantages of Internet of Things (IoT) and fog technology to determine the irregularities related to health, behavioral, physical posture, and environmental conditions of the individual. In the initial stage of data processing, the weighted K-mean clustering technique is used to identify the irregularities at the fog layer that helps to maintain the sensitivity of the healthcare domain. Furthermore, Weighted K-mean Clustering technique-Artificial Neural Network assisted (WKMC-ANN) hybrid methodology is proposed on the cloud layer for the early prediction of health severity. Adding a multi-stage decision-making mechanism also helps to optimize the assistive resource distribution. To determine the performance of irregularity determination, a total of 15 individuals by the age of 32–45 years are continuously monitored by deploying the framework for 30 days in an indoor environment.

Thus, it is vital for achieving the highest maturity level of SM technologies. In context, digital twin (DT) is an advanced virtual factory with simulation as its core technical functionality. However, the requirement of several inputs limits the implementation of DT on a physical asset without user intervention. Moreover, surpassing this limitation requires extraction methods for deriving the necessary inputs for DT application. Therefore, this study proposes information fusion and systematic logic library (SLL)-generation methods to facilitate the self-configuration of an autonomous DT. The information fusion aggregates and extracts the information elements required for DT application from heterogeneous information sources. In addition, the SLL generation method created the SLL required for reflecting the functional units of agents within the physical asset. Both methods were proposed from available SM standards such as ISA-95, automation markup language, and OPC unified architecture. Furthermore, an autonomous DT-supporting framework was designed by analyzing the relationship between asset description and SM standards, which facilitated the artificial intelligence-based extraction of the asset description object and SLL. Additionally, the core functional engines within this framework were designed using machine learning and process-mining techniques. Consequently, the proposed methods reduced the input pre-processing time required for constructing and synchronizing an autonomous DT to aid the application of autonomous DT on the physical asset without user intervention.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-021-01795-y,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, applying an appropriate prediction of corrosion process for the manufactured metals or alloys trigger an extended life of the product. At present, the current prediction models for additive manufactured alloys are either complicated or built on a restricted basis towards corrosion depletion. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the corrosion rate and corrosion potential prediction by considering significant major parameters such as solution time, aging time, aging temperature, and corrosion test time. The Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), which is an additive manufacturing process used in the manufacturing of health care equipment, was investigated in the present research. All the accumulated information used to manufacture the LENS-based Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloy was considered from previous literature. They enabled to create a robust Bayesian Regularization (BR)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict with accuracy the material best corrosion properties.

Here, we employ high-speed nanoindentation mapping, electron probe microanalysis, and electron backscatter diffraction to characterize as-deposited and heat-treated Ti–6Al–2Zr–Mo–V alloys. Our results show the correlations between mechanical contrasts (hardness and elastic modulus ) and phase contrasts (α and β). The hardness and elastic modulus of the α and β phases are increased due to the element redistribution after annealing (Al diffuses from β to α; Mo and V diffuse from α to β). We use a K-means clustering algorithm to analyze the nanoindentation dataset and correlate the mechanical property maps to the distribution of α and β phases.

One useful way to get insights for consumer behavior is by estimating and studying the price elasticity in different choice situations.

The approach leverages the automatic differentiation capabilities of deep learning libraries. We test our approach on data extracted from a global distribution system (GDS) on European market data. The results show clear differences in price elasticity between leisure and business trips. Overall, the demand for trips is price elastic for leisure and inelastic for the business segment. Moreover, the approach is flexible enough to study elasticity on different dimensions, showing that the demand for business trips could become highly elastic in some contexts like departures during weekends, international destinations, or when the reservation is done with enough anticipation.

To obtain high-quality products by using DED, it is necessary to understand the influence of the process parameters on the product quality. The optimization of such processing parameters provides several advantages such as minimization of the loss of material and time. However, the optimization of the complex relationship between the process parameters-geometry-properties of the fabricated sample is difficult to realize and requires significant experimentation. Herein, a computational model based on artificial neural networks was developed to optimize process parameters for DED-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The model was developed to estimate the density and build height (the actual build height realized after fabrication) of the sample as a function of power, scan speed, powder feed rate, and layer thickness. The optimum model with high-accuracy predictions was employed to construct the process maps for the DED-processed Ti-6Al-4V. The relative importance indices of process parameters on the build height and density were investigated. Further, the effect of power and scan speed on the microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was discussed. Finally, based on the obtained results, the optimum fabrication conditions for the DED-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy were determined.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-021-07115-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For this reason, an artificial intelligence-based tool with parallel search, document creation, and data integrity review capabilities is being investigated as a potential solution. This paper describes a proof of concept project to develop an AI-based tool to rapidly assemble an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) briefing document for a potential medicine. We have called the tool an Intelligent Machine for Document Preparation or IMDP. Methods A training corpus of approximately 65,000 pdf documents derived from electronic lab notebooks and technical reports related to five molecules (including Merestinib) was ingested, and prior EOP2 documents from the remaining four molecules was used to generate training questions and answers. Then, an annotation-light natural language processing algorithm analyzed a set of structured and unstructured data regarding Merestinib. A simple user interface was created allowing scientists to query the system in natural language, and a table builder, image/plot finder, and free-text addition features were added to allow for advanced search without dependence on keywords. Results Three significant innovations were designed-in to improve overall performance as compared to our benchmark solution without sacrificing usability. First, the AI-based IMDP was built to improve accuracy and accelerate document creation with remarkably low amount of training. Second, image search capability was added to enrich the knowledge base, and third, the IMDP was integrated with the existing process rather than adding a step in the workflow. Finally, accuracy and total document creation time were compared with the existing tool (benchmark tool). Our experiments show that the AI-based technology reached 89% accuracy which surpassed the internal benchmark of 54% and retrieved the right information 3.6 times faster.

This paper describes a process to evaluate four well-performing deep convolutional neural network models (Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeepLab V3+, and IC-Net) for use in such a process. A custom-captured dataset of images showing fiber cut-pieces with geometrical defects was annotated and augmented for training deep convolutional neural network models; results show acceptable detection accuracy for gripper and fabric based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.92 and 0.86, respectively. However, wrinkle detection initially achieves a significantly lower IoU score of 0.40 in the best case. This discrepancy is mainly due to geometrical ambiguities, as wrinkles do not have a clearly defined boundary and are hard to distinguish even for human eye. The model is then evaluated as a binary predictor based on per-component detection success; the model achieves a recall rate (i.e., the ratio of the wrinkles detected to all existing wrinkles) of 0.71 and a precision score (i.e., the ratio of those detected being actually wrinkles) of 0.76. From a practical point of view, this model can outperform a human operator based on the results presented. Two complementary approaches are also introduced for the detection of wrinkles at the early stages of formation as well as the completely formed wrinkles. The developed method can be readily used in a variety of composite manufacturing processes or adapted to other similar tasks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-021-01776-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

For example, complex parts can be manufactured without tools. For metals, the most commonly used AM process is laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF). The L-PBF process is prone to process disturbances, hence maintaining a consistent part quality remains an important subject within current research. An established indicator for quantifying process changes is the dimension of melt pools, which depends on the energy input and the cooling conditions. The melt pool geometry is normally measured manually in cross sections of solidified welding seams. This paper introduces a new approach for the automated visual measuring of melt pools in cross-sections of parts manufactured by L-PBF. The melt pools are first segmented in the images and are then measured. Since the melt pools have a heterogeneous appearance, segmentation with common digital image processing is difficult, deep learning was applied in this project. With the presented approach, the melt pools can be measured over the whole cross section of the specimen. Furthermore, remelted melt pools, which are only partly visible, are evaluated. With this automated approach, a high number of melt pools in each cross-section can be measured, which allows the examination of trends over the build direction in a specimen and results in better statistics. Furthermore, deviations in the energy input can be estimated via the measured melt pool dimensions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40964-021-00173-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, detailed analysis of data accumulated from different sensors in production and assembly manufacturing lines is necessary to minimize faulty products and understand the production process. Additionally, when selecting analytical methods, manufacturing companies must select the most suitable techniques. This paper presents a data analytics approach to extract useful information, such as important measurements for the dimensions of a shim, a small part for aligning shafts, from the manufacturing data of a power transfer unit (PTU). This paper also identifies the best techniques and analytical approaches within the following six individual areas: (1) identifying measurements associated with faults; (2) identifying measurements associated with shim dimensions; (3) identifying associations between station codes; (4) predicting shim dimensions; (5) identifying duplicate samples in faulty data; and (6) identifying error distributions associated with measurement. These areas are analysed in accordance with two analytical approaches: (a) statistical analysis and (b) machine learning (ML)-based analysis. The results show (a) the relative importance of measurements with regard to the faulty unit and shim dimensions, (b) the error distribution of measurements, and (c) the reproduction rate of faulty units. Additionally, both statistical analysis and ML-based analysis have shown that the measurement ‘PTU housing measurement’ is the most important measurement among available shim dimensions. Additionally, certain faulty stations correlated with one another. ML is shown to be the most suitable technique in three areas (e.g. identifying measurements associated with faults), while statistical analysis is sufficient for the other three areas (e.g. identifying measurements associated with shim dimensions) because they do not require a complex analytical model. This study provides a clearer understanding of assembly line production and identifies highly correlated and significant measurements of a faulty unit.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-021-06979-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Considering the various uncertain factors that interfere with accurate payload positioning in water, neural networks are designed to compensate for unknown parameters and unmodeled dynamics in the formulated problem. The neural network-based estimators are embedded in the anti-sway control algorithm, which improves the control performance against uncertainties. A sliding mode control with an exponential reaching law is developed to suppress the sway motions during underwater transportation. The asymptotic stability of the sliding manifold is proved via Lyapunov analysis. The embedded estimator prevents the conservative gain selection of the sliding mode control, thus reducing the chattering phenomena.

The setup and workflow presented here are designed to mimic the characteristics of real manufacturing processes and proves that Deep Reinforcement Learning can be applied to physical systems built from industrial drive and control components by transferring policies learned in simulation to the real machine. Aided by domain randomization, training in a virtual environment is crucial due to the benefit of accelerated training speed and the desire for safe Reinforcement Learning. Our key contribution is to demonstrate the applicability of simulation-based Deep Reinforcement Learning in industrial automation technology. We introduce an industrial drive and control system, based on the classic pub game Foosball, from both an engineering and a simulation perspective, describing the strategies applied to increase transfer robustness. Our approach allowed us to train a self-learning agent to independently learn successful control policies for demanding Foosball tasks based on sparse reward signals.

Results To answer the former question, we utilized 6 months of state employment level data from California, United States, as a method of gauging the economic health of agency-regulated industries. We implemented a machine learning model to predict weekly employment data and a t -test to indicate any significant changes in employment. We found that, following California's state-issued stay-at-home order and the agency’s regulation suspension, oil and certain manufacturing industries had statistically significant lower employment values. To answer the latter question, we used 10 years of PM_2.5 levels in California, United States, as a metric for local air quality and treatment–control county pairs to isolate the impact of regulation rollbacks from the impacts of the state lockdown. Using the agency’s data, we performed a t -test to determine whether treatment–control county pairs experienced a significant change in PM_2.5 levels. Even with the statewide lockdown—a measure we hypothesized would correlate with decreased mobility and pollution levels—in place, counties with oil refineries experienced the same air pollution levels when compared to historical data averaged from the years 2009 to 2019. Conclusions In contrast to the expectation that the suspension would improve the financial health of the oil and manufacturing industry, we can conclude that these industries are not witnessing economic growth with the suspension and state shutdown in place. Additionally, counties with oil refineries could be taking advantage of these rollbacks to continue emitting the same amount of PM_2.5, in spite of state lockdowns. For these reasons, we ask international policymakers to reconsider the suspension of enforcement regulations as these actions do not fulfill their initial expectations. We recommend the creation and maintenance of pollution control and prevention programs that develop emission baselines, mandate the construction of pollution databases, and update records of pollution emissions.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12302-021-00489-9,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many approaches for identifying invariants attempt to do so automatically, typically using data logs, but these can miss valid system properties if relevant behaviours are not well-represented in the data. Furthermore, as the CPS is already built, resolving any design flaws or weak points identified through this process is costly. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants from an analysis of a CPS design , based on principles of the axiomatic design methodology from design science. Our method iteratively decomposes a high-level CPS design to identify sets of dependent design parameters (i.e. sensors and actuators), allowing for invariants and invariant checkers to be derived in parallel to the implementation of the system. We apply our method to the designs of two CPS testbeds, SWaT and WADI, deriving a suite of invariant checkers that are able to detect a variety of single- and multi-stage attacks without any false positives. Finally, we reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, how it can be complemented by other defence mechanisms, and how it could help engineers to identify and resolve weak points in a design before the controllers of a CPS are implemented.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s42400-021-00069-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Current porosity analysis models use machine setting parameters, such as laser angle and part pose.

To address the first problem, a physics-informed, data-driven model (PIM) is used, which instead of directly using machine setting parameters to predict porosity levels of printed parts, first interprets machine settings into physical effects, such as laser energy density and laser radiation pressure. Then, these physical, machine-independent effects are used to predict porosity levels according to “pass,” “flag,” and “fail” categories instead of focusing on quantitative pore size prediction. With six learning methods’ evaluation, PIM proved to achieve good performances with prediction error of 10 ∼ $\sim $ 26%.

Article,doi:10.1007/s00170-021-06770-8,The creation of a neural network based capability profile to enable generative design and the manufacture of functional FDM parts,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.1007/s00170-021-06770-8,Springer,2021-04-01,"In order to manufacture functional parts using filament deposition modelling (FDM), an understanding of the machine’s capabilities is necessary. Eliciting this understanding poses a significant challenge due to a lack of knowledge relating manufacturing process parameters to mechanical properties of the manufactured part. Prior work has proposed that this could be overcome through the creation of capability profiles for FDM machines. However, such an approach has yet to be implemented and incorporated into the overall design process. Correspondingly, the aim of this paper is two-fold and includes the creation of a comprehensive capability profile for FDM and the implementation of the profile and evaluation of its utility within a generative design methodology. To provide the foundations for the capability profile, this paper first reports an experimental testing programme to characterise the influence of five manufacturing parameters on a part’s ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and tensile modulus (E). This characterisation is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN). This ANN forms the basis of a capability profile that is shown to be able to represent the mechanical properties with RMSEP of 1.95 MPa for UTS and 0.82 GPa for E.

The goal of this paper is to provide context for the application of machine learning to materials processing. The general landscapes of data science and materials processing are presented, using the foundry and the metal casting industry as an exemplar. The challenges that exist with typical foundry data are that the data are unbalanced, semi-supervised, heterogeneous, and limited in sample size.

Use of machine learning is gaining popularity due to its ability to solve non-linear problems with large data sets and little knowledge about relationships between parameters. Such models use relationships between inputs and outputs to make further predictions on unseen data, without requiring any understanding regarding the system, making them highly suited to dealing with the stochastic data sets found in a manufacturing environment. This has been seen in literature for determining electrical energy demand for residential or commercial buildings, rather than manufacturing environments. This study proposes a novel method of coupling simulation with machine learning to predict indoor workshop conditions and building energy demand, in response to production schedules, outdoor conditions, building behaviour and use. Such predictions can subsequently allow for more efficient management of HVAC systems.

The operational efficiency in the competitive industry is ensured by an adequate production control system that manages all operations in order to optimize key performance indicators. Currently, control systems are mostly based on static and model-based heuristics, requiring significant human domain knowledge and, hence, do not match the dynamic environment of manufacturing companies.

This paper addresses the design of RL to create an adaptive production control system by the real-world example of order dispatching in a complex job shop. As RL algorithms are “black box” approaches, they inherently prohibit a comprehensive understanding. Furthermore, the experience with advanced RL algorithms is still limited to single successful applications, which limits the transferability of results.

However, metal cellular structures are difficult to fabricate due to their complex geometries, even with modern additive manufacturing technologies such as the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process. Assessing the manufacturability of metal cellular structures via a DMLS process is a challenging task as the geometric features of the structures are complex. Besides, via a DMLS process, the manufacturability also depends on the cumulative deformation of the layers during the manufacturing process. Existing methods on Design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) provide design guidelines that are based on past successful printed designs. However, they are not effective in predicting the manufacturability of metal cellular structures. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning based manufacturability assessment (SSDLMA) framework to assess whether a metal cellular structure can be successfully manufactured from a given DMLS process. To enable efficient learning, we represent the complex cellular structures as 3D binary arrays with a simple yet efficient voxelisation method. We then train a deep learning based classifier using only a small amount of experimental data by adopting a semi-supervised learning approach. By running real experiments and comparing with existing DFAM methods and machine learning models, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SSDLMA framework.

However, the success of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, hindering the direct applications of big-data based ML tools to metal AM problems. To fully exploit the power of machine learning for metal AM while alleviating the dependence on “big data”, we put forth a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both data and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum, mass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of physics-informed deep learning to three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type approach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function, which can not only exactly enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process. The PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully assess the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available experimental data and high-fidelity simulation results, using finite element based variational multi-scale formulation method. The investigations show that the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM shows the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader applications to advanced manufacturing.

Fuzz testing (fuzzing) for the ICP is a common way to discover whether the ICP itself is designed and implemented with flaws and network security vulnerability. Traditional fuzzing methods promote the safety and security testing of ICPs, and many of them have practical applications. However, most traditional fuzzing methods rely heavily on the specification of ICPs, which makes the test process a costly, time-consuming, troublesome and boring task.

The disadvantages of DBN have been analyzed and improved to create attack detectors in network traffic. The output is combined with Softmax Regression for effective intrusion detection and classification detection. Training and testing of the hybrid DBN model were carried out with the actual and original data set generated by ICS. DBNs are a much-preferred approach for detecting malicious attacks in network traffic. In instances where there is a lot of data, it is important to select the most appropriate structure for the DBN model. Therefore, in the model the hidden layers are updated by contrastive divergence (CD), and the output layer is combined with the Softmax classifier. The proposed model architecture has proved successful in many limitations, such as the complexity and size of training data. The proposed hybrid DBN model provided 99.72% accuracy in intrusion detection and classification. These results showed that the model achieved better performance than the existing intrusion detection system (IDS). It also provided approximately 5% more accuracy improvements with the hybrid model than with older DBN-based systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12652-020-02271-w,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Industry 4.0 is a suite of enabler technologies for such smart ecosystems that allow transformation of industrial processes. When implemented, Industry 4.0 technologies have a huge impact on efficiency, productivity and profitability of businesses. The adoption and implementation of Industry 4.0, however, require to overcome a number of practical challenges, in most cases, due to the lack of modernisation and automation in place with traditional manufacturers. This paper presents a first of its kind case study for moving a traditional food manufacturer, still using the machinery more than one hundred years old, a common occurrence for small- and medium-sized businesses, to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies. The paper reports the challenges we have encountered during the transformation process and in the development stage. The paper also presents a smart production control system that we have developed by utilising AI, machine learning, Internet of things, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing technologies. The system provides novel data collection, information extraction and intelligent monitoring services, enabling improved efficiency and consistency as well as reduced operational cost. The platform has been developed in real-world settings offered by an Innovate UK-funded project and has been integrated into the company’s existing production facilities. In this way, the company has not been required to replace old machinery outright, but rather adapted the existing machinery to an entirely new way of operating. The proposed approach and the lessons outlined can benefit similar food manufacturing industries and other SME industries.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-021-05726-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The just-in-time and just barely good enough documentation may miss out on important executable specifications. Interestingly, the frequently asked ‘how-to-do’ questions on the popular question answering (Q&A) websites like stack overflow are strong indicators of gaps in documentation and respondent answers can complement conventional software documentation practices. Social interaction within these QA websites generates partially structured content commonly referred to as crowd knowledge that can offer a peer-reviewed re-documentation by integrating the answers of these ‘how-to-do’ concerns. But finding the best, value-added answer to the question which can contribute toward an enriched and curated documentation is computationally difficult. Moreover, query duplicates can cause seekers to spend more time finding these best answers. As a solution, the research proffers a novel question-answering crowd documentation model (QACDoc) which is based on a socially mediated documentation mechanics involving the dynamics of community-based web. Firstly, duplicate questions are detected using Siamese neural architecture where two identical hierarchical attention networks are used to generate vectors for similarity matching. Semantic matching is done using Manhattan distance function, and a multi-layer perceptron is trained to output the predictions. Next, all respondents of semantically matched questions are grouped to form an intent-based crowd and lastly, top k -experts are identified using representative social presence features for expert ranking. The crowd documentation is then filtered to only include answers of these identified experts.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00530-020-00741-x,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

With the deployment of massive and faster mobile networks, almost every daily-use item is connected to the Internet. IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is used for the collection and analysis of different types of multimedia data (i.e., images, videos, audios, etc.). This multimedia data is generated by various types of smart devices like drones, robots, smart controller, smart surveillance system which are deployed for the industrial monitoring and control. The multimedia data is generated in the enormous amount which can be considered as the big data. This data is further utilized in various types of business needs for example, chances of fire accidents in the industrial plant, overall machine health, etc., which can be predicted through the application of big data analytics. Therefore, IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is very helpful to the concerned authorities as they come to know the important information in advance. However, all the smart devices are connected and controlled through the Internet. It further causes severe threats to the communication happens in an IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment. It is vulnerable to various types of attacks such as replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, secret information leakage, sensitive information modification, and malware injection (i.e., mirai). Therefore, it is important to prevent the communication of such an environment against the different types of possible attacks. These days, the attacks performed by botnets (i.e., malware attacks such as mirai and reaper) have drawn attention to the researchers. Under the influence of such attacks, the communication of IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment is disrupted. Moreover, the attackers may also control the smart devices remotely and can change their functionalities. Hence, we need some robust mechanism to detect the presence of the malware attacks in such an environment. In this paper, we propose a malware detection mechanism in IoT-enabled industrial multimedia environment with the help of machine-learning approach, which is named as MADP-IIME. MADP-IIME uses four different types of machine learning methods (i.e., naive bayes, logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest) to detect the presence of malware attacks successfully. Furthermore, MADP-IIME performs better than other related existing schemes and achieves $$99.5 \%$$ 99.5 % detection and $$0.5 \%$$ 0.5 % false positive rate. In addition, the conducted security analysis proves the resilience of the proposed MADP-IIME against different types of malware attacks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00530-020-00743-9,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, it is difficult to directly measure the key biological variables using traditional physical sensors during the process of fermentation, which makes the monitoring and real-time control impossible. To resolve this problem, a data-driven soft sensor modeling method based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed in this paper. This method is suitable for large amount of data and it enjoys high efficiency and robustness. At the same time, an adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm is used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the DNN model, which is a technique for efficient stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory requirement. The consistent correlation method is used to determine the auxiliary variables of the soft sensor model. The penicillin and l -lysine fermentation processes are taken as the research object, substrate concentration, cell concentration, and product concentration are selected as a target variable. The performance of established soft sensor model is evaluated through the indexes of mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The simulation results show that the prediction performance of the soft sensor model based on DNN-Adam is good and compared with model based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum optimization algorithm. It is verified that the proposed method can make a more accurate real-time prediction of quality variables in the fermentation process, and it has higher prediction accuracy than DNN-SGD method.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42979-020-00440-4,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this field, leather is a natural product commonly used as a raw material to manufacture luxury objects. To ensure good quality on these products, one of the fundamental processes is the visual inspection phase to identify defects on leather surfaces. A typical exercise in quality control during the production is to perform a rigorous manual inspection on the same piece of leather several times, using different viewing angles and distances. However, the process of the human inspection is expensive, time-consuming, and subjective. In addition, it is always prone to human error and inter-subject variability as it requires a high level of concentration and might lead to labor fatigue.

The ML approaches face barriers since it demands a changing in the production plant mindset to a more digital production and in the organization’s structure for a more advanced data security. The paper aims to propose a smart inconsistency and fail prediction system for manufacturing systems of an automakers supplier assembly process based on the applications of ML techniques.

The trained model was then applied to the assembly line with unobserved data of new products, with its result compared with similar previous productions. The results of the tests showed that the proposed stacking model lessens the possibility of rework in the next stages of assembly and creates a more precise process control for the supervisor.

Advanced cyber-attacks on industrial systems take multiple steps to reach ICS end devices. However, current anomaly detection systems can only detect attacks on individual local devices, and they do not consider the impact or consequences of an individual attack on the rest of the ICS devices. In this paper, we aim to explore how deep learning recurrent neural networks and correlation analysis techniques can be used collaboratively for anomaly detection in an ICS network on the scale of the entire systems. For each detected attack, our presented system-wide anomaly detection method will predict the next step of the attack. We use iTrust SWaT dataset and Power System Attack datasets from MSU national Labs to explore how the addition of correlation analysis to recurrent networks can expand anomaly detection methods to the system-wide scale.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-79150-6_29,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of the IoT related issues and challenges are addressed concerning applications such as smart home, smart office, smart city, smart agriculture, intelligent transportation, etc. But it is rarely addressed in terms of prognostics and health management (PHM) of industrial machinery, which is the heart of the Industry 4.0 revolution. IoT data from sensors and other ubiquitous sources, with the insights gained from Artificial Intelligence (AI), serves to transform current enterprise activities to Industry 4.0 standard. Studying the role of deep learning (DL) in IoT security preservation will be more realistic if we investigate the scope of IoT and AI in ensuring the integrity and security of devices in an industrial environment. For such a background study of IoT application and AI's intervention, this article describes the scenario of integrity and security preservation of rotating machinery, which constitutes around 40% of all the industrial machinery. An Industrial IoT(IIoT) based AI framework is proposed, which details the methods and challenges of data collection with IoT, signal acquisition-related issues in the processing phase, and different techniques and models in deep and shallow learning categories. To understand the root cause of the machinery's structural integrity issues, rotor fault diagnosis (RFD), primarily structural rotor fault (SRF), has been considered for the case study. We mainly focus on discussing the general security issues with the IIoT based on a framework developed with the RFD scenario.

In recent years, energy consumption has increasingly attracted attention in both academia and industry due to the increasing demands and applications of AM systems in production. However, AM systems are considered highly complex, consisting of several subsystems, where energy consumption is related to various correlated factors. These factors stem from different sources and typically contain features with various types and dimensions, posing challenges for integration for analysing and modelling. To tackle this issue, a hybrid machine learning (ML) approach that integrates extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) decision tree and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) technique, is proposed to handle such multi-source data with different granularities and structures for energy consumption prediction. In this paper, four different sources, including design, process, working environment, and material, are taken into account. The unstructured data is clustered by DBSCAN so to reduce data dimensionality and combined with handcrafted features into the XGBoost model for energy consumption prediction.

This is largely due to the benefits that they offer in terms of design freedom, lead-time reduction, mass-customization as well as potential sustainability improvements due to efficiency in resource usage.

To this aim, various sensors, such as pyrometers, photodiodes, and matrix CCD detectors, have been tested. These standard temperature measurements, however, do not provide a comprehensive description of the process dynamics, as they are just limited to surface observations. Furthermore, they are often used for post-factum inspection, i.e., after the piece is partially or even completely produced. No robust and low-cost methods are so far known to monitor the quality of laser processes in real-time. To close this gap, we propose an innovative approach for online quality monitoring of additive manufacturing employing acoustic emissions (AE). In fact, AE signals can provide in-depth information about the process, e.g., melting, resolidification, delamination, and cracking of the workpiece. Moreover, the sintering or melting of the metal powder has several unique acoustic signatures that can be detected and interpreted in terms of quality. In our approach, the correlation of the acoustic signals to the quality of the produced pieces is made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. Specifically, AI in the form of Machine Learning is used to perform a data-driven extraction and recognition of the unique acoustic signatures from different sintering or melting events. In this contribution, we present a summary of our results in the fields of selective laser melting and laser welding, which have similar underlying mechanisms. At first, we discuss how, by using AE, we can classify different types of defects and porosity content in both processes. Afterward, with the aid of high-speed X-ray imaging, we demonstrate the real-time performance of our approach in the classification of transient events/regimes that are critical for the final quality—in particular conduction, stable keyhole, unstable keyhole, pore formation, and blowout. Finally, we present the future possibilities in terms of control of AM processes based on AI.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-54334-1_15,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

New concepts in design and control allow expanding their applications in different fields. The vast amount of data have been collected almost in any domain of interest.

Vibration analysis and vibration monitoring, including how to detect and monitor anomalies in vibration data are widely used techniques for predictive maintenance in high-speed rotating machines. However, accurately identifying the presence of a bearing fault can be challenging in practice, especially when the failure is still at its incipient stage, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the monitored signal is small. The main objective of this work is to design a system that will analyze the vibration signals of a rotating machine, based on recorded data from sensors, in the time/frequency domain. As a consequence of such substantial interest, there has been a dramatic increase of interest in applying Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to this task.

While these systems are robust in automatically localizing suspected defects, human know-how in a secondary assessment and decision-making step remains indispensable to avoid an excess of rejected parts. Rather than changing the existing defect detection system and risking difficult to anticipate changes to a solid evaluation process, we propose the integration of human know-how in a subsequent support system through end-to-end learning. Using XCT data and the corresponding decisions performed by the XCT operator, we aim to support and possibly automate the secondary quality assessment process. In our paper we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to predict both, the final decision of the XCT operator and a defect class indication, for cast parts rejected by the defect detection system based on XCT slice images. On a dataset of 19,459 defect records categorized in 7 classes, we achieved an accuracy of 92% for the decision and 93% for the defect class indication on the testing split. We further show that, by binding decisions to the reliability of the predicted defect class, our model has the potential to enhance also a production process with a near-faultless condition.

Intelligent job batching, as one of the important parts of intelligent production in IIoT, is desired to group jobs with similar features into one batch under the constraint of batch capacity while considering the manufacturing target. This work formulates the job batching problem as a Markov Decision Process and proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to achieve intelligent job batching. The job batching model is based on the pointer network. The convergence of the model under different parameters is analyzed, and the performance of the method is evaluated by comparing it with the manual result, K-means algorithm, and multiple meta-heuristic algorithms via real production data. Experiments show that the proposed method can produce better solution in terms of the feature difference within a batch and the total batch number, especially in large-scale manufacturing scenarios.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-86130-8_38,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Because defective LED chips may be traced back to different causes, a time and cost-intensive electrical and optical contact measurement is employed. Fast photoluminescence measurements, on the other hand, are commonly used to detect wafer separation damages but also hold the potential to enable an efficient detection of all kinds of defective LED chips. On a photoluminescence image, every pixel corresponds to an LED chip’s brightness after photoexcitation, revealing performance information. But due to unevenly distributed brightness values and varying defect patterns, photoluminescence images are not yet employed for a comprehensive defect detection. In this work, we show that fully convolutional networks can be used for chip-wise defect detection, trained on a small data-set of photoluminescence images. Pixel-wise labels allow us to classify each and every chip as defective or not. Being measurement-based, labels are easy to procure and our experiments show that existing discrepancies between training images and labels do not hinder network training. Using weighted loss calculation, we were able to equalize our highly unbalanced class categories. Due to the consistent use of skip connections and residual shortcuts, our network is able to predict a variety of structures, from extensive defect clusters up to single defective LED chips.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-020-01563-4,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This question’s answer is not simple nor easy to find because artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, such as Alexa, Bixbi, or Siri, are amorphous compound technology and multi-purpose tools. Most of an assistant’s components provide unique benefits on their own. Mobility, voice interaction, the delegation of administrative tasks, and rapid data analysis are typical benefits, but they are not exclusive to digital assistants. Understanding an assistant’s benefits helps assistant designers and decision-makers who need to assess whether an assistant is a suitable workforce enhancement tool. Academic literature often describes an assistant’s benefits superficially. This article presents an overview of a preliminary catalog of these benefits in manufacturing. It covers central access, customization, delegation and guidance, eyes-free and hands-free interactions, mobile assistance, the support of multiple interface types, permanent accessibility, and speed. We conclude that the cataloged benefits need more evidence, preferably created during experiments in natural manufacturing environments, to explore and experience the factors that determine the use of a digital assistant.

Moreover, we use a convolutional auto-encoder to generate multi-agent state. To avoid physical costs during MARL training, we establish a simulator, named Virtual Credit Factory, to pre-train the MARL algorithm.

The game approach serves as the methodological basis of the research. The authors use the methodology of game theory to compare the advantages, risks and risks (probability of application) of the three available options for organizing production on the basis of the Internet of things. Findings : It was found that the advantages of production organization based on the Internet of things for the enterprise of Industry 4.0 are associated with productivity growth, achieving “economies of scale”, reducing the share of faults and risks—with disruptions to machinery (production stoppage) due to insufficient provision of cyber security. Employees benefit from an increase in the intellectual component of work (routine processes are performed by machines), while the risk is associated with unemployment—the need for retraining or professional development. Advantages for consumers are associated with increased environmental efficiency of production by increasing the availability and quality of products, and the risk is associated with the energy crisis due to multiple increases in energy consumption by businesses.

Thus, this study uses a recent language model called GPT-2 to generate artificial maintenance reports. These artificial samples are employed to mitigate the class imbalance when training a Deep Learning (DL) architecture named CamemBERT.

However due to their sensing and communications capabilities, 3D-printers are Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks, such as defect injection attacks. By maliciously manipulating the behavior of a 3D-printer, an attacker can compromise the integrity of a manufactured objects. To avoid detection, the adversary also compromises the sensor data reported by the 3D-printer that the operator could use to detect the attack. In this paper, we design a deep neural network that can detect such attacks by predicting the power consumption of a 3D-printer based on the object design and previous power consumption observations. By analyzing the difference between the predicted power consumption and the observed one, we can determine if the 3D-printer is under attack. By measuring the power consumption of the 3D-printer at the power line with an independent sensor, we can determine the true behavior of the 3D-printer without relying on sensor data reported by the potentially compromised 3D-printer.

This chapter acknowledges the key developments in Industrial IoT Access Control and analyzes a new authorization system and process flexibility customized to IIoT. Precisely the kind of protocols and applications in Industrial IoT networks and computers, preceding access control is difficult. Well, industry creates efficiency; nevertheless, there are multiple activities in industries that are also labor-intensive and ineffective manually. For example, nowadays, in a warehouse or out in the market, inventory of quality management is only automated for an insignificant excess of goods so creating such automation makes economic sense. The basic design of deep learning is that the computer learns from past data, knowledge data, observations it advances, and can forecast new unknown scenarios with any technical headways by artificial neural networks. The Deep Learning (DL) approach appears in the form of a widespread manner that helps IIoT machines accessible and cost-friendly with vast quantities of quality inspection materials. To accomplish these goals, it requires to review the current access control mechanism and architecture and audit IIoT’s access control responsibilities using DL. Using anomaly detection, deep learning will predict and determine when processes are likely to malfunction, scheduling the control and maintaining the whole process going much smoother and more effectively. The IIoT program measures efficiency more reliably through DL approach due to the vast number of Big databases at low cost by cloud storage. The core components of IoT’s protection and privacy are access management and Authentication infrastructure, honesty, availability and secrecy are the key safety attributes that suit inefficient access control. Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability (AAA) are three full access control features. These AAA involve phases of a collection of rules (security and regulation), model implementation, structure, policy execution, and compliance of the prescribed protocol. The Industrial Internet of Things must fulfill the duty (policy, model, mechanism) to fulfill the goal. Using a Deep learning mechanism, the OS will decide depending on the protection label scheme. Access management mechanisms identify users by checking deep-learning multifactor authentication. It needs several users to authenticate and approve the required level to reach the next execution. This chapter contains four separate access control models that explain numerous protection and regulation phrases. If the trained model is able, it can access power over IIoT applications effectively, making sense and cost-friendly.

Here, we are interested in how to perform the learning when the ground truth isn’t included in the learning data but is observable indirectly in another related dataset. This paper introduces a fully unsupervised variation of co-training that allows to include this second dataset, with two learning strategies (split and recursive). In our experiments, we propose one simple probabilistic graphical model used for predicting the state of a machine tool from results given by several sensors, and illustrate our unsupervised co-training strategies first with benchmarks available from the UCI repository, for which 4 out of 5 datasets have best results with the recursive strategy.

In particular, this chapter presents learning societies against a recent, urgent, concentrated example of a truly global disruption: the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. While COVID-19 is global in scale and interconnected in complexity, its impact is still very local—hence the importance of place and context . This opens up the relevance and urgency of the learning society concept to be applied in practice. The current practice of utilizing a learning city approach to learning societies is growing. But to truly implement this concept, what is needed is an application of the theory of lifelong learning and learning societies that considers place and context.

Cyber-physical systems form the backbone of Industry 4.0. Cyber-physical systems use modern control systems with embedded software connected through IoT. Basically, cyber-physical systems build the facilities required in recent industries. Industry 4.0 is a blend of automations and data exchanges in various technologies like manufacturing industries, retail industries, and public services like hospitals and schools. With Industry 4.0, it is possible to develop smart applications to fight with the uncommon situation like COVID-19. Pandemics are the sudden attacks on public health, due to which the public services like hospitals collapse. Such situations demand the requirement of a medical facility in a nonlinear way which is hard to handle with traditional demand–supply strategy. This may lead to insufficient occupancy of services, etc. This insufficient occupancy leads to big losses in public health and lives. These scenarios can be handled by promoting the usage of advanced technology as a substitute for many services. Industry 4.0 revolutions are capable of handling such sudden situations like COVID-19 wherein social distancing plays a key role in stopping the spread of this. In a pandemic situation like COVID-19, the manpower requirement can be replaced with automated devices and cyber-physical systems, which will assist and substitute humans in providing the various services like real-time assistance, observation, medication, and sanitization. This chapter discusses the Industry 4.0 applications, methods, and case studies in various applications, which are essential to handle the sudden pandemic like COVID-19.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-3227-3_13,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The failures become considerable when these equipments are used in industries and in smart grid. The more common failures are because of high vibrations, and sometimes, it may lead to complete shutdown of the system.

The condition monitoring (CM) system is reliable and predictive when machine learning and data analytics are implemented. There are various machine learning techniques that help to detect the fault in minimum time using the historical data of the equipment and data analytics. It also helps to avoid the permanent failure of the electrical rotating equipment.

The quality errors such as not extruding at start of the print, not sticking to the bed, stringing or oozing, layer shifting, layer separation and stops extruding mid print can lead to complete wastage of material and time. Detecting such defects while printing the piece will help eradicating the wastage of material and saves lots of valuable time. Providing a proper checkpoints and critical design identification where the defects are highly vulnerable can help us perform corrective measures in the early stages of printing. Here we present our findings on a novel approach based on visual pattern mining using volumetric elemental pixels popularly known as Voxels. The proposed finding provides an accelerated process monitoring and detection of printing failure conditions—by the method of classifying every layer of the printing 3D model into critical and normal layers using advanced deep learning pattern mining approach with convolutional neural networks and automatic choice of critical checkpoints from the classification, to calculate error deviation between the Voxel image of critical 3D printed layer with actual image of same layer from the semi-finished part. Integration of a camera in 3D printer, Voxel separation and processing, pattern mining, and deep machine learning provides the above-proposed system which results in high test accuracy >93% on unknown raw models. Images of parts are taken at various stages of the printing process according to the part geometry, and Voxel images are extracted from >20k 3D models. A deep learning method, convolutional neural networks (CNN), is proposed to classify the parts into either ‘normal’ or ‘critical’ category.

Usually, a workshop has a lot of assembly lines. How to process large data on so many production lines in real-time and accurately is a difficult problem. To solve this problem, we use the concept of fog computing to design the system. By offloading the computation burden from the cloud server center to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely data. Our system has two obvious advantages. The first one is to apply Lie Group Machine Learning to fog computing environment to improve the computational efficiency and robustness of the system. The other is that without increasing any production costs, it can quickly detect products, reduce network latency, and reduce the load on bandwidth.

One of its aims is to provide strategies that can be used to pre-process an in-depth, slightly flawed industrial equipment log to allow for further analysis. The pre-processing is achieved by identifying the flaws, removing the non-value added events and a heuristic methodology to cluster the log into individual sequences. Expert knowledge then is encoded into engineering features to extend the log matrix and prepare it for machine learning model generation for identification of the complete cases. To derive value from the available data, the sequences are plotted into Gantt charts, and eight hypotheses are introduced that allow for automated annotations within this chart to highlight potential areas of improvement.

This research develops a system that aims to engage manufacturing power consumers through price- and incentive-based DR programs.

Optical methods are perfectly suited to be used in ceramics manufacturing as they are fast, versatile, and noncontacting. However, they have to be adopted to the specifics of any process. The methods presented here are methods used within an additive manufacturing device focused on various specific shaping technologies in development. Laser Speckle Photometry (LSP) is an optical nondestructive testing method. It is based on the dynamic analysis of time-resolved speckle patterns that are generated by an external excitation. In this chapter, we will present two investigation categories using the LSP technique for lithography-based Vat Photopolymerization (CerAM VPP): first, detection of surface defects caused by local failures by selectively fill-up during the building up of layer and second, the supervision of mixing of two components in uncured slurry (suspension) or already cured multimaterial. In a second part, the results of inline characterization of correct layering of drops during Multi Material Jetting (CerAM MMJ) are presented. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) method utilizes a short coherence light to illuminate the investigated sample. Depending on the optical properties of the sample, especially the translucency at the wavelengths used, the light can penetrate from couple hundreds of micrometers to couple of millimeters into the sample. Presence of inclusions, pores, defects, delamination will cause a partial or total backscattering of the light.

In this study, a small-scale comparison with regard to the impact of different classifiers in DDM is presented. Six well-established classifiers are introduced in order to compare their performance and evaluate their impact on DDM, namely Naïve Bayes (NB), Hoeffding Tree (HT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Passive Aggressive (PAC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Very Fast Decision Rules (VFDRC) classifiers. Streaming Ensemble Algorithm (SEA dataset) was selected to validate our simulations due to its suitability regarding concept drift detection and handling, incorporating abrupt concept changes. Confusion matrices were used to effectively juxtapose the performance of the considered algorithms in the SEA dataset. The findings suggest that KNN exhibits the best overall accuracy (87%) and seems to be the most stable algorithm compared to NB (86%), HT (86%) and VFDRC (84%) classifiers.

To maintain the security of ICSs from cyber-attacks, they were placed on isolated communication networks, where they were relatively obscure and unknown to most attackers. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in ICSs opens up the possibility of remote monitoring, access, and control of the critical infrastructure (CI), leading to more agile and efficient systems. This is called the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, this integration increases the vulnerabilities of ICS towards cyber-attacks. Due to the IIoT and ICS environment, a compromise in the system may lead to severe danger to human life or the environment. The growing number of cyber-attacks against IIoT in recent years elevates a significant concern for proper and timely security solutions for these systems. Besides, due to the differences between the IT and OT networks, IT cyber-security tools and systems are not suitable for IIoT. These differences include network protocols and types of assets. Besides, in the IT networks, the main focus is on throughput management of the network, while the OT focuses on reliability and punctuality. In this chapter, cyber-attack detection in IIoT using Machine Learning (ML) techniques was discussed, and an unsupervised deep representation learning was proposed to handle the imbalanced IIoT data.

Analysis of publications of specialized international organizations, statistical data, and news releases has revealed that the financial sector holds a special place in the modern economy and therefore has to play a key role in confronting environmental challenges by mobilizing financial resources for sustainable activities, providing insurance coverage and helping to manage and hedge ESG-associated risks. However, despite the growing willingness of individuals to invest sustainably, institutional investors now face numerous difficulties when trying to respond to this shift in demand by adapting their investment strategies and offering specialized financial instruments. These difficulties include, among others, the lack of standardized definitions of sustainable activities and instruments; the voluntary and inconsistent nature of corporate ESG disclosure; the complex and long-term character of ESG-related risks. Digital technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence artificial intelligence , can contribute to elimination of these difficulties by identifying, collecting, standardizing, and analyzing the vast amounts of inconsistent ESG-related data in order to evaluate sustainability risks and to provide insights on a company’s ESG performance even in the absence of standardized disclosure and at significantly reduced cost in comparison with manual research. However, digital technologies can themselves pose ESG-related risks, producing negative effects on environment, employment, inequality, and raising privacy concerns. It is therefore recommended that national authorities should not only promote the wider use of digital technologies in sustainable finance, but also set up legal frameworks to guard against the associated risks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-75405-1_33,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The inspections are carried out by artificial vision cameras based on patterns recognitions algorithms. The efficiency to recognize patterns depends on many variables such as the position of the pieces, changes in the brightness, appearance of dust, sensor deterioration, etc. The use of convolutional neural networks has proven to be an effective method to perform this type of recognition in images. Furthermore, automotive industry requires more information and data on what is happening at each stage of the process.

This process often leads to the construction of a real-time, collaborative, and intelligent virtual factory of their physical factory (so-called digital twin). The application of digital twins and frontier technologies in production planning still faces many challenges. But the research is still limited about how these frontier technologies can be applied to enhance production planning. This paper introduces how to enhance material resource planning (MRP) with digital twins and other frontier technologies, and presents a framework for the integration of MRP software with digital twin technologies. Indeed, the data collected from the shop floor can improve the accuracy of the optimization models used in the MRP software. First, several MRP parameters are unknown when planning, and some of these parameters may be accurately forecasted from the data with machine learning. Nevertheless, the forecast will never be perfect, and the variability of some parameters may have a critical impact on the resulting plan. Therefore, the optimization approach must properly account for these uncertainties, and some methods must allow building probability distribution from the data. Second, as the optimization models in MRP are based on aggregated data, the resulting plans are usually not implementable in practice. The capacity constraints may be acquired by communication with an accurate simulation of the execution of the plan on the shop floor.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-85874-2_34,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Later, in ancient Greek tragedy, onto the stage of divine circumstances, suddenly came the man himself—a hero. In the Age of Enlightenment, the man unexpectedly became an infinite potential capable of discovering the whole universe. However, with the advancement of techno-scientific transformations, the focus Focus is changed again. It is no longer on the human, but on technology, the development and training of the instrument. Moreover, again, reverently stunned, but this time adorned with the symbolic amulets of technology instead of flora and fauna, the man looks at the immense scale Scale of technology. He marvels at the growth Growth of “unlimited” possibilities of artificial super-intelligence.

A typical approach is the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to assess and classify quality issues in images of the production outputs. However, many companies report project challenges and prohibitive computational costs. The challenges arise because of lack of big data required for machine and deep learning model training and lack of data scientists with domain knowledge to build and run complex models. Today manufacturers operate at six sigma levels of quality, and thus have extremely few defect samples. In many cases production changes frequently, and thus the data collection and model training have to be re-done for the new outputs. In this paper we propose two approaches - motif discovery from small sample data and visual motif discovery being simple and intuitive for any engineer to use.

In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic pricing of perishable products using DQN value function approximator. A model-free reinforcement learning approach is used to maximize revenue for a perishable item with fixed initial inventory and selling horizon. The demand is influenced by the price and freshness of the product. The conventional tabular Q-learning method involves storing the Q-values for each state-action pair in a lookup table. This approach is not suitable for control problems with large state spaces. Hence, we use function approximation approach to address the limitations of a tabular Q-learning method. Using DQN function approximator we generalize the unseen states from the seen states, which reduces the space requirements for storing value function for each state-action combination. We show that using DQN we can model the problem of pricing perishable products.

Anomalies can appear in the system due to various reasons such as hardware and software malfunctions, or a cyber-attack. No matter what the origin of the anomaly is, always the main goal is to discover anomalies in the early stages of occurrence to prevent any critical damage or loss. However, there are major challenges in designing an efficient anomaly detection system including difficulty in defining normal regions, normal behavior variations over time, different anomaly definitions in various domains, lack of suitable datasets, and the noise presence in the datasets. Moreover, there are several other challenges which are specific to the industrial IoT environments, such as strict time and resource constraints. In this respect, different studies have addressed the problem of classification and intelligent mining of anomalies in IIoT from different perspectives. In this chapter our main focus is on intelligent mining techniques such as machine learning based approaches that have been proposed in the literature for an efficient anomaly detection in IIoT systems. In this respect, we review existing studies highlighting their main features.

Manufacturing companies are pursuing breakthroughs by introducing various advanced technologies to ensure their competitiveness. However, it is difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt smart-factory technologies, owing to financial and technical burdens. This paper proposes a smart factory that can be applied technically and strategically to the introduction of a smart factory for SMEs. The concept of an ‘appropriate smart factory’ involves applying appropriate measures in terms of cost and scale with consideration of the situations faced by SMEs. The goal is to build a smart factory that has necessary functions (Essential) but can be easily operated (Simple) at a low cost (Affordable) and has compatibility (Interoperable). This paper presents technical application measures such as appropriate smart sensors, appropriate IoT (Internet of Things), and small data processing, along with the definition of an appropriate smart factory. In addition, a case study was examined where the quality inspection equipment for garment manufacturing SMEs was developed by applying the appropriate smart factory concept.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12541-020-00445-2,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Among all the particulate matter of air pollution, PM2.5 (whose aerodynamic diameter is 2.5 μm or less) is of particular concern. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 can negatively affect human health. The negative effects of PM2.5 make forecast its concentration an urgent need. In this paper, we propose a novel Factory-aware Attentional LSTM Model (FAA-LSTM) for PM2.5 air pollution predictions. The proposed model collects air pollution data from both the monitor stations and micro air quality sensors, in which a spatial transformation is designed to obtain the local area data of PM2.5 grids. Next, a novel factory-aware attention mechanism over a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to extract the hidden features of industrial factors and derive their factory attention weights on the influences of PM2.5 concentrations. The influence of neighboring factory data over local PM2.5 grids can be weighted to discover the importance of PM2.5 concentrations of neighboring areas. Moreover, the model combines these heterogeneous data and the global station data to forecast PM2.5 concentrations. The experiment’s evaluation is conducted using both air pollution data and industrial data. The results show that the factory-aware attention mechanism helps to improve the prediction performance by exploring the effect of the factory distribution on PM2.5 pollutants in the local areas. While monitoring stations have been established to collect air quality information and forecast air quality, few studies have taken the different monitoring areas and industrial features into account. The proposed novel model considering PM2.5 concentrations from local neighboring areas and global station, and industrial data as features can effectively indicate the impact of PM2.5 pollution with industrial emissions and spatial relationships. Our research work can improve the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 and contribute to increasing the practical value for air quality management.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00607-020-00849-y,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To date, however, only 27 countries, plus the European Union, have coordinated national AI strategies, and despite the importance of “owning the right type of data” and “enabling an AI-capable talent talent pool,” which undoubtedly must include women, no single national AI strategy outlines women’s inclusion inclusion , or gender gender more broadly, as an exclusive strategic priority. Unfortunately, adequate data and theories regarding this topic are not yet available, and academic research into the political and national strategies around AI beyond national security security considerations is scant. To assist in informing future research on this topic, this chapter will focus on the following questions: Is ensuring the participation of women in the development, deployment, and governance governance of AI vital to the future success, security security , and prominence of nations in the 4IR? If so, should women’s inclusion inclusion in AI be considered an exclusive priority in national AI strategies? I examine the research questions from a qualitative approach utilising academic research from a variety of fields, such as security security , business, science, technology technology , women and gender gender studies as well as relevant news articles and data from government government and intergovernmental organisations. I conclude that women’s inclusion inclusion in AI is a significant factor in ensuring the successful development, deployment, and governance governance of AI. I suggest that a potential strategy include women in national AI strategies is “gender mainstreaming,” defined by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as “the deliberate consideration of gender gender in all stages of program and policy planning, implementation and evaluation, with a view to incorporate the impact of gender at all levels of decision-making.”",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-0771-4_10,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Preceded by a discussion on the theoretical approach employed here, this chapter is structured in three substantial parts addressing: first, South Africa’s policy position on the 4IR; second, the role of women historically in the development of computer science and global debates on AI and gender bias; and third, how the global experience of women and 4IR-related technologies is and may impact on women in South Africa. The analysis indicates that if advanced 4IR technologies and policies that seek to govern their use and development do not take into account the values and lived experiences of those they will effect, it can result in discrimination and bias, particularly for women.

Due to several factors, including complexity of life insurance products, gap in understanding the importance of policy renewals and lack of appropriate engagement with the customers, higher lapsation rates for life insurance policies have been observed globally, specifically in India. Typically for a life insurance company, policy renewal premiums drive close to 60–70% revenue and retaining customers for a period of more than 6–7 years is critical to business profitability. Customer retention operations primarily include engaging with customers through telephonic renewal calls or other mediums to pay renewal premiums on time . With close to 70% of total policies present in the premium renewal base, tracking, scheduling, execution of customer retentions calls and campaigns contribute to a major cost head for life insurers. In this paper, the authors present an advanced analytic solution to effectively manage customer retention costs and improve the overall persistency. The paper demonstrates the use of several machine learning and deep learning neural network-based models to classify the customers based on propensity of not paying renewal premiums on time. The study includes a comparative analysis of model performance with the deep learning neural network model showing the highest performance. The propensity scores were used to create a solution driving differentiated retention strategy, matching customer segment with appropriate renewal efforts to reduce customer retention cost and improve persistency.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-33-6656-5_6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These problems are caused by the policies of wholesalers, which optimize their business processes by passing on better, i.e. cheaper prices for bulk procurement or even just selling products only in large quantities. These policies mainly confer benefits to big companies and leading to the elimination of small customers who want to order only small amounts of a product. That is the reason why smaller and mid-sized metal enterprises must invest a lot of time to find the right suppliers and to order the right products. To save time and money, there are already a few known approaches like marketplaces and shops. However, these solutions do neither solve the problem of finding the right wholesaler nor do they automate the whole process from order to delivery. This paper focuses on an approach to simplify the sourcing and procurement processes by automating parts of it. To achieve this goal, an automated bot technology is suggested which allows for an easy search for dealers and potential suppliers. The implemented bots will be linked to a web crawler with a matching algorithm to detect relevant offers in the world wide web. All information gathered by the crawler will then be processed automatically to start a request for quotation (RFQ) process. The artificial intelligence starts the RFQ process by (1) analyzing existing offers found in the world wide web with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and (2) generating automated written requests to dealers. The algorithm will additionally help by finding other prospective buyers, i.e. other small or mid-sized companies which are interested in the same product. This enables a group of customers to perform bulk procurement together. This paper discusses the current possibilities as well as the practical implications of the suggested approach.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-68476-1_9,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Because insurance is a model example of a data-intensive industry, companies are already applying AI-powered technology and searching for opportunities for further use. However, any important step in automation may trigger a leadership shift and a research gap has been identified in the development of leadership positions in insurance companies confronted with the use of AI. Specifically, the objective is to investigate how leadership could change due to the introduction of AI as an example of digitalization. For this study within an interpretive paradigm, qualitative data were collected in 19 semi-structured interviews, with interviewees representing five insurance companies headquartered in Western Europe. The findings suggest that the use of AI and its implications for leadership are closely linked to the underlying structures of the industry, which has led to the existing leadership discourse and organizational metaphor in the first place. The implications of AI, in turn, depend on the leadership discourse and existing structures. Thus, if AI is used only in accordance with the current discourse, the implications for leadership are minimal. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of AI-powered software itself is unlikely to trigger change in leadership. Nevertheless, AI holds significant potential for insurers. For example, AI could support the insurer’s core competencies, and connect companies with broader ecosystems and customer communities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-48332-6_21,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The world is marching into a new period characterised by unprecedented developments in digital technology, physical technology and biological technology and the convergence of their applications. As an agent of economic and social change, robotisation has elicited considerable concern about technological unemployment (Pol and Reveley, Psychosociolog Issues Hum Resour Manag 5(2):169–186, 2017). Coping behaviour is shown to be logically compatible with rationality and well suited to dealing with fear of joblessness. It is argued that coping strategies are needed to assist employees in dealing with the threats that robotisation poses to their future job security. The aim of this chapter is to conceptualise a resilience-based coping strategy for disruptive change in the 4IR (Tan, The fourth industrial revolution: coping with disruptive change.

With HP’s Multi-jet Fusion technology relatively recent entry (2014) into a seemingly stagnant scene of industrial scale powder-based additive manufacturing, it presented itself as an ideal candidate for post-processing optimization using methods of machine learning due to its faster print time. 66% of the Multi-jet Fusion production process, from build job preparation and nesting to delivery of finished parts is comprised of its cooling process step. This cooling process step can take anywhere from 3 to 30 h, depending on a number of factors. While speeding up cooling does not come into question when processing semi-crystalline polymers, such as polyamides, knowing the necessary cooling time with relatively high accuracy, becomes crucial. In this study, a machine learning model was created to predict a significantly more accurate cooling time using a number of build job parameters. The optimized cooling model was trained using the measured cooling times of varying build jobs as output and build job height, number of layers, packing density, number of parts and room temperature as inputs. The machine learning model predicts significantly more accurate cooling times than the manufacturer predictions. Furthermore, as with all machine learning models, it was shown that an increased number of data, resulted in more accurate predictions.

At the same time, traditional security systems fail to detect serious threats of increasing depth and duration. Therefore, alternative, intelligent solutions should be used to detect anomalies in the operating parameters of the infrastructures concerned, while ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of industrial information. Blockchain is an encrypted, distributed archiving system designed to allow for the creation of real-time log files that are unequivocally linked. This ensures the security and transparency of transactions. This research presents, for the first time in the literature, an innovative Blockchain Security Architecture that aims to ensure network communication between traded Industrial Internet of Things devices, following the Industry 4.0 standard and based on Deep Learning Smart Contracts . The proposed smart contracts are implementing (via computer programming) a bilateral traffic control agreement to detect anomalies based on a trained Deep Autoencoder Neural Network.

Trajectory tracking control algorithm is a very important part of industrial robot control system. It is required that the algorithm can realize the continuous tracking of each joint of the robot and the processing and tracking of the desired trajectory. However, due to the strong influence of acceleration and speed on the trajectory tracking of industrial robots, the corresponding control difficulty and control accuracy are seriously affected. Based on the core idea of fuzzy neural network algorithm, the functional relationship between control error and arrival degree is established to improve the control quality of industrial robots. At the same time, combining with the PID feedforward control algorithm, the self-adaptive adjustment of PID parameters is realized, and the accuracy of the tracking algorithm is improved. In order to verify the superiority of the proposed trajectory tracking control algorithm over the traditional PID algorithm, the model of industrial robot is established by using the virtual simulation system Adams.

Prior methods are naturally developed and highly experience-dependent, which falls short for its objectiveness and transferability. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) framework for automatically determining the candidacy of a part or assembly for AM applications is proposed based on machine learning (ML) and carefully selected candidacy criteria. With the goal of supporting efficient candidate screening in the early conceptual design stage, these criteria are further individually decoded to decisive parameters which can be extracted from digital models or resource planning databases. Over 200 existing industrial examples are manually collected and labelled as training data; meanwhile, multiple regression algorithms are tested against each AM potential to find better predictive performance. The proposed DSS framework is implemented as a web application with integrated cloud-based database and ML service, which allows advantages of easy maintenance, upgrade, and retraining of ML models. Two case studies of a hip implant and a throttle pedal are used as demonstrating examples.

Monitoring ultraprecision processes is usually of difficulty due to their innate complexity and low signal-to-noise ratio in sensor signals. Especially for subtle signal variations during small process changes, the conventional statistical process control charts could fail to detect such process anomalies from the sensor signals in the time domain. In this paper, frequency spectra representation of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) vibration sensor signals during subtle process changes is investigated, and the signal patterns uncovered by frequency spectra are utilized to formulate a machine learning–driven in situ process monitoring approach to detect process anomalies in CMP. The proposed approach overcomes the obstacles of differentiating subtle signal changes by transforming them into the frequency domain with Fourier transform and Hilbert-Huang transform and classifying the resulted frequency spectra with random forest. Based on frequency analysis, it can unveil the differences in the signals obscured in the time domain and suppress the high-frequency noise. Consequently, the presented machine learning–driven in situ process monitoring approach detects process anomalies by differentiating the deviated frequency spectra with machine learning. It is validated on our experimental CMP testbed for anomaly detection, and outperforms three benchmark statistical process control charts. For instance, it detects a slurry shutoff anomaly in CMP about ten times faster than the benchmark methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-020-06165-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Process-specific numerical models or mathematical functions are required for the evaluation of parametric combinations in order to improve the quality of the machined parts and machining time. This problem could be categorized as the offline data-driven optimization problem. For such problems, the surrogate or predictive models are useful, which could be employed to approximate the objective functions for the optimization algorithms. This paper presents a data-driven surrogate-assisted optimizer to model the end mill cutting of aluminum alloy on a desktop milling machine. To facilitate that, material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness (Ra), and cutting forces are considered as the functions of tool diameter, spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. The principal methodology is developed using a Bayesian regularized neural network (surrogate) and a beetle antennae search algorithm (optimizer) to perform the process optimization. The relationships among the process responses are studied using Kohonen’s self-organizing map. The proposed methodology is successfully compared with three different optimization techniques and shown to outperform them with improvements of 40.98% for MRR and 10.56% for Ra. The proposed surrogate-assisted optimization method is prompt and efficient in handling the offline machining data. Finally, the validation has been done using the experimental end milling cutting carried out on aluminum alloy to measure the surface roughness, material removal rate, and cutting forces using dynamometer for the optimal cutting parameters on desktop milling center. From the estimated surface roughness value of 0.4651 μm, the optimal cutting parameters have given a maximum material removal rate of 44.027 mm^3/s with less amplitude of cutting force on the workpiece. The obtained test results show that more optimal surface quality and material removal can be achieved with the optimal set of parameters.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-020-06209-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such a learned model is kept updated during collaborative tasks execution. In addition, the learned model is used by a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with Cross-Entropy Method (CEM). The aim of the MPC+CEM is to online optimize the stiffness and damping impedance control parameters minimizing the human effort (i.e, minimizing the human-robot interaction forces). The proposed approach has been validated through an experimental procedure. A lifting task has been considered as the reference validation application (weight of the manipulated part: 10 kg unknown to the robot controller). A KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 has been used as a test platform. Qualitative performance (i.e, questionnaire on perceived collaboration) have been evaluated. Achieved results have been compared with previous developed offline model-free optimized controllers and with the robot manual guidance controller.

A promising approach is the intelligent control of Industrial Energy Supply Systems (IESS), which provide various energy services to industrial production facilities and machines. Due to the high complexity of such systems widespread conventional control approaches often lead to suboptimal operating behavior and limited flexibility. Rising digitization in industrial production sites offers the opportunity to implement new advanced control algorithms e. g. based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize the operational strategies of IESS.This paper presents a comparative study of different controllers for optimized operation strategies. For this purpose, a framework is used that allows for a standardized comparison of rule-, model- and data-based controllers by connecting them to dynamic simulation models of IESS of varying complexity. The results indicate that controllers based on DRL and MILP have a huge potential to reduce energy-related cost of up to 50% for less complex and around 6% for more complex systems. In some cases however, both algorithms still show unfavorable operating behavior in terms of non-direct costs such as temperature and switching restrictions, depending on the complexity and general conditions of the systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s42162-020-00115-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Industrial sensor systems are prone to transmit inaccurate readings, which result in noisy datasets. Noisy datasets inhibit machine learning and knowledge discovery. Using a multi-stage, multi-output process dataset as an experimental case, this article reports a methodology for replacing erroneous sensor values with their predicted likely values. In the methodology, invalid values specified by process owners are first converted to missing values. Then, ReliefF algorithm is used to select the most relevant features to progress for prediction modelling, and also to boost the performance of the prediction model. A Random Forest classifier model is built to predict replacement values for the missing values. Finally, predicted values are inserted into the dataset to fill in the missing entries. With many attributes having a significant number of erroneous values, the invalid values replacement is done one attribute at a time. To do this systematically, the process flow direction and stages in the manufacturing process are exploited to partition the dataset into subsets for model building. The results indicate that the methodology is able to replace erroneous values with likely true values, to a very high degree of accuracy. There is a paucity of this type of methodology for dealing with invalid entries in process datasets. The methodology is useful for both missing and invalid value correction in process datasets. In the future, the plan is to inject the prediction models into streaming data to simultaneously enable erroneous value correction and predictive process monitoring in real-time.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-020-00367-w,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While manufacturing processes are stochastic and rescheduling decisions need to be made under uncertainty, it is still a complicated task to decide whether a rescheduling is worthwhile, which is often addressed in practice on a greedy basis. To find a tradeoff between rescheduling frequency and the growing accumulation of delays, we propose a rescheduling framework, which integrates machine learning (ML) techniques and optimization algorithms. To prove the effectiveness, we first model a flexible job-shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup and limited dual resources (FJSP) inspired by an industrial application. Then, we solve the scheduling problem through a hybrid metaheuristic approach. We train the ML classification model for identifying rescheduling patterns. Finally, we compare its rescheduling performance with periodical rescheduling approaches. Through observing the simulation results, we find the integration of these techniques can provide a good compromise between rescheduling frequency and scheduling delays. The main contributions of the work are the formalization of the FJSP problem, the development of ad hoc solution methods, and the proposal/validation of an innovative ML and optimization-based framework for supporting rescheduling decisions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-020-05850-5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the current approach to printability analysis, determining which components are likely to build unsuccessfully, prior to manufacture, is based on ad-hoc rules and engineering experience. Consequently, to allow full exploitation of the benefits of additive manufacturing, there is a demand for a fully systematic approach to the problem. In this paper we focus on the impact of geometry in printability analysis. For the first time, we detail a machine learning framework for determining the geometric limits of printability in additive manufacturing processes. This framework consists of three main components. First, we detail how to construct strenuous test artefacts capable of pushing an additive manufacturing process to its limits. Secondly, we explain how to measure the printability of an additively manufactured test artefact. Finally, we construct a predictive model capable of estimating the printability of a given artefact before it is additively manufactured. We test all steps of our framework, and show that our predictive model approaches an estimate of the maximum performance obtainable due to inherent stochasticity in the underlying additive manufacturing process.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-020-01541-w,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Since the individual components, especially those of the rotor, are subject to high demands on manufacturing accuracy, it is crucial to ensure a precise and robust assembly. In order to achieve a scalable assembly process, this paper presents a method for a robot-based assembly of the rotationally symmetric components of the rotor. The assembly task has been reduced to the two essential problems: search and insertion. On this basis, a system was developed, which is able to learn the joining process independently and compensate for positioning inaccuracies with the help of reinforcement learning in combination with a position-controlled robot. The applied reinforcement learning strategy is based on the measurement data of a 6-axis force/torque sensor, with which the current contact state can be evaluated and a decision for the next step can be made. The experimental verification shows that an automation of the assembly process is possible with the proposed strategy. The robot is able to perform the search operation successfully, whereas limitations to the achievable accuracies of the insertion process could be found.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11740-020-00968-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

All vehicles should pass the test every 2 years if not older than 6 years or every 1 year for other vehicles. This study provided an insight into the data collected from test centers and the emission test utilized in Kuwait. Data were collected from test centers in the six Kuwaiti governorates. European standards were selected as limits for emission violations. Independent variables included the place of vehicle manufacture, vehicle’s age, and odometer reading. A multinomial logit model was used to identify the significant predictors and determine the correlation between dependent and independent variables. Artificial neural network was employed to compare prediction estimates of neural network and multinomial logit. The findings showed that the place of vehicle’s manufacture, vehicle’s age, and odometer reading were significant regarding violating emission standards of carbon monoxide (CO). Asian vehicles, vehicles with more than 150,000 km mileage, and vehicles older than 15 years had a higher probability of failing the CO test compared to the place of manufacture. In contrast, the odometer reading was the only significant indicator for vehicles that have failed the hydrocarbons test, especially for vehicles with 150,000 km odometer reading.

However, the generation of geometry (or dilution and the resulting porosity) of the deposited tracks is not well understood as it is largely dependent on the laser process settings. In this work, the track dilution generated in single track deposition of Ti-15Mo alloy using the laser additive manufacturing – direct energy deposition (LAM-DED) process is accurately modeled and predicted, using the Matlab software based artificial neural network (ANN). Targeting a mean square error of zero, a 3–7-1 feed-forward, back-propagation, NN architecture with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is developed. The percentage prediction error is calculated to validate the developed ANN model and is found to range between −0.981 and 0.584 establishing the goodness of the fitted model and the high prediction accuracy of track dilution. Further, regression analysis is also conducted for theoretical validation of the experimental track dilution. The correlation coefficient value obtained for 27 data is 0.982 which establishes high confidence in the fitted data.

Many parameters influence the printing process; however, defects resulting from suboptimal parameter settings are usually detected after the process.

In this work, we used a combination of thermographic off-axis imaging as data source and deep learning-based neural network architectures, to detect printing defects. For the network training, a k-fold cross validation and a hold-out cross validation were used. With these techniques, defects such as delamination and splatter can be recognized with an accuracy of 96.80%. In addition, the model was evaluated with computing class activation heatmaps.

The major drawbacks of such manual quality assessment include inter-observer variability, intra-observer variability, lack of speed and poor accuracy. In order to address these challenges, an automated approach, based on machine vision and machine learning, is investigated in this study. Methods Micrographs, obtained during an emulsification process, are classified into four quality-based categories named TAMU (target, acceptable, marginal and unacceptable). A machine learning approach using principal component–based discriminant analysis is employed in this study for the classification. This approach is compared with manual classification results obtained for the same set of micrographs using attribute agreement analysis, which is a methodology of assessing the accuracy and precision of an evaluation system. Results The automated approach is demonstrated to be repeatable, 40% more accurate compared to the least performing analyst and 10% more accurate than the best performing analyst. The results show that the automated classification is superior to manual classification of micrographs with respect to speed (180 times faster), greater accuracy and repeatability. Conclusions The automated approach, implemented as a soft sensor, integrated with real-time image acquisition can be applied for in situ process monitoring of emulsions. The real-time approach can be used to predict the instantaneous product quality as well as optimum process time required to achieve the desirable droplet characteristics, which will avoid over-processing and wastage of resources in pharmaceutical industries.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12247-019-09390-8,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This research provides a case study of a batch manufacturing pharmaceutical facility and compares a number of approaches to modelling the electrical energy consumption in the plant. An accurate model of the electrical energy in the facility will allow more sustainable approaches to be developed. This can be achieved by improving current processes to reduce the electrical load. Historical electrical energy data were modelled using traditional time series methods. Historical manufacturing data and the electrical energy data were used to develop machine learning models using a feedforward neural network and a random forest. All of the approaches were then compared. The major challenge posed in model development and validation was acquiring data suitable for machine learning. The manufacturing data were stored in hand-written records. These records needed to be digitised and then go through a number of transformative steps before the data were suitable for modelling. The random forest model successfully modelled the energy profile of the facility.

In this study, one more step is taken; the improved prediction performance is attained by capturing the individuality of each customer while discovering the hidden pattern from the train set and then applying all the knowledge to the test set. The proposed churn prediction system is developed using artificial neural networks that take advantage of both self-organizing and error-driven learning approaches (ChP-SOEDNN).

To achieve the first objective, ML techniques, tools, activities, and data sources which are required to implement a ML-PPC are reviewed. The second objective is developed through the analysis of the use cases and the addressed characteristics of the I4.0. Results suggest that 75% of the possible research domains in ML-PPC are barely explored or not addressed at all. This lack of research originates from two possible causes: firstly, scientific literature rarely considers customer, environmental, and human-in-the-loop aspects when linking ML to PPC. Secondly, recent applications seldom couple PPC to logistics as well as to design of products and processes. Finally, two key pitfalls are identified in the implementation of ML-PPC models: the complexity of using Internet of Things technologies to collect data and the difficulty of updating the ML model to adapt it to the manufacturing system changes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-019-01531-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The researchers need to perform dataset annotation if a dataset is generated by themselves. It is also one of the restrictive factors that the current method based on deep learning cannot expand well. At present, there are very few workpiece datasets for industrial fields, and the existing datasets are generated from ideal workpiece computer aided design (CAD) models, for which few actual workpiece images were collected and utilized. We propose an automatic industrial workpiece dataset generation method and an automatic ground truth annotation method. Included in our methods are three algorithms that we proposed: a point cloud based spatial plane segmentation algorithm to segment the workpieces in the real scene and to obtain the annotation information of the workpieces in the images captured in the real scene; a random multiple workpiece generation algorithm to generate abundant composition datasets with random rotation workpiece angles and positions; and a tangent vector based contour tracking and completion algorithm to get improved contour images.

To date, few studies have studied the thick plate bending process. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with finite element analysis (FEA) was utilized to investigate the impact of thick plate bending on the MSD of reactor shells. First, tensile tests of 0-10% pre-strained 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25 V specimens were subjected to 390 to 510 °C. The results obtained from this experiment were used to develop ANN with two inputs (temperature and plastic strain) to predict the strength of pre-deformed steel. Subsequently, the plastic strain distribution of reactor shells after warm bending was obtained via FEA. We then inputted the FEA results into well-established ANN to predict the MSD of un-tempered reactor shells. The MSD of an actual tempered reactor shell was measured to study the synergic effect of warm bending and tempering on MSD variation. Results showed that the average absolute relative errors between the proposed ANN and tensile test results were below 4%. The absolute relative errors of the proposed prediction method varied from 0.24 to 7.88%. The proposed method is therefore reliable in the lightweight design of the hydrogenation reactor.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11665-020-05020-4,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1007/s00170-020-05842-5,"Characterization, optimization, and acoustic emission monitoring of airborne dust emission during wood sawing",The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,10.1007/s00170-020-05842-5,Springer,2020-08-01,"This study investigates the airborne dust generation during the wood sawing process. It also develops an intelligent framework for airborne dust monitoring using acoustic emission (AE) sensor during the sawing process of green Douglas-fir wood. It uses AE signals and artificial neural networks to predict the dust emission at different cutting conditions. Also, the statistical effect of cutting parameters on the mass concentration of airborne dust was analyzed. The study investigates sustainable wood manufacturing by considering the effect of airborne dust emission alongside the power consumption and product quality index. It was observed that the mass concentration of the airborne dust is linearly increased with the rotation speed but inversely proportional to the depth of cut, feed speed, and the average chip thickness. The role of the depth of cut and uncut average chip thickness in the generated dust is complex and is more significant when having a small depth of cut. The generated dust emission at different conditions was then compared with its corresponding cutting power and product quality index. The results indicated that developing an AE monitoring system is a reliable method of predicting the amount of inhalable dust that typically measured by an airborne dust detector. This could enable manufacturers to identify the source of high dust emission when different machines are simultaneously operated and adjust their respective cutting parameters to lower the generated airborne dust. A multi-objective optimization should be considered to identify the condition resulting in a low dust emission while having a high product quality and energy-efficient process.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-020-05842-5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Undesirable conditions during machining cause chatter, tool wear, and tool breakage, directly affecting the tool life and consequently the surface quality, dimensional accuracy of the machined parts, and tool costs. Tool condition monitoring is, therefore, extremely important for manufacturing efficiency and economics. Acoustic emission, vibration, power, and temperature sensors monitor the stability and efficiency of the machining process, collecting large amounts of data to detect tool wear, breakage, and chatter. Studies on monitoring the vibrations and acoustic emissions from machine tools have provided information and data regarding the detection of undesirable conditions. Herein, studies on tool condition monitoring are reviewed and classified. As Industry 4.0 penetrates all manufacturing sectors, the amount of manufacturing data generated has reached the level of big data, and classical artificial intelligence analyses are no longer adequate. Nevertheless, recent advances in deep learning methods have achieved revolutionary success in numerous industries. Deep multi-layer perceptron (DMLP), long-short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are among the most preferred methods of deep learning in recent years. As data size increases, these methods have shown promising performance improvement in prediction and learning, compared to classical artificial intelligence methods.

While this approach has proven to be advantageous for the construction industry in Canada, changes in the process of manufacturing panelized walls have brought new challenges and opportunities. With the aim of providing alternatives to current manual quality control activities, an automated vision-based online inspection system for screw-fastening operations in light-gauge steel frame manufacturing is proposed in this paper. Targeting two common defects in the framing process, squareness and the quality of the screw-fastening operation itself, real-time quality assessment of the frame is achieved. The proposed system uses novel machine vision algorithms to generate the inspection data: a squareness estimation algorithm is developed, based on edge detection and the Hough transform, that can determine the squareness of a steel connection with a margin of error less than two degrees, whereas a R-CNN is designed based on a pre-trained ResNet-50 for detection and classification of screw-fastening operations, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.67%. All the inspection results are made accessible through a Python-based interface in order to direct operators towards either identifying potential quality issues or confirming the quality of the product leaving the station.

The current challenge encountered by them is how to enhance the reliability caused by both the uncertainty from noise and the unsuitable specifications of models, on the premise of high predicting accuracy and low computational cost. To meet the current challenge, the OSCM based on the Boundary Forest (OSCM-BF) is proposed in this paper. The BF combines a set of the Tree-Structure Ensemble (TSE) models. In terms of the different values of θ (i.e., the minimum size of leaf nodes), the BF enhances the reliability of a single TSE not only by overlapping the gap segments of output range (i.e., connecting the discontinuous boundaries of leaf nodes), but also by possessing stronger robustness via producing enough diversity. Moreover, a theoretical range of the value of θ constructed by BF is provided. Since the simplicity, the nice interpretability and the flexibility on large-scale data, the moving-window strategy was adopted to realize the update of the BF models. The experiments on the noisy data from the industrial process of Ladle Furnace reveal that the OSCM-BF can enhance the reliability of the OSCM-TSE on the premise of high predicting accuracy and low computational cost.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-019-04584-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Because construction works are often delayed during typhoons, a useful scheme for rain forecasts during typhoon periods is highly desirable. This study developed a regional extreme precipitation and construction suspension estimation system (REPCSES) for the construction industry to use when a structure is in the construction stage. The REPCSES has two major functions: a regional extreme precipitation estimation model (comprising Modules 1 and 2) and the construction suspension estimation model (Modules 3 and 4). Module 1 is a regional 1-h-ahead rainfall estimation model, which is used for estimating the hourly rainfall near the construction location. Module 2 is used for estimating the cumulative rainfall within 24 h. Module 3 is designed to plot a hyetograph using the results from Modules 1 and 2. Then, Module 4 determines whether the construction should be suspended according to the plots from Module 3. In addition, this study developed a deep convolutional neural network model for estimating extreme rainfall during a structure under construction, and the experimental area was Nantou County, Taiwan.

Process analytical technology (PAT) such as online nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is gaining in importance, as it increasingly contributes to automation and digitalization in production. In many cases up to now, however, a classical evaluation of process data and their transformation into knowledge is not possible or not economical due to the insufficiently large datasets available. When developing an automated method applicable in process control, sometimes only the basic data of a limited number of batch tests from typical product and process development campaigns are available. However, these datasets are not large enough for training machine-supported procedures. In this work, to overcome this limitation, a new procedure was developed, which allows physically motivated multiplication of the available reference data in order to obtain a sufficiently large dataset for training machine learning algorithms. The underlying example chemical synthesis was measured and analyzed with both application-relevant low-field NMR and high-field NMR spectroscopy as reference method. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the potential to infer valuable process information already from relatively limited input data. However, in order to predict the concentration at complex conditions (many reactants and wide concentration ranges), larger ANNs and, therefore, a larger training dataset are required. We demonstrate that a moderately complex problem with four reactants can be addressed using ANNs in combination with the presented PAT method (low-field NMR) and with the proposed approach to generate meaningful training data.

The control model is built during consecutive process executions under optimal control via reinforcement learning, using the measured product quality as a reward after each process execution. Prior model formulation, which is required by algorithms from model predictive control and approximate dynamic programming, is therefore obsolete. This avoids several difficulties namely in system identification, accurate modeling, and runtime complexity, that arise when dealing with processes subject to nonlinear dynamics and stochastic influences. Instead of using the pre-created process and observation models, value-function-based reinforcement learning algorithms build functions of expected future reward, which are used to derive optimal process control decisions. The expectation functions are learned online, by interacting with the process. The proposed algorithm takes stochastic variations of the process conditions into account and is able to cope with partial observability.

Indeed, IoT is implanting its footprint in each domain (i.e. health care, transportation, electric grid, agriculture, retail, manufacturing) to make it smart. Like, smart health care uses smart wearable devices equipped with smart sensors and tracking systems to provide live connectivity between patient, doctor and hospitals. Similarly, intelligent transport provides quick response in the accident or other hazardous situations. Smart grid provides complete information about usage of electricity and controlling of power supply. Agriculture monitoring and irrigation of waters and fertilizer using smart agriculture can save lots of time and energy of the farmers. Smart retail and transport can help to track quality of food, to generate easy billing and to provide product recommendation to the customers based on their past shopping habits. Thus, IoT creates big comfort for the businesses, government and peoples in their work of day-to-day life. With the advancement in the comfort, IoT come up with many serious technological challenges. Reliable and secure implementation of IoT application is most important aspect for the long time adaption of IoT. Availability of internet connected tracking devices and environment capturing sensors keep track of personal life of people at the same time it transfer it via internet to the cloud. So to assure security triangle CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) to the people is major challenge for the researchers and developers. Recent attacks using concept of ransomware, in which attackers was seeking bitcoins to enable blocked services has created big financial damage to many people.

The solution to this problem is very complex, since the exact mechanisms that describe a phenomenon and its nonlinearities, are often unknown. At the same time, environmental factors such as the finite precision of the processing machine, noise, and sensor limitations—among others—produce further inaccuracies making even more unfitting the description of the phenomenon described by the collected data. In this context, while developing complex systems, with optimal performance, capable of interacting with the environment in an autonomous way, and showing some form of intelligence, the ultimate solution is to process, identify and recognize such nonlinear dynamics.

There is an increasing interest in machine learning and data mining techniques to improve yield to take advantage of this increasing volume of data. In this chapter, we introduce machine learning yield models for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing yield enhancement. Challenges in this area include class imbalance due to high manufacturing yield, and concept drift due to the time-varying environment. We present batch and online learning methods to tackle the imbalanced classification problem, and incremental machine learning frameworks to overcome concept drift. We consider the packaging and testing process in chip stack flash memory manufacturing as an application. By testing our methods on real data from industry, we show the possibility of packaged memory yield improvement with machine learning-based classifiers detecting bad dies before packaging. Experimental results show significant yield improvement potential. In a time-invariant environment, for stacks of eight dies, we can achieve an approximately 9% yield improvement. In a longer period of time with realistic concept drift, a naive approach using a fixed false alarm rate-based decision boundary is shown to fail to improve yield. In contrast, with optimal thresholds, our incremental learning approach achieves approximately 1.4% yield improvement in the eight-die stack case and 3.4% in the 16-die stack case.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-04666-8_6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Risk assessment as part of risk management poses challenges for many companies, especially SMEs. Existing methods are often complex, subjective and difficult to automate. To address this issue, this paper describes a risk assessment approach that can be fully automated after expert process evaluation. The automated risk assessment is based on a Machine Learning algorithm, which builds a model that predicts the output and allows the use of SPC control charts without measuring component’s characteristics. Based on the results of the control charts, the risk can be assessed by calculating the distances to critical values and analyzing the control chart (e.g. run or trend identification). The use of process parameters, which are recorded by sensors, makes it possible to intervene in the process in high risk situations and reduce not only measurements but also the production of scrap. The method was applied to the use case of an injection molding process of a thin-walled thermoplastic. Based on a Design of Experiments the model was built by a Generalized Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. A predictive validation and an event validation test were used to validate the method. A two-sided t-test at a significance level of α = 5% provided equality between predicted and actual mean value.

This chapter argues that this does not have to be that way because many research problems and solutions as studied in the semiconductor industry are in fact closely related to these machine learning and big data problems. To illustrate this point, we discuss a number of practical but challenging problems arising from semiconductor manufacturing process in this chapter. We first show how machine learning techniques, especially those regression-related problems, often under the “disguise” of optimization problems, have been used frequently (often with nontrivial modeling skills and mathematical sophistications) to solve the semiconductor problems. We discuss such examples as process variation modeling and VLSI chip testing. For some other types of semiconductor problems, such as manufacturing process monitoring and improvement, we show that some existing machine learning algorithms are not necessarily well positioned to solve them, and novel machine learning techniques involving temporal, structural, and hierarchical properties need to be further developed.

In order to take advantage of correlations among the data, multiple parallel signals, coming from a cluster of ultrasonic sensors, have been exploited, producing a number of different features that allowed to achieve more accurate and precise predictions for object detection. Firstly, model-based learning as well as instance-based learning systems have been investigated for an independent time correlation analysis of the different signals.

In the restaurant industry, which suffers from labor shortages, filtering candidates is unrealistic, and it is important to maintain newly hired employees. In this study, we propose a new model, based on recurrent neural networks, that predicts the early turnover of new restaurant employees by using their attendance records and attributes. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model by using anonymized data from a restaurant chain in Japan, and we confirmed that the proposed model performs better than baseline models.

In this context, human-driven processes appear as an essential reality and instruments to create feedback information loops between the social subsystem (people) and the cyber subsystem (technological components) are required. Although many different instruments have been proposed, nowadays pattern recognition techniques are the most promising ones. However, these solutions present some important pending problems. For example, they are dependent on the selected hardware to acquire information from users; or they present a limit on the precision of the recognition process. To address this situation, in this paper it is proposed a two-phase algorithm to integrate people in Industry 4.0 systems and human-driven processes. The algorithm defines complex actions as compositions of simple movements. Complex actions are recognized using Hidden Markov Models, and simple movements are recognized using Dynamic Time Warping. In that way, only movements are dependent on the employed hardware devices to capture information, and the precision of complex action recognition gets greatly increased. A real experimental validation is also carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed solution.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-16184-2_18,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To ensure that the benefits of these technologies, which include significantly improved feasibility of near-term restoration of preindustrial atmospheric CO_2 levels and ocean pH, environmental remediation, significant and rapid reduction in global poverty and widespread improvements in manufacturing, energy, medicine, agriculture, materials, communications and information technology, construction, infrastructure, transportation, aerospace, standard of living, and longevity, are not eclipsed by either public fears of nebulous catastrophe or actual consequential accidents, we propose safe design, operation and use paradigms. We discuss design of control and operational management paradigms that preclude uncontrolled replication, with emphasis on the comprehensibility of these safety measures in order to facilitate both clear analyzability and public acceptance of these technologies. Finite state machines are chosen for control of self-replicating systems because they are susceptible to comprehensive analysis (exhaustive enumeration of states and transition vectors, as well as analysis with established logic synthesis tools) with predictability more practical than with more complex Turing-complete control systems (cf. undecidability of the Halting Problem) [ 1 ].

This study investigates industrial water demand forecasting by case-based reasoning (CBR) in an arid area, with a case study of Zhangye City, China. CBR uses past experience to solve new problems. Since CBR is a methodology rather than a technique, this definition makes case-based reasoning system be an open system, which can constantly absorb new technologies and methods, and be more conducive to the development of itself. This research constructed a case base with 420 original cases of 28 cities in China, extracted six attributes of the industrial water demand, and employed a back propagation neural network (BPN) to weight each attribute, as well as the grey incidence analysis (GIA) to calculate the similarities between target case and original cases. The forecasting values were calculated by weighted similarities. The results show that the industrial water demand of Zhangye in 2030, which is the target case, will reach 11.9 million tons.

A local supporting tool can be moved directly opposed to the forming tool on the other side of the sheet to locally form an accuracy improving die. The two major process parameters of the local support are the support angle and the support force. Although their influence on the forming process is proven, concrete calculation methods for process planning based on the part’s geometry are still missing. To improve the process planning and therefore the geometric accuracy of the formed part, the authors present a novel approach where the parameterization of the local support is done by machine learning. Specifically, various artificial neural networks are trained with a process database gathered in a preceding experimental survey. Their performance to predict the resulting geometric deviation of every toolpath point is compared under different aspects. The most precise artificial neural network is used to predict the combination of support force and support angle that minimizes the geometric deviation. Afterwards, a laplacian smoothing function is presented to prevent rapid changes of the process parameters and to keep the forming process controllable. In the end, the approach is experimentally validated with the part used to build up the process database and an additional part to demonstrate the transferability of the approach.

Rainbow (Q-Learning) and PPO (Policy Optimisation) have shown outstanding performance in a variety of tasks, including Atari 2600, MuJoCo, and Roboschool test suite. Although these algorithms are fundamentally different, both suffer from high variance, low sample efficiency, and hyperparameter sensitivity that, in practice, make these algorithms a no-go for critical operations in the industry. On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning focuses on learning the transition dynamics between states in an environment. If the environment dynamics are adequately learned, a model-based approach is perhaps the most sample efficient method for learning agents to act in an environment optimally. The traits of model-based reinforcement are ideal for real-world environments where sampling is slow and in mission-critical operations. In the warehouse industry, there is an increasing motivation to minimise time and to maximise production. In many of these environments, the literature suggests that the autonomous agents in these environments act suboptimally using handcrafted policies for a significant portion of the state-space. In this paper, we present The Dreaming Variational Autoencoder v2 (DVAE-2), a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that increases sample efficiency, hence enable algorithms with low sample efficiency function better in real-world environments. We introduce the Deep Warehouse environment for industry-near testing of autonomous agents in logistic warehouses.

Moreover, there is no agreement about the necessary level of interpretability of such solution and on how this level can be determined, measured and achieved. In this article, we provide such definitions based on research as well as our extensive experience of building ML solutions for various organisations across industries. We present CRISP-ML, a detailed step-by-step methodology, that provides guidance on creating the necessary level of interpretability at each stage of the solution building process and is consistent with the best practices of project management in the ML settings.

In addition to a better overview of the surrounding area, they enable to capture objects at extremely close ranges. These advantages come at a cost of strong image distortion, which cannot be removed completely maintaining image continuity. This complicates the use of traditional computer vision algorithms, which expect a single image as an input. This paper presents a performance evaluation of neural network algorithms for object detection and segmentation on fisheye camera images. Three approaches are evaluated: semantic image segmentation with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [ 13 ], a fully convolutional approach to instance segmentation with U-Net [ 18 ] and a region-based approach to instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN [ 10 ]. All of these networks successfully solved the task. However, as they were designed to different purposes, each of them has its own strengths and shortcomings. These three approaches are used to perform euro container image segmentation task. An image dataset was created in order to train and evaluate these algorithms.

There are several ways to control energy consumption and power requirements through intelligent energy and power management, such as utilizing excess heat, thermal energy storage and local renewable energy sources. Intelligent energy and power management in an operational setting is only possible if the time-varying performance of the individual components of the energy system is known. This paper presents an approach to model the compressors in an industrial, operational two-stage cooling system, with CO $$_2$$ as the working fluid, located in an advanced food distribution warehouse in Norway. An artificial neural network is adopted to model the compressors using the operational data. The model is trained with cooling medium evaporation and condensation temperature, suction gas temperature and compressor operating frequency, and outputs electrical power load and cooling load. The best results are found by using a single hidden layer with 45 hidden neurons and a hyperbolic tangent activation function trained with the Adam optimizer, with a resulting mean squared error as low as 0.08% for both the training and validation data sets. The trained model will be part of a system implemented in a real-world setting to determine the cooling load, compressor power load, and coefficient of performance.

This process involves a wide range of uncertainties, which make it a challenging task. Because of unknown issues, using the experience of the experts or looking for similar cases are the conventional methods to deal with cost estimation. The current study presents data-driven methods for cost estimation based on the application of artificial neural network (ANN) and regression models. The learning algorithms of the ANN are the Levenberg–Marquardt and the Bayesian regulated. Moreover, regression models are hybridized with a genetic algorithm to obtain better estimates of the coefficients. The methods are applied in a real case, where the input parameters of the models are assigned based on the key issues involved in a spherical tank construction. The results reveal that while a high correlation between the estimated cost and the real cost exists; both ANNs could perform better than the hybridized regression models. In addition, the ANN with the Levenberg–Marquardt learning algorithm (LMNN) obtains a better estimation than the ANN with the Bayesian-regulated learning algorithm (BRNN). The correlation between real data and estimated values is over 90%, while the mean square error is achieved around 0.4.

In this research, a novel method was developed for predicting the pixel value’s non-uniformity due to the heel effect of X-ray tube on the imaging plane using Monte Carlo N particle (MCNP) simulation code and artificial neural network (ANN). At first, an industrial X-ray tube and a computed radiography (CR) image plate were simulated using MCNP. Then, the simulation procedure was benchmarked with an experiment. In the next step, nine images were obtained from the simulation for nine different tube voltages in the range of 100–300 kV. Furthermore, some pixels with tangential and polar angles in the range of 0°–20° and of 0°–180° with respect to the centered pixel were chosen from these nine simulated images in order to train the ANN, respectively. The tube voltage, tangential and polar angles of each pixel were used as the three inputs of the ANN and gray value in each pixel was used as the output. After training, the proposed ANN model could predict the gray value of each pixel on the imaging plane with mean relative error of less than 0.23%. In the last step, the predicted gray value difference between the centered pixel and other pixels was calculated. The great advantage of proposed methodology is providing the possibility of predicting the pixel value’s non-uniformity due to the heel effect of the X-ray tube on the imaging plane for a wide range of the tube voltages and source to film distances independent of the tube current and exposure time.

The multiscale decomposition approach using continuous and discrete wavelets is widely applied to take into account scales dependency. However, the optimal choice of the analysis wavelet function and the number of decomposition level is still a big issue. In this article, the artificial neural network theory was combined with the wavelet concept and was optimized based on the genetic algorithm to identify the relevant wavelet function for multiscale characterization of abraded surface topographies. Then, an extensive wavelet function library was developed and the proposed algorithm was applied to topographic data obtained from various abrasive finishing processes. The results show the pertinence of this approach to select the relevant wavelet, and a universal relevant wavelet function for abraded surface characterization was determined.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-018-1756-9,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In particular, an adaptation mechanism is introduced that automatically evaluates the performance of the network and then updates its weights to fit the current environmental conditions. The retraining algorithm trusts as much as possible the current conditions ( discriminative constraints ), while simultaneously providing a minimal degradation of the already obtained knowledge of the network ( generative constraints ). The underline assumption is that a small weight perturbation is adequate to modify the performance of the network to the new situations, without this constraint implying a small modification of the network output due to the highly non-linear surface that the network models. Under this assumption, we propose a computationally efficient re-training algorithm to tackle the variations of the visual environment, requiring a small number of labelled samples for the adaptation. Weight updating is combined with an unsupervised learning paradigm, implemented through stacked autoencoders, in order to improve convergence, stability and performance of the object tracking and labeling process by propagating the sensory inputs into deep level of hierarchies and therefore structuring the inputs from low representations to more abstract forms. Approximates of current visual environment are provided through a dynamic tracker that combines motion and learning features to automatically create few confident labeled data. The proposed retraining scheme is computationally efficient and able to model non-stationary environments, like the ones appeared in real-life computer vision application scenarios. Experimental results and comparisons are provided on video datasets of very complicated visual content, monitoring industrial workflows of car assembly within a manufactory. The results indicates that our self-adaptive deep neural network architecture is able to correctly label and separate foreground objects from background even under severe visual changes, such as occlusion, illumination variations and change of camera views, and within real time computational constraints.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-017-5349-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper aims to discuss the rate of success for recreating the G-Code of an object from the acoustic features and further elaborates on regression model analysis that provides the G-Code. Acoustic and G-Code data was analyzed in a training phase and an attack phase. In the training phase, a supervised machine learning algorithm was trained using Python, which is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. During the attack phase, the created algorithm was used to process new acoustic data and to reconstruct the G-Code. The accuracy of the classification models and the regression models were determined. The classification accuracy was determined with k-fold cross validation, and the regression model accuracy was determined by scoring the regression models within the algorithm. Although classification and regression algorithms developed showed promising results, lower model accuracy was observed when the X and Y motors moved together. In the future, the team hopes to further increase the model accuracy so that an unknown shape can be replicated successfully. While security measures for cyber-security have previously been investigated, very little research has considered acoustic side-channel attacks on their ability to reconstruct G-Code and steal intellectual property.

To ensure success in drug manufacturing, regulatory agencies often mandate appropriate acceptance criteria for process intermediates to increase the likelihood of the drugs meeting the final release specification. When setting acceptance criteria for process intermediates, it is important to first understand process capability, or the impurity clearance of each process step. However, this process involves either challenging experimentation or an estimation method that might not be comprehensive. In this study, we propose the use of neural network to understand process capability. This approach not only will be able to delineate the relationship between the feed and product impurity level for a specific step but will also be able to define the acceptance criteria for the feed (or product from previous process step) impurity level based on a predetermined product impurity level. These acceptance criteria will enable us to determine whether or not to forward process the step based on the feed impurity level. Method Process impurity data are a combination of actual data collected from actual manufacturing lots and simulated data. Impurity clearance for a specific step is estimated using a conventional method and a neural network, a method that we propose in this study. Result and Conclusion Since impurity clearance is usually dependent on the input impurity level, using neural network to estimate process capability and ultimately to define process intermediates acceptance criteria has been shown to be more useful than the conventional method.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12247-017-9301-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Particularly, four diverse machine learning approaches are implemented: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, and soft computing methods. We evaluate if there is one approach that outperforms the others when predicting the reliability of all the components, analyze if machine learning models improve their performance in the presence of censored data, and finally, understand the performance impact when the number of available inputs changes. Our experimental results show the high ability of machine learning to predict the component reliability and particularly, random forest, which generally obtains high accuracy and the best results for all the cases.

In this context, manufacturing companies require an innovative strategy to survive in a competitive business environment, utilizing those technologies. Guided by these requirements, the so-called predictive maintenance is of paramount importance and offers a significant potential for innovation to overcome the limitations of traditional maintenance policies. However, real shop-floors often have obstacles in providing insights to facilitate the effective management of assets in smart factories. Even if a significant amount of machine and process data is available, one of the common problems of these data is the lack of annotations describing the machine status or maintenance history. For this reason, companies have limited options to analyse manufacturing data, despite the capability of advanced machine learning techniques in supporting the identification of failure symptoms in order to optimize scheduling of maintenance operations. Moreover, each machine generates highly heterogeneous data, making it difficult to integrate all the information to provide data-driven decision support for predictive maintenance. Inspired by these challenges, this research provides a hybrid machine learning approach combining unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning.

Tin single tracks were formed by a self-developed liquid metal flow rapid cooling metal additive manufacturing equipment with different process parameters. The cross sections of tin single tracks were observed by metallographic microscope, and fitted by Matlab software. The relational model between the process parameters and the cross section geometry of tin single tracks was established using BP neural network, and the influence of process parameters on the cross section geometry was also analyzed. The results demonstrate that tin single tracks have a good size uniformity, with the standard deviation 0.0556 for cross section width and 0.0111 for cross section height. The cross section geometry of tin single tracks is fitted with ellipse function with a fitting degree 0.9956. For the cross section width and height of tin single tracks, the average error between experimental value and predicted value by the BP neural network model is as small as 2.42 and 3.75%, respectively.

In this work, a high-performance OCR method based on deep learning is proposed. First, the region of character string is segmented using semantic segmentation network, and the tilt angle of the string is corrected so that the system is adaptive to character rotation. Then the intervals between adjacent characters are recognized by a column-classification network so that characters in the same string are well separated. Finally, each region of separated character is fed to an image-classification network to ensure a high-accuracy recognition. Different from existing networks which carry out tasks of location and classification simultaneously, in the proposed framework three different networks including the semantic segmentation network, the column classification network and the image-classification network are independent. Each of them is dedicated to its own classification task so that the classification accuracy is best. Another advantage of this framework is that it is convenient to do data augmentation. Different from traditional OCR algorithm based on deep learning, which mainly need a large number of labeled samples, the proposed algorithm only needs 100 training samples with the size of 640 * 480 to achieve an accuracy of 99.92%, moreover, the whole detection process requires only about 78 ms per image on average.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-97304-3_78,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Prediction of the shop floor activities has a great potential to reduce manufacturing costs, by providing the information required for operational decisions like preventive maintenance, automatic remediation or scheduling optimization. Research has been focusing on how machine learning algorithms can be used to better understand and extract insights from historical data collected from manufacturing systems. However, in the current manufacturing environments, driven by mass customization and short time to market, these approaches fail to be agile enough to be useful. In this paper we propose a real-time machine learning approach for large scale manufacturing systems that can predict various scenarios before service degradation occurs, thus allowing for corrective actions.

In this paper, we take a machine learning perspective to choose the best model for defects prediction of sheet metal forming processes. An empirical study is presented with the objective to choose the best machine learning algorithm that will be able to perform accurately this task. For building the model, three distinct datasets were created using numerical simulation for three mild steel materials: mild steel, DH600, HSLA340. The numerical simulation was performed on the basis of sixteen input features representing characteristics of the materials. Moreover, two kinds of defects, springback and maximum thinning, each one is binary with 1 (defects) and 0 (non-defects) were considered in the simulator. The experimental setup consists of running MLP, CART, NB, RF and SVM algorithms using cross-validation for correctly choosing model parameters. The results were averaged in 30 runs and the standard deviations recorded.

Presented schemes were tested using artificial datasets generated by the benchmark of a longwall scraper conveyor. Model allows for testing various scenarios of operation modes of the conveyor, including the possibility of modelling operational faults.

Therefore, manufacturing systems work under uncertainty when their current state cannot be identified and which leads to some difficulties in determining the way of corrective control action. One of the critical stages in determining manufacturing system capacity is volume planning which, consequently, influences the whole system of division plans. The uncertainty in decision-making can be decreased with “advice” automated systems when Control Subjects are making agreed decisions. The research describes the problem of making agreed decisions for volume manufacturing plans. An automated technological process control system generates options of control actions, with experts analyzing and assessing them, then choosing the most feasible one with fuzzy sets.

Hence, various sensors such as pyrometers, photo diodes and matrix CCD detectors are used. The discrepancies in temperature measurements and the real temperature distribution inside the powder medium reduce the reliability of this method. The high resolution imaging monitors the quality post factum , after a part is manufactured. So far, no methods are known to monitor the quality of additive manufacturing in situ and in real-time. To achieve the goal of accurate real-time quality control, we propose an approach that relies on acoustic emission, which is further analyzed within artificial intelligence framework. We show that the additive manufacturing process has a number of unique acoustic signatures that can be detected, extracted and interpreted in terms of quality. In this contribution, the processing parameters for the selective laser melting of a 316L steel were modified to create a specimen consisting of sections with three quality levels. During the process, the acoustic emission data were acquired and then processed prior validation. The confidence level achieved in the classification is 79–84% that demonstrates the applicability of this approach for in situ and real-time quality monitoring in additive manufacturing.

This study investigates industrial water demand forecasting by case-based reasoning (CBR) in an arid area, with a case study of Zhangye, China. Case-based reasoning uses past experience to solve new problems. Since CBR is a methodology rather than a technique, this definition makes case-based reasoning system be an open system, which can constantly absorb new technologies and methods, and be more conducive to the development of itself. This research constructed a case base with 420 original cases of 28 cities in China, extracted six attributes of the industrial water demand, and employed a back propagation neural network (BPN) to weight each attribute, as well as the grey incidence analysis (GIA) to calculate the similarities between target case and original cases. The forecasting values were calculated by weighted similarities. The results show that the industrial water demand of Zhangye in 2030, which is the target case, will reach 11.9 million tons. There are ten original cases which have relatively high similarities to the target case. Furthermore, the case of Yinchuan, 2010, has the largest similarity, followed by Yinchuan, 2009, and Urumqi, 2009.

Second, domain experts are confronted with related monitoring data, e.g. temperature, vibration, video, audio etc., from different sources to assess and classify anomaly types. With an increasing knowledge base, a classifier module automatically suggests possible causes for an anomaly automatically in advance to support machine operators in the anomaly identification process.

In addition, the Decisions required commercial banks to establish an internal credit rating system that aligned with Basel Accord II of Basel Committee and Banking Supervision. In 2006, Bank for Development and Investment Vietnam (BIDV) officially adopted the new Internal Credit Rating System (ICRS), which is approved by the State Bank of Vietnam, and was consulted by Ernst & Young Audit firm. The IRCS includes 54 criteria (10 financial and 40 non-financial criteria) to asses a firm creditability. The ICRS is widely applied for the whole BIDV system including the head quarter and all level of BIDV branches. Credit analysts from different BIDV branches may have different point of view in assessing non-financial (qualitative) criteria and thus lead to different credit rating for the same company in the system. To disregard the difference between branches, this thesis is conducted using data that BIDV consider best practiced credit score rated by BIDV’s credit analyst, whose competence are equivalent and whose point of view mostly aligned with BIDV strategy. The research aims to investigate the most important ICRS criteria by using artificial learning machine method, specifically, the Artificial Neural Network. The researches primarily focused on analyzing the ICRS applied for economic organizations with the historical data collected from 33 companies from 14 industries in the year 2015. After a deliberate research process, the research has evaluated several constrains of the outstanding model aiming to constructively contribute for improvement in the future rating activities at BIDV.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-73150-6_59,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One of the most valid tasks in credit risk evaluation is the proper classification of potential good and bad customers. Reduction of the number of loans granted to companies of questionable credibility can significantly influence banks’ performance. An important element in credit risk assessment is a prior identification of factors which affect companies’ standing. The research focuses on determining which of the factors have the biggest impact on company’s solvency and which are redundant and therefore can be removed from future analysis. The other purpose of the research is to investigate and compare the results of two different structures of neural networks—the most common Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function neural network (RBF).

Data obtained by the Taguchi method are divided into input and output data for an ANN’s input and output parameters, respectively. The ANN trains itself to develop the relationship between its input and output parameters. The trained ANN is then integrated into a GA as the fitness function, such that the GA can evolutionarily obtain the optimal process parameters. The HERON is validated through a manufacturing process on soft-shell turtle soft-capsules. The objective is to minimize the soft-capsule defect rate. Compared to the defect rates obtained by the empirical and Taguchi methods, the HERON reduces the defect rate by 43.75 and 32.5 %, respectively.

Four layer FWNNs in the Dynamic structure FWNNs is constructed on the basis of fuzzy rules which associates with wavelet function in the consequent part, to compensate for structured and unstructured uncertainties and model complex processes. However, it is difficult to design a suitable control scheme to achieve the required approximation errors, such as friction forces, external disturbances error and parameter variations. To deal with the mentioned problems, all the parameters of the Dynamic structure FWNNs system are tuned on-line by an adaptive learning algorithm, and adaptive robust control laws are determined by Lyapunov stability theorem.

We describe a two-stage approach to predict travelers’ choice behavior by combining machine learning and discrete choice-modeling techniques. The applicability of these models is then illustrated by employing them for dynamic pricing optimization. We conduct experiments on a dataset extracted from searches and bookings on several European markets, aiming at assessing both the accuracy of our customer models and the effect of price optimization.

It combines feature extraction procedure with classification task together to achieve automated and intelligent fault diagnosis. The DBN model is built by stacking multiple-units of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and is trained using layer-by-layer pre-training algorithm. Compared with traditional diagnostic approaches where feature extraction is needed, the presented approach has the ability of learning hierarchical representations, which are suitable for fault classification, directly from frequency distribution of the measurement data. The structure of the DBN model is investigated as the scale and depth of the DBN architecture directly affect its classification performance.

These techniques can manufacture components from titanium alloys (such as Ti-6Al-4 V) for industries such as aerospace, medical, and automotive, etc. However, these techniques have their own limitations since they are not yet fully developed for many materials including Ti-6Al-4 V. For example, the RUM involves high machining time due to the extremely low MRR while EBM suffers with poor surface quality of final parts. Therefore, in this work, an attempt has been made to combine the additive (EBM) and subtractive (RUM) techniques. The two techniques have been integrated to overcome the limitations of one over the other. In fact, this research has aimed to minimize the surface roughness of EBM fabricated parts using RUM. The design of experiment (DOE) has been adopted to get the best combination of RUM parameters which produce a high surface finish for EBM parts. Moreover, the artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed to predict the surface roughness effectively. The machining parameters such as coolant pressure, frequency, spindle speed, depth of cut, feed rate, and power supply of RUM have been investigated for better surface finish.

In this paper, the authors proposed a polishing algorithm to deal with this problem using neural network (NNW) and genetic algorithm (GA). The NNW is used to predict the polishing performance parameters corresponding to a certain polishing parameters.

In this research, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is used to deposit 10 nm to 15 nm MgO single-crystal films on silicon carbide with hexagonal polytype 6H (6H-SiC) to serve as an interface layer for effective integration of functional oxides. In this work, the effect of MBE process control variables on the growth rate of the MgO film measured in nanometers per minute is investigated. Experiments are conducted at various process conditions and the resulting MgO film growth rate at each combination of process conditions is measured. The process control variables studied are the substrate temperature (100 °C – 300 °C), magnesium source temperature (328 °C – 350 °C), plasma intensity (0 mV – 550 mV), and percentage oxygen on the starting surface of 6H-SiC substrate (9 % – 13 %) after the substrate is prepared by high-temperature hydrogen etching. The film thickness is computed using the effective attenuation length (EAL) of silicon photoelectron peak intensity as measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The film thickness is converted to growth rate by dividing it with the duration of film growth. Using the experimental data, a neural network model is developed to estimate growth rate for any given process variable combination. From this neural network model, multiple replications of data were generated to conduct a 3-level full factorial design of experiments and response surface-based analysis. The study reveals that the plasma intensity has the most significant influence on growth rate. The results indicate that growth rate is relatively low on high-quality substrates with √3 × √3 R30° reconstructed 6H-SiC (0001) surface with optimum oxygen content (approximately 10 %); in contrast, the growth rate is relatively high on substrates with high surface roughness and excessive oxygen on the starting substrate surface.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-016-9674-1,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The disadvantage of these simulations is that they are very time consuming and their results do not help to fully understand the underlying process. For instance, a common problem in planning processes is the choice of an appropriate machine parameter set that results in desirable process outputs. One way to overcome this problem is to use data mining techniques that extract previously unknown but valuable knowledge from simulation results. This paper presents a hybrid machine learning approach for applying clustering and classification techniques in a laser cutting planning process. In a first step, a clustering algorithm is used to divide large parts of the simulation data into groups of similar performance values and select those groups that are of major interest (e.g. high cut quality results). Next, classification trees are used to identify regions in the multidimensional parameter space that are related to the found groups. The evaluation shows that the models accurately identify multidimensional relationships between the input parameters and the output values of the process. In addition to that, a combination of appropriate visualization techniques for clustering with interpretable classification trees allows designers to gain valuable insights into the laser cutting process with the aim of optimizing it through visual exploration.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11740-017-0718-7,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1631/FITEE.1601540,NIPAD: a non-invasive power-based anomaly detection scheme for programmable logic controllers,Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering,10.1631/FITEE.1601540,Springer,2017-04-01,"Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures, making them popular targets for attacks to cause catastrophic physical damage. As one of the most critical components in ICSs, the programmable logic controller (PLC) controls the actuators directly. A PLC executing a malicious program can cause significant property loss or even casualties. The number of attacks targeted at PLCs has increased noticeably over the last few years, exposing the vulnerability of the PLC and the importance of PLC protection. Unfortunately, PLCs cannot be protected by traditional intrusion detection systems or antivirus software. Thus, an effective method for PLC protection is yet to be designed. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a non-invasive powerbased anomaly detection scheme for PLCs. The basic idea is to detect malicious software execution in a PLC through analyzing its power consumption, which is measured by inserting a shunt resistor in series with the CPU in a PLC while it is executing instructions. To analyze the power measurements, we extract a discriminative feature set from the power trace, and then train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network with the features of normal samples to predict the next time step of a normal sample. Finally, an abnormal sample is identified through comparing the predicted sample and the actual sample. The advantages of our method are that it requires no software modification on the original system and is able to detect unknown attacks effectively. The method is evaluated on a lab testbed, and for a trojan attack whose difference from the normal program is around 0.63%, the detection accuracy reaches 99.83%.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1631/FITEE.1601540,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

New developments for control strategies such as artificial neural networks and model-based controls as well as their applications have brought several new prospects to the food industry. Food processes are mostly nonlinear and show different process dynamics with various raw materials and different processing conditions. Therefore, advanced process control techniques are highly invaluable compared to classical control approaches. In this review, advanced control strategies, particularly model-based controllers, fuzzy logic controllers, and neural network-based controllers, are firstly described with their main characteristics. A number of applications of the advanced control strategies are then discussed according to different food processing industries such as baking, drying, fermentation/brewing, dairy, and thermal/pressure food processing.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11947-016-1831-x,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

One example is the representation of dispatching and scheduling strategies of production jobs. When generating a model automatically, the underlying rules for these strategies are typically unknown but yet have to be adequately emulated.

The bearings are installed deep into the home appliances at the beginning of the production process and cannot be physically accessed once they are fully assembled. Before a home appliance is put to sale, it is turned on and passed through a sound-based sensor that produces an acoustic signal. Home appliances with defective embedded bearings are detected by analyzing such signals. The approached task is very challenging, mainly because there is a small number of sample signals and the noise level in the measurements is quite high. In fact, it is showed that the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough to mask important components when applying traditional Fourier decomposition techniques. Hence, a different approach is needed. Experimental results are reported on both laboratory and production line signals. Despite the difficulty of the task, these results are encouraging.

Article,doi:10.1007/s10845-014-0972-x,An artificial intelligence model to estimate the fat addition ratio for the mixing process in the animal feed industry,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,10.1007/s10845-014-0972-x,Springer,2017-01-01,"In animal feed pellets, the fat content is obtained either from the feed ingredients or is directly added during processing. Additional fat is required when the fat level in the feed ingredients is less than the desired level. This fat can be added either during the mixing process or after the pelleting process. However, adding fat at different time leads to different results. The addition of an increasing amount of fat during the mixing process decreases the pellet durability but enhances the pellet production rate. To avoid a reduction in the pellet durability, limiting the inclusion of fats in the mixer is suggested. The use of suitable fat addition ratios during mixing and after pelleting can improve the pellet quality and the production capability. Many factors significantly affect the decision of how much fat to add, such as the fiber inclusion content in the feed formulation, pellet die size, required feed durability, total required fat, and required additional fat. Due to frequent changes in the feed mix, anticipating the suitable amount of fat addition during the mixing process becomes a cumbersome task for a mill. In this paper, a model for estimating the amount of fat required in the mixer for each feed formulation is proposed. The model is based on the local linear map (LLM) and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The LLM is used to identify which feed formulations require the addition of fat both during mixing and after pelleting, whereas the BPNN is employed for estimating the proper total fat required in the mixer, and the ratio of fat to add during the mixing process is subsequently estimated by subtracting the fat in the raw material from the total fat required in the mixer. The model is developed using data from one the largest feed mills in Thailand. The proposed model provides an accurate prediction and is practical for implementation in the mill that was studied.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-014-0972-x,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In IoT-based predictive computation, the predictive model performs the predictions of future observations. The prediction of data includes point-wise or interval-wise predictions, prediction regions or prediction analysis based on the distribution of data, and ranking method for new observations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-5107-4_5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Computing accurately sentiment expressed in huge amount of textual data is a key task largely required by the market, and nowadays industrial engines make available ready-to-use APIs for sentiment analysis-related tasks. However, building sentiment engines showing high accuracy on structurally different textual sources (e.g. reviews, tweets, blogs, etc.) is not a trivial task. Papers about cross-source evaluation lack of a comparison with industrial engines, which are instead specifically designed for dealing with multiple sources. In this paper, we compare the results of research and industrial engines on an extensive experimental evaluation, considering the document-level polarity detection task performed on different textual sources: tweets, apps reviews and general products reviews, in both English and Italian. The experimental evaluation results help the reader to quantify the performance gap between industrial and research sentiment engines when both are tested on heterogeneous textual sources and on different languages (English/Italian). Finally, we present the results of our multi-source solution X2Check. Considering an overall cross-source average F-score on all of the results, X2Check shows a performance that is 9.1% and 5.1% higher than Google CNL, respectively on Italian and English benchmarks. Compared to the research engines, X2Check shows a F-score that is always higher than tools not specifically trained on the test set under evaluation; it is lower at most of 3.4% in Italian and 11.6% on English benchmarks, compared to the best research tools specifically trained on the target source.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-70169-1_11,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Satisfactory results can be found in the literature, in both forming and machining operations, regarding the use of a neural network as a predictive tool. Nevertheless, the research of the optimal network configuration is still based on trial-and-error approaches, rather than on the application of specific techniques . As a consequence, the best method to determine the optimal neural network configuration is still a lack of knowledge in the literature overview. According to that, a comparative analysis is proposed in this work. More in detail four different approaches have been used to increase the generalization abilities of a neural network. These methods are based, respectively, on the use of genetic algorithms, Taguchi, tabu search and decision trees. The parameters taken into account in this work are the training algorithm, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons and the activation function of each hidden layer. These techniques have been firstly tested on three different datasets, generated through numerical simulations in the Deform2D environment, in an attempt to map the input–output relationship for an extrusion, a rolling and a shearing process. Subsequently, the same approach has been validated on a fourth dataset derived from the literature review for a complex industrial process to widely generalize and asses the proposed methodology in the whole manufacturing field. Four tests were carried out for each dataset modifying the original data with a random noise with zero mean and standard deviation of one, two and five per cent.

Thus, measuring and analyzing of vibration rate in gas turbines is very important and knowing about its operational conditions and prediction of this phenomenon can help a lot in reducing vibration, avoiding damage to the blades and eventually financial savings. In this paper, we are modelling the vibration rate of a real double shaft 25 MW gas turbine, located in Iran, by making use of a hybrid intelligent model based on multi-layer perceptron neural network and cuckoo optimization algorithm; so, the model in this paper is abbreviated as MLP-COA. It should be noted that this work is an absolutely novel work and the idea is implemented in a real turbine for first time. We have used a real dataset with 161 samples which are collected during a year from a gas turbine in a gas pressure booster station. Furthermore, to obtain the effect of each input parameter on the vibration rate, we have applied sensitivity analysis using the cosine amplitude technique. Evaluation of predicted vibration rates was performed and prove satisfactory efficiency of this model than other predictive models such as radial basis function and multi-layer perceptron.

Several studies propose automating bug assignment techniques using machine learning in open source software contexts, but no study exists for large-scale proprietary projects in industry. The goal of this study is to evaluate automated bug assignment techniques that are based on machine learning classification. In particular, we study the state-of-the-art ensemble learner Stacked Generalization (SG) that combines several classifiers. We collect more than 50,000 bug reports from five development projects from two companies in different domains. We implement automated bug assignment and evaluate the performance in a set of controlled experiments. We show that SG scales to large scale industrial application and that it outperforms the use of individual classifiers for bug assignment, reaching prediction accuracies from 50 % to 89 % when large training sets are used. In addition, we show how old training data can decrease the prediction accuracy of bug assignment. We advice industry to use SG for bug assignment in proprietary contexts, using at least 2,000 bug reports for training.

Recently, various machine learning techniques (e.g., artificial neural network, support vector machine, support vector regression or decision tree) have been used as an effective tool to monitor process mean vector and covariance matrix shifts. However, most of these machine learning techniques-based approaches for process mean vector and covariance matrix have been developed separately in literature with the other parameter assumed to be under control. Little attention has been given to simultaneous monitoring of process mean vector and covariance matrix shifts. In addition, these approaches cannot provide more detailed shift information, for example the shift magnitude, which would be greatly useful for quality practitioners to search the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. This study presents a hybrid ensemble learning-based model for simultaneous monitoring of process mean vector and covariance matrix shifts. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model can effectively detect and recognize not only mean vector or covariance matrix shifts but also mixed situations where mean vector and covariance matrix shifts exist concurrently. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the shift of each of the shifted quality characteristics can be accurately quantified. Empirical comparisons also show that the proposed model performs better than other existing approaches in detecting mean vector and covariance matrix shifts, while also providing the capability of recognition of shift types and quantification of shift magnitudes.

These control schemes are to implement on a class of industrial complicated systems, as long as the traditional related cases are not to guarantee the desired tracking performance, efficiently. In reality, the research proposed here, in its present form, outlines the achieved results of the control schemes, which are all organized based on both the multiple models strategy and the linear model based predictive control approach, as well. In one such case, the outcomes are focused on an industrial tubular heat exchanger system, which has so many applicabilities in real and academic environments. The traditional schemes are almost implemented on the system to control the outlet temperature of the inner tube by either the temperature or the flow of the fluid flowing, concurrently, through the shell tube. In some situations, the appropriate control scheme realization is not possible, due to the fact that the whole of system coefficients variation cannot quite be covered by the control action. In case of the matter presented, the techniques need to be organized, which the tracking performance both in the system coefficients and also in the desired set point variations could acceptably be guaranteed. Hereinafter, the performance mentioned and also the weight of realization of each one of the proposed control schemes have been surveyed, while all of them are presented in shortened version and therefore their details are not thoroughly given here. In such a case, some schemes are now available in the corresponding research, that are fully referenced, in the present investigation. In agreement with the acquired results, the validity of the control schemes are tangibly verified and also compared with respect to each other.

Thus, based on the outputs of deep processing of these data, manufacturing enterprises have the potential to respond rapidly to the changing customer needs and markets under the dynamic environment of multi-site design and cloud manufacturing, which is becoming a core competitiveness of enterprises. However, due to a large amount of data scattered in various distributed databases or clouds of enterprises has not yet been exploited effectively, this valuable competence gained from mass customization is still not practically available in the modern manufacturing industry. In order to provide a feasible treatment for mass customization in product design under cloud manufacturing environment, the three critical problems identified in this paper must be solved comprehensively. Thus, this research has proposed a novel integrated solution (named “KAGFM”) to realize effective mass customization for customer-oriented product design in an intelligent computerized manner based on big data mining, that is, manufacturing enterprises can adjust product design schemes keenly adapting with the specific requirements of a certain group of customers. By taking advantage of the cloud manufacturing, this solution can extract a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules from huge quantities of raw data through integrating the artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), and fuzzy rules seamlessly together to precisely extract and express semantic relationships between individual data sets (including personal attributes and preferences) and key product design elements. This paper tests and evaluates the proposed solution through a case study on mass customization for concept mobile phone design.

One example of these processes is ball-end finishing of inclined surfaces, which is a very complex task, due to the high number of variables that may influence dimensional errors during a cutting process and their different nature.

Secondly, it goes on to analyse the possibilities of artificial neural networks as a means of overcoming this limitation. Two types of neural networks, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis functions (RBF), are tested. The results show that RBFs predict better than MLPs in all cases, achieving a precision of 1.83 μm in root mean squared error (RMSE) and a correlation coefficient of 0.897 with a 10 × 10 cross-validation scheme.

Such simulation tools help answer “what-if” questions, and a materials engineer may have to conduct a number of simulations for decision making. In practice the engineer is often seeking a solution to an “inverse problem”, i.e., prediction of inputs/process parameters for a desired outcome. Such an inverse problem is often solved by formulating it as a constrained-optimization problem. Extensive simulation in the input-parameter space when performing the optimization is avoided by approximate response surfaces iteratively constructed using simulations executed while traversing the design space. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of machine learning techniques to address such inverse problems. Specifically, using data from physics-based simulations, we explore the use of two different kinds of models constructed by machine learning. The first approach constructs a “generative” model (a Bayesian network), from which input values can be obtained directly from output values, without the need of an optimization step. It does however need additional knowledge in the form of conditional (in)-dependences between process parameters, intermediate state variables, and outputs. The second is a purely predictive machine learning model capturing complex non-linearity followed by the use of optimization methods (simulated annealing) for inverse prediction. We present results for modelling of a heat treatment process chain involving carburization, quenching and tempering. Our findings are as follows: For the range of output-values we examined, the predictive model performs better than the generative model. However the generative model has the ability to discover multiple solutions to the inverse problem, unlike in the traditional response-surface-based design of experiments. Thus the generative approach may prove more useful for exploratory industrial practice in the long run.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-48170-8_31,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A minimum quantity lubrication scheme was employed to minimize the amount of cutting oil used, thereby minimizing the associated process cost. Four process variables or cutting conditions (cutting speed, depth of cut, feed rate, and flow rate) were selected for the specific cutting energy model, and their appropriate ranges were determined through a preliminary experiment. The specific cutting energy model was developed based on an artificial neural network, where the Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm was implemented and the number of hidden layers was determined through comparison with controlled experimental data. The cutting conditions to minimize the specific cutting energy were determined using a global optimization process-the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

Most schema matching tools are semi-automatic, e.g., an expert must tune certain parameters (thresholds, weights, etc.). They mainly use aggregation methods to combine similarity measures. The tuning of a matcher, especially for its aggregation function, has a strong impact on the matching quality of the resulting correspondences, and makes it difficult to integrate a new similarity measure or to match specific domain schemas. In this paper, we present YAM (Yet Another Matcher), a matcher factory which enables the generation of a dedicated schema matcher for a given schema matching scenario. For this purpose we have formulated the schema matching task as a classification problem. Based on this machine learning framework, YAM automatically selects and tunes the best method to combine similarity measures (e.g., a decision tree, an aggregation function). In addition, we describe how user inputs, such as a preference between recall or precision, can be closely integrated during the generation of the dedicated matcher. Many experiments run against matchers generated by YAM and traditional matching tools confirm the benefits of a matcher factory and the significant impact of user preferences.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-662-49534-6_5,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the material limits of additive manufacturing, it is clear that purely geometric replicas are unlikely to create violins of comparable sound. We propose a “surrogate” system approach, which tailors some combination of a structure’s material and geometric properties to mimic the performance of a target system. Finite element (FE) methods can approximate the vibrational performance of a violin or similar structure with high precision, given its specific physical properties and geometry. Surrogate systems, however, require the solution of the inverse problem. This can be achieved through artificial neural networks (ANN), a powerful tool for non-linear function estimation. As a stepping-stone to the violin problem, we first developed a surrogate method for simple beam structures. A neural network was trained on 7500 randomized beams to predict a thickness profile for a set of desired mode shapes and frequencies. Numerical simulation shows surrogates with good performance (<8 % modal error, <18 % frequency error) for target structures with a similar degree of thickness variation to that used in training the neural network. Performance improves dramatically (<2 % modal error, <7 % frequency error) for slightly less complex target structures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-319-30249-2_18,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In recent years, many machine learning techniques [e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machine (SVM)] have been successfully used to the CCP recognition (CCPR) in autocorrelated manufacturing processes. However, these existing researches can only detect and classify unnatural CCPs but do not provide more detailed process information, for example the autocorrelation level, which would be very useful for quality practitioners to search the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. This study proposes a neural network ensemble-enabled autoregressive coefficient-invariant CCPR model for on-line recognition of seven typical types of unnatural CCP, assuming that the process observations are AR(1) correlated over time with unknown constant autoregressive coefficient. In this model, each individual back propagation network (BPN) is trained to recognize only CCPs with the specific autoregressive coefficient of the underlying process, while the outputs of all these individual BPNs are combined via a learning vector quantization network (LVQN). The experimental results indicate that the proposed CCPR model can not only accurately recognize the specific CCP types but also efficiently identify the autoregressive coefficient of the underlying autocorrelated manufacturing process. Empirical comparisons also show that the proposed CCPR model outperform other existing CCPR approaches in literature. In addition, a demonstrative application is provided to illustrate the utilization of the proposed CCPR model to the CCPR in autocorrelated manufacturing processes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-013-0847-6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Experimental determination of the adsorption capacity of diverse chemicals onto carbon is both time and resource intensive, and development of computational approaches has widely been advocated. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI)-based ten different qualitative and quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models (MLPN, RBFN, PNN/GRNN, CCN, SVM, GEP, GMDH, SDT, DTF, DTB) were established for the prediction of the adsorption capacity of structurally diverse chemicals to activated carbon following the OECD guidelines. Structural diversity of the chemicals and nonlinear dependence in the data were evaluated using the Tanimoto similarity index and Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman statistics. The generalization and prediction abilities of the constructed models were established through rigorous internal and external validation procedures performed employing a wide series of statistical checks. In complete dataset, the qualitative models rendered classification accuracies between 97.04 and 99.93 %, while the quantitative models yielded correlation ( R ^2) values of 0.877–0.977 between the measured and the predicted endpoint values. The quantitative prediction accuracies for the higher molecular weight (MW) compounds (class 4) were relatively better than those for the low MW compounds. Both in the qualitative and quantitative models, the Polarizability was the most influential descriptor. Structural alerts responsible for the extreme adsorption behavior of the compounds were identified. Higher number of carbon and presence of higher halogens in a molecule rendered higher binding affinity. Proposed QSPR models performed well and outperformed the previous reports. A relatively better performance of the ensemble learning models (DTF, DTB) may be attributed to the strengths of the bagging and boosting algorithms which enhance the predictive accuracies.

However, most conventional multivariate control charts share the same problem: they can only detect an out-of-control circumstance but cannot directly point out which variable or group of variables has caused the out-of-control signal. This study proposes an effective MSPC model enabled by two-level discrete particle swarm optimization-based selective ensemble of learning vector quantization networks (DPSOSENLVQ) for monitoring and diagnosing of mean shifts in multivariate manufacturing processes. In this model, one DPSOSENLVQ is developed for detecting out-of-control signals in process mean, while the other DPSOSENLVQ is developed for further classifying the detected out-of-control signals as one of the specific mean shift types. The experimental result indicates that the proposed MSPC model can not only efficiently monitor the process state but also accurately diagnose the detected out-of-control signals. Empirical comparisons also showed that the proposed MSPC model outperformed other existing approaches in literature. In addition, a case study is conducted to demonstrate how the proposed MSPC model can function as an effective tool for monitoring and diagnosing of mean shifts in multivariate manufacturing processes.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-013-0833-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Artificial intelligence, as a new approach, can be used to predict the complex phenomenon such as hearing loss. Using artificial neural networks, this study aims to present an empirical model for the prediction of the hearing loss threshold among noise-exposed workers. Methods Two hundred and ten workers employed in a steel factory were chosen, and their occupational exposure histories were collected. To determine the hearing loss threshold, the audiometric test was carried out using a calibrated audiometer. The personal noise exposure was also measured using a noise dosimeter in the workstations of workers. Finally, data obtained five variables, which can influence the hearing loss, were used for the development of the prediction model. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks with different structures were developed using MATLAB software. Neural network structures had one hidden layer with the number of neurons being approximately between 5 and 15 neurons. Results The best developed neural networks with one hidden layer and ten neurons could accurately predict the hearing loss threshold with RMSE = 2.6 dB and R ^2 = 0.89. The results also confirmed that neural networks could provide more accurate predictions than multiple regressions. Conclusions Since occupational hearing loss is frequently non-curable, results of accurate prediction can be used by occupational health experts to modify and improve noise exposure conditions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00420-014-1004-z,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the high cost of raw materials severely impairs its economy and utilization. In this study, agro-industrial by-products, i.e., fish meal coupled with corn steep liquor, were employed as alternative organic nitrogen sources for industrial ε-PL production by Streptomyces sp. M-Z18. An economical medium was then developed by using an artificial neural network. Amino acids analyses showed that the improved medium was rich in glutamate, arginine, lysine and aspartate, which not only elevated the acid tolerance capability of the mycelia but also enhanced cell growth and ε-PL production. Subsequently, a cost-effective and efficient strategy for ε-PL production was established on fermenter scale, based on the improved medium and two-stage pH control. Notably, ε-PL production and productivity reached 35.24 g/L and 4.85 g/L day in fed-batch fermentation. Further profit assessment at the 10 m^3 scale indicated that application of this strategy resulted in a net profit increase of 9,057 USD.

The primary function of a condition monitoring system is to check the existence of the tool before starting any machining process and ensure its health during operation. The aim of this study is to assess the detection of the existence of the tool in the spindle and its health (i.e. normal or broken) using infrared and vision systems as a non-contact methodology. The suggested technique is based on ‘learning from experience’ concept. The application of principal component analysis (PCA) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) combined with neural networks is investigated using both types of data in order to establish an effective and reliable novel software program for tool tracking and health recognition. Infrared and visual cameras are used to locate and track the cutting tool during the machining process using suitable analysis and image processing algorithms. The capabilities of PCA and DWT combined with neural networks are investigated in recognising the tool’s condition by comparing the characteristics of the tool to those of known conditions in the training set. The experimental results have shown high performance when using the infrared data in comparison to visual images for the selected image and signal processing algorithms for these suggested self-learning techniques.,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-014-6576-y,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The current research was an effort to evaluate performance of a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) treating combined municipal and industrial wastewater and to simulate effluent quality parameters of the SMBR using a radial basis function artificial neural network (RBFANN). The results showed that the treatment efficiencies increase and hydraulic retention time (HRT) decreases for combined wastewater compared with municipal and industrial wastewaters.

Curing the adhesive simultaneously with solder reflow helps simplify the assembly process and reduces the manufacturing cost. When a low soldering temperature profile is used, the impact on the adhesion performance of the cured adhesive becomes a major concern. This research investigates the influence of adhesive dispensing process parameters on the shear strength of 0805 chip capacitors.

Therefore, certain readily available tools are required which can deal with such uncertain situations arising out of industrial sickness. It is more significant for a country like India where the fruits of developments are rarely equally distributed. In this paper, we propose an approach based on certain soft-computational tools specially using Artificial neural network (ANN) to deal with industrial sickness with specific focus on a few such units taken from a less-developed northeast (NE) Indian state like Assam. More specifically, we here propose, a soft-computational tool which formulates certain decision support mechanism to decide upon industrial sickness using eight different parameters which are directly related to the stages of sickness of such units. The mechanism primarily identifies a few stages of industrial health using various inputs provided in terms of the eight identified parameters. This decision is further compared with the results obtained from another set of ANNs where the model uses certain signals and symptoms of industrial health to decide upon the state of a unit. Specifically, we train multiple ANN blocks with data obtained from a few selected units of Assam so that required decisions related to industrial health could be taken.

There is a need for new approaches that are able to cope with this complexity and high-dimensionality which, at the same time, are able to generate applicable results with reasonable effort. Within this paper, the possibility to generate such a system by applying a combination of Cluster Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning on product state data along the manufacturing programme will be presented. After elaborating on the different key aspects of the approach, the applicability on the identified problem in industrial environment will be discussed briefly.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-013-0761-y,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Wafer fabrication (fab) performance evaluations are important for examining past operations such as the capacity and resource allocation. In addition, forecasting provides useful information for what-if analyses to anticipate useful strategies early to avoid potential losses. However, the integration of performance evaluation and forecast based on a consideration of the relative performance along the time horizon has rarely been addressed. In particular, the part of performance evaluation is to generate the relative performance in a period with rolling data. Then, the forecast part is to build a model for performance prediction based on the result of present performance. This study aimed to construct a performance forecast model by integrating data envelopment analysis and a back-propagation neural network for performance evaluation and forecast, respectively. Empirical data from a leading semiconductor company in Taiwan was used to test the proposed model. The results provide basic information and early alarms to adjust the resource allocation before the future performance declines.

Nevertheless, the price of silver has increased dramatically in recent years. This study evaluates the feasibility of replacing the commonly used SAC305 with low cost SnCuNi (Sn99.25/Cu0.7/Ni0.05/Ge; SCN) solder alloy in wave soldering for high layer count printed circuit board.

The objective of this research is to investigate manufacturing issues and propose an optimal process. Process parameters such as soldering temperature and dwell time are determined to achieve the desired quality levels. Multiple quality characteristics, namely assembly yield and solder joint pull strength, are considered. Thus, this study compares two approaches, integration of principal component analysis/grey relational analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) combined with genetic algorithms (GA), to resolve the problems of multiple quality characteristics. The results of verification test shows that samples prepared with the process scenario suggested by the ANN combined with GA are superior.

However, the recent RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to lack of systematic control methodologies. Therefore, this study aims to develop a control module to obtain good quality joints of RLW by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model consisting of two stages, fault detections and parameter adjustments. A certain combination of parameters value, such as melting temperature, part type and thickness, laser power, and welding speed, is used as an input for the network in the first stage. The first network can recognize the fault patterns and gives an estimated faults type as an output. Then, the second stage performs sensitivity analysis of output faults and generation of adjustment rules, resulting in parameters adjustment rules as the final output.

In manufacturing industries, it is currently also becoming a topic of high practical relevance. A well-known challenge in most model generation approaches is the correct reproduction of the dynamic behaviour of model elements, for example, buffering or control strategies. This problem is especially relevant in simulation-based manufacturing control. In such scenarios, simulation models need to reflect the current state and behaviour of the real system in a highly accurate way, otherwise its suggested control decisions may be inaccurate or even dangerous towards production goals. This paper introduces a novel methodology for approximating dynamic behaviour using artificial neural networks, rather than trying to determine exact representations. We suggest using neural networks in conjunction with traditional material flow simulation systems whenever a certain decision cannot be made ex ante in the model generation process due to insufficient knowledge about the behaviour of the real system. In such cases the decision is delegated to the neural network, which is connected to the simulation system at runtime. Training of the neural network is performed by observation of the real systems decision and based on the evaluation of data that can be gained through production data acquisition. Our approach has certain advantages compared to other approaches and is especially well suited in the context of on-line simulation and simulation-based operational decision support. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology using a case study and report on performance results.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1057/jos.2013.6,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the high drying costs, increased temperatures are being used commonly in plywood industry to reduce the overall drying time and increase capacity. However, high drying temperatures can alter some physical, mechanical and chemical characteristics of wood and cause some drying-related defects. In this study, it was attempted to predict the optimum drying temperature for beech and spruce veneers via artificial neural network modeling for optimum bonding. Therefore, bonding shear strength values of plywood panels manufactured from beech and spruce veneers dried at temperatures of 20, 110, 150 and 180 °C were obtained experimentally. Then, the intermediate bond strength values based on veneer drying temperatures were predicted by artificial neural network modeling, and the values not measured experimentally were evaluated.

The findings of our research show that the most important perceived benefits of adopting machine learning algorithms for defect prediction are accuracy of predictions and ability to generate new insights from data. The two most important perceived barriers in this context are inability to recognize new patterns and low generalizability of the machine learning algorithms.

The steel industry is one example. Several automatic surface-inspection systems are used in the steel industry to identify various types of defects and to help operators decide whether to accept, reroute, or downgrade the material, subject to the assessment process. This paper focuses on promoting a strategy that considers all defects in an integrated fashion. It does this by managing the uncertainty about the exact position of a defect due to different process conditions by means of Gaussian additive influence functions. The relevance of the approach is in making possible consistency and reliability between surface inspection systems. The results obtained are an increase in confidence in the automatic inspection system and an ability to introduce improved prediction and advanced routing models. The prediction is provided to technical operators to help them in their decision-making process. It shows the increase in improvement gained by reducing the 40 % of coils that are downgraded at the hot strip mill because of specific defects. In addition, this technology facilitates an increase of 50 % in the accuracy of the estimate of defect survival after the cleaning facility in comparison to the former approach.

Even after having been used for several years in mineral processing plants, the full potential of the column flotation process is still not fully exploited. There is no prediction of process performance for the complete use of available control capabilities. The online estimation of grade usually requires a significant amount of work in maintenance and calibration of on-stream analyzers in order to maintain good accuracy and high availability. These difficulties and the high cost of investment and maintenance of these devices have encouraged the approach of prediction of metal grade. Therefore, advanced new methods such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) must be employed. In this paper,a new approach has been proposed for metallurgical performance prediction in flotation columns using ANN. Furthermore, a case study is carried out in an industrial Metso Minerals CISA flotation column (4 m in diameter and 12 m in height) at the Sarcheshmeh Copper Concentrator Plant. The values of Cu and Mo grades in the flotation feed and final concentrate, froth height, wash water, and the air and non-floated fraction flow rates were used for the simulation by ANN. Feed-forward ANNs with 3-13-6-1 and 4-4-8-1 arrangements were used to estimating Cu and Mo grades, respectively. The correlation coefficient values for the training and testing sets for Cu and Mo grades were 0.94 and 0.93 and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The results discussed in this paper indicate that the proposed model can be used to predict the Cu and Mo grades with a reasonable error. Also, analysis demonstrates that prediction of grade for optimizing and controlling column flotation for a wide range of operating conditions is highly effective.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s13369-012-0350-y,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A result oriented company will not invest resources to fuel interesting solutions but only to increase the performance, quality and/or efficiency of products and processes. The return on investment has to be clear and fast. In consequence the justification of not only of an implementation but of a working integration process is a must have for a return on investment.

We leverage the use of ontology tools, such as Protégé, to obtain the functionality of an EDMS. Our method complements and details the On-To-Knowledge methodology during its ontology development phase. The essential point of our method is to make it easy to develop an EDMS for quality standards by means of an ontology-based system.

On-site wind speed measurements are correlated to meteorological reanalysis data, which represent the best historical estimate available for the atmospheric state. The different variants of MCP more or less correct the statistical main attributes by making the meteorological reanalyses bias and scaling free using the on-site measurements. However, by neglecting the higher order correlations none of the variants utilize the full potential of the measurements. We show that deep neural networks make use of these higher order correlations. Our implementation is tailored to the requirements of MCP in the context of wind resource assessment. We show the application of this method to a set of different locations and compare the results to a simple linear fit to the wind speed frequency distribution as well as to a standard linear regression MCP, that represents the state-of-the-art in industrial aerodynamics. The neural network based MCP outperforms both other methods with respect to correlation, root-mean-square error and the distance in the wind speed frequency distribution.

Owing to the lengthy wafer fabrication process, work in process (WIP) usually affects the cycle time and throughput in the semiconductor fabrication. As the applications of semiconductor have reached the era of consumer electronics, time to market has played an increasingly critical role in maintaining a competitive advantage for a semiconductor company. Many past studies have explored how to reduce the time of scheduling and dispatching in the production cycle. Focusing on real settings, this study aims to develop a manufacturing intelligence approach by integrating Gauss-Newton regression method and back-propagation neural network as basic model to forecast the cycle time of the production line, where WIP, capacity, utilization, average layers, and throughput are rendered as input factors for indentifying effective rules to control the levels of the corresponding factors as well as reduce the cycle time. Additionally, it develops an adaptive model for rapid response to change of production line status.

Each of episodes is characterized by controlled and measured signals. An episode which is similar to the present period and which is characterized by the best possible value of quality criterion is being selected and becomes a pattern for control of the present production.

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is trained using these experimental error characteristics for estimation of the error.

The methods presented in literature are of two types: detailed–analysis- and parametric-based approaches. The former require that a lot of data, related to the kinematic and dynamic performance of the machine, should be known. Parametric models, on the other hand, are of general use and relatively simple to implement; however, the parametric methods presented in literature only provide a few of the components of the total build time. Therefore, their performances are not properly suited in any case. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a parametric approach which uses a more complete set of build-time driving factors. Furthermore, considering the complexity of the parametric build time function, an artificial neural network is used so as to improve the method flexibility. The analysis of the test cases shows that the proposed approach provides a quite accurate estimation of build time even in critical cases and when supports are required.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00170-011-3284-8,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Generally, it causes heavy computational load when calculating the compensating value within a short sampling period. In this paper, integrated recurrent neural networks are applied as a feedforward controller for PUMA560 manipulator. The feedforward controller works instead of gravity and Coriolis/centrifugal force compensators. In the learning process of the neural network by using back propagation algorithm, the learning coefficient and gain of sigmoid function are tuned intuitively and empirically according to teaching signals. The tuning is complicated because it is being conducted by trial and error. Especially, when the scale of teaching signal is large, the problem becomes crucial.

The industrial manufacturing process has been enhanced for optimized insertion of pigments in rigid films with regard to size, type, and density. The pigments are activated with infrared or ultraviolet light in an encapsulated laboratory system specially developed here. Filter on illumination sources and colour cameras limit the activation and the emission range.

The common method adopted in industry is to use a qualified image as a template image to inspect each live image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In this paper, a tolerance method is presented to replace the template image method. The said tolerance is formed by two indices computed from a sample image, instead of using the whole image for inspection. To ensure an accurate tolerance zone, a neural networks method is used to take the noise and uncertainties in the images under inspection into consideration. To improve neural networks training speed, the Taguchi method is adopted to select a minimum number of the sample images needed for training. Once a tolerance zone is obtained, live images are inspected against it. If the indices of a live image fall inside the tolerance zone, the part is regarded as good, otherwise defective. Three examples are given: one for auto part inspection, one for label inspection, and one for machining part inspection.

Applications can be found in a wide context ranging from medicine to finance, from human factors to consumer products, from vehicle control to computational linguistics, and so on (Wang 1997; Dubois and Prade 2000; Passino and Yurkovich 1998; Jang et al. 1997; Sugeno 1985; Pedrycz 1993). However, one of the shortcomings of fuzzy logic is the lack of systematic design. To circumvent this problem, fuzzy logic is usually combined with Neural Networks (NNs) by virtue of the learning capability of NNs. NNs are networks of highly interconnected neural computing elements that have the ability of responding to input stimuli and learning to adapt to the environment. Both fuzzy systems and NNs are dynamic and parallel processing systems that estimate input-output functions (Mitra and Hayashi 2000). The merits of both fuzzy and neural systems can be integrated in Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNNs) (Lee and Lee 1974, 1975; Pal and Mitra 1999; Zanchettin and Ludermir 2003). Therefore, the integration of fuzzy and neural systems leads to a symbiotic relationship in which fuzzy systems provide a powerful framework for expert knowledge representation, while NNs provide learning capabilities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-77465-5_3,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Significant variables in the selection of a clothing plant location will be identified and input into the proposed decision-making model. A suitability index was computed for each site. The sites with higher suitability indices were more appropriate for the establishment of a clothing plant.

The intrinsic and latent dangers of neural nets (within a control framework) are often overlooked when assessing a suitable technology for real-time control application. This case study examines the intrinsic properties of a neural net that make it wholly unsuitable as a technology directly or indirectly involved in the manipulation of process valves. Of particular concern is the optimization of product grade transitions. Apart from start up and shutdown, product grade transitions are the most safety critical procedures performed on a manufacturing plant. Any control system involved in the automation of such procedures should be of the highest integrity and adhere to sound, intrinsically safe control engineering principles—something neural networks categorically fail to provide. The objectives of this case study are twofold. Firstly, the aim is to raise awareness in the manufacturing industry of the inherent and latent dangers of neural networks in control.

The limitations of adaptive resonance theory in unsupervised artificial neural networks will be demonstrated. A comparison of the performance of the three types of supervised artificial neural networks – including back propagation, learning vector quantization and probabilistic neural network – is used and the proposed classification decision model will be presented.

An inappropriate decision on site selection can cause adverse affects on productivity and increase manufacturing and logistical costs. Manufacturers often face with difficulties during the decision-making process, due to vague and subjective considerations. The process is hampered with variables that cannot be represented in terms of objective values, such as country risk and community facilities. The decision on plant location thus relies mostly on the subjective intuition and assessment of the manufacturer. This paper explains the development of a decision-making model for a clothing plant location, using the feed-forward neural network with an error back-propagation (EBP) learning algorithm and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Significant variables in the selection of a clothing plant location will be identified and input into the proposed decision-making model. A suitability index was computed for each site. The sites with higher suitability indices were more appropriate for the establishment of a clothing plant.

The accuracy with which stones are graded prior to their being processed through the various manufacturing stages of cutting and finishing is a key determinant of yield and so profit. This presently manual activity requires a skilled craftsman to assess the grade and spot opportunities for upgrading through the judicious cutting away of imperfections in the raw material. There is however a balance to be struck between raising quality and lowering wastage. This paper describes iGem , an artificial intelligence tool that integrates rule-based knowledge representation, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to produce a system for automating, and introducing consistency into, the grading of diamonds and gemstones. In this paper we show how iGem derives its knowledge from repeated examples of previously correctly graded stones and can improve its performance by learning from experience. The industrial benefit of iGem extends beyond simply improving grading but also to the introduction of consistency and so greater control into the overall manufacturing process. We believe the approach described has application in other situations where overall yield and manufacturing efficiency depends on trade-off decisions between removal of imperfections and loss of material as well as consistency in quality assessment.

Another issue in intrusion detection is that most of the intrusion detection systems are performed by off-line and it is not proper method for realtime intrusion detection system. In this paper, we develop the realtime intrusion detection system which combining on-line feature extraction method with Least Squares Support Vector Machine classifier. Applying proposed system to KDD CUP 99 data, experimental results show that it have remarkable feature feature extraction and classification performance compared to existing off-line intrusion detection system.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11589990_18,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the hybrid-gaming simulation, autonomous AI agents and human players competed against each other in a high-tech industrial model. Firm agents (both AI agents and human players) determined the levels of R&D investment and production investment. The efficiencies of AI agents were compared with those of their human counterparts and the varying strategies of both AI agents and human players were assessed and verified. It was found that the learning speed of human players was much faster than AI agents and that the AI agents were validated and competed successfully against the human players. Long-term maximization agents playing against human players performed well, but short-term maximization agents failed. This confirmed the importance of agent tuning when playing a hybrid-gaming simulation. In future work, we will formulate our current model in an extensive game form and analyze the model more thoroughly. By carrying out more hybrid-gaming simulations with a dynamic model, it will be possible to analyze the model and create a robust theoretical formula.

These industries are, nowadays, responsible for substantial emissions of SO2, NOx, particles, VOCs and part of the ozone polluting the atmosphere. The major industries are spatially concentrated in a restricted area, very close to populated areas and natural resources. Their emissions are very similar, making the identification of individual pollutant sources and of their contributions to air pollution difficult. In this study, the regional spatial dispersion of sulphur dioxide (SO2) is characterized, through the combined use of diffusive tubes (Radiello Passive Samplers) and classical monitoring stations’ air quality data. The objective of this study is to create a regional predictive model of the contribution of different emission sources to the pollutant concentrations captured at each monitoring station. A two-step methodology was used in this study. First, the time series of each data pair - industrial emission and monitoring station records - was screened, in order to obtain contiguous time periods with a high contribution of that specific industrial emission to the equivalent monitoring-station measurements. For this purpose, an iterative optimisation process was developed, using a variogram between industrial emissions and monitoring-station time series as the objective function. Afterwards, probability neural networks (PNN) were applied to achieve an automatic classification of the time series into two classes: a class of (emission/monitoring station) pairs of highly correlated points and a class of pairs of points without correlation In a second step, the relationship between time series of emissions and air quality (AQ) monitoring station records - time model - is validated for the entire area for a given period of time, using for that purpose the diffusive samplers measurements. A spatial stochastic simulation is applied to generate a set of equi-probable images of the pollutant, which relationship with the different emissions is calculated using the PNN predictive model.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4020-3610-1_83,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper focuses on learning to act in a near-optimal manner through reinforcement learning for problems that either have no model or the model is too complex. One approach to solving this class of problems is via approximate dynamic programming. The application of these methods are established primarily for the case of discrete state and action spaces. In this paper we develop efficient methods of learning which act in complex systems with continuous state and action spaces. Monte-Carlo approaches are employed to estimate function values in an iterative, incremental procedure. Derivative-free line search methods are used to obtain a near-optimal action in the continuous action space for a discrete subset of the state space. This near-optimal control policy is then extended to the entire continuous state space via a fuzzy additive model. To compensate for approximation errors, a modified procedure for perturbing the generated control policy is developed.

The magnitude of the deterioration depends on the rock's properties. Aggregate, including crushed carbonate rock, is required to have minimum geotechnical qualities before it can be used in asphalt and concrete. In order to reduce chances of premature and expensive repairs, extensive freeze-thaw tests are conducted on potential construction rocks. These tests typically involve 300 freeze-thaw cycles and can take four to five months to complete. Less time consuming tests that (1) predict durability as well as the extended freeze-thaw test or that (2) reduce the number of rocks subject to the extended test, could save considerable amounts of money. Here we use a probabilistic neural network to try and predict durability as determined by the freeze-thaw test using four rock properties measured on 843 limestone samples from the Kansas Department of Transportation. Modified freeze-thaw tests and less time consuming specific gravity (dry), specific gravity (saturated), and modified absorption tests were conducted on each sample. Durability factors of 95 or more as determined from the extensive freeze-thaw tests are viewed as acceptable—rocks with values below 95 are rejected. If only the modified freeze-thaw test is used to predict which rocks are acceptable, about 45% are misclassified. When 421 randomly selected samples and all four standardized and scaled variables were used to train aprobabilistic neural network, the rate of misclassification of 422 independent validation samples dropped to 28%. The network was trained so that each class (group) and each variable had its own coefficient (sigma). In an attempt to reduce errors further, an additional class was added to the training data to predict durability values greater than 84 and less than 98, resulting in only 11% of the samples misclassified. About 43% of the test data was classed by the neural net into the middle group—these rocks should be subject to full freeze-thaw tests. Thus, use of the probabilistic neural network would meanthat the extended test would only need be applied to 43% of the samples, and 11% of the rocks classed as acceptable would fail early.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1024266829365,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A back propagation neural network monitors a manufacturing process and identifies faulty quality categories of the products being produced. For diagnosis of the process, rough set is used to extract the causal relationship between manufacturing parameters and product quality measures. Therefore, an integration of neural networks and a rough set approach not only provides information about what is expected to happen, but also reveals why this has occurred and how to recover from the abnormal condition with specific guidelines on process parameter settings. The methodology is successfully implemented in an Ethernet network environment with sensors and PLC connected to the manufacturing processes and control computers. In an application to a manufacturing system that makes conveyor belts, the back propagation neural network accurately classified quality faults, such as wrinkles and uneven thickness. The rough set also determined the causal relationships between manufacturing parameters, e.g., process temperature, and output quality measures. In addition, rough set provided operating guidelines on specific settings of process parameters to the operators to correct the detected quality problems. The successful implementation of the developed methodology also lays a solid foundation for the development of Internet-based e-manufacturing.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1022911715996,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1023/A:1024432723561,Process Monitoring Strategies for Surface Mount Manufacturing Processes,International Journal of Flexible Manufacturing Systems,10.1023/A:1024432723561,Springer,2003-04-01,"Establishing reliable surface mount assemblies requires robust design and assembly practices, including stringent process control schemes for achieving high yield processes and high quality solder interconnects. Conventional Shewhart-based process control charts prevalent in today's complex surface mount manufacturing processes are found to be inadequate as a result of autocorrelation, high false alarm probability, and inability to detect process deterioration. Hence, new strategies are needed to circumvent the shortcomings of traditional process control techniques. In this article, the adequacy of Shewhart models in a surface mount manufacturing environment is examined and some alternative solutions and strategies for process monitoring are discussed. For modeling solder paste deposition process data, a time series analysis based on neural network models is highly desirable for both controllability and predictability. In particular, neural networks can be trained to model the autocorrelated time series, learn historical process behavior, and forecast future process performance with low prediction errors. This forecasting ability is especially useful for early detection of solder paste deterioration, so that timely remedial actions can be taken, minimizing the impact on subsequent yields of downstream processes. As for the automated component placement process where very low fraction nonconforming frequently occurs, control-charting schemes based on cumulative counts of conforming items produced prior to detection of nonconforming items is more sensitive in flagging process deterioration. For the reflow soldering and wave-soldering processes, the use of demerit control charts is appealing as it provides not only better control when various defects with a different degree of severity are encountered, but also leads to an improved ARL performance. Illustrative examples of actual process data are presented to demonstrate these approaches.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1024432723561,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A growing outward trend has been the ‘regionalisation’ of the local construction industry with the result that there has been an increase in construction firms competing for projects abroad. Contracts won abroad will bring in export earnings to the economy that can offset, in part, the leakage due to imports of foreign services and building materials. With the maturing of Singapore’s economy, we shall see increasing refurbishment and restoration work in the future.

All data for analysis were collected from industrial scale cultures in a pharmaceutical company. First, we constructed an estimation model for glucose feed rate to keep glucose concentration at target value. In actual fed-batch culture, glucose concentration, was kept at relatively high and measured once a day, and the glucose feed rate until the next measurement time was determined by an expert worker based on the actual consumption rate. Fuzzy neural network (FNN) was applied to construct the estimation model. From the simulation results using this model, the average error for glucose concentration was 0.88 g/L. The FNN model was also applied for a special culture to keep glucose concentration at low level. Selecting the optimal input variables, it was possible to simulate the culture with a low glucose concentration from the data sets of relatively high glucose concentration. Next, a simulation model to estimate time course of glucose concentration during one day was constructed using the on-line measurable process variables, since glucose concentration was only measured off-line once a day. Here, the recursive fuzzy neural network (RFNN) was applied for the simulation model. As the result of the simulation, average error of RFNN model was 0.91 g/L and this model was found to be useful to supervise the fed-batch culture.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF02932836,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This is referred to as revenue management and it forms a crucial aspect of airline logistics. Ticket pricing, seat or discount allocation, and overbooking are some of the important aspects of a revenue management problem. Though ticket pricing is usually heavily influenced by factors beyond the control of an airline company, significant amount of control can be exercised over the seat allocation and the overbooking aspects. A realistic model for a single leg of a flight should consider multiple fare classes , overbooking of the flight, concurrent demand arrivals of passengers from the different fare classes, and class-dependent , random cancellations . Accommodating all these factors in one optimization model is a challenging task because that makes it a very large-scale stochastic optimization problem. Almost all papers in the existing literature either accommodate only a subset of these factors or use a discrete approximation in order to make the model tractable. We consider all these factors and cast the single leg problem as a semi-Markov Decision Problem (SMDP) under the average reward optimizing criterion over an infinite time horizon. We solve it using a stochastic optimization technique called Reinforcement Learning. Not only is Reinforcement Learning able to scale up to a huge state-space but because it is simulation-based it can also handle complex modeling assumptions such as the ones mentioned above. The state-space of the numerical test problem scenarios considered here is non-denumerable; its countable part being of the order of 10^9. Our solution procedure involves a multi-step extension of the SMART algorithm which is based on the one-step Bellman equation. Numerical results presented here show that our approach is able to outperform a heuristic, namely the nested version of the EMSR heuristic, which is widely used in the airline industry .

Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies.

As technology in general races ahead challenges arise for both commercial designers and educators on how best to keep track and utilise the advances. The challenge is particularly acute within tertiary education where the introduction of new cutting edge technology is often encouraged. Although this is generally achieved through the feedback of research activity, integrating new concepts at an appropriate level is a major task. Of particular concern is how focussed areas of applied technology can be made part of the multidisciplinary scope of design education. The paper describes the model used to introduce areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to undergraduate industrial design students. The successful interaction of research and education within a UK higher education establishment are discussed and project examples given. It is shown that, through selective tuition of research topics and appropriate technical support, innovative design solutions can result.

In this paper, the Kohonen self-organizing neural networks and Hopfield networks are adopted to solve such problems in setup planning efficiently. Kohonen self-organizing neural networks are utilized, according to the nature of the different steps in setup planning, to generate setups in terms of the constraints of fixtures/jigs, approach directions, feature precedence relationships, and tolerance relationships. The operation sequence problem and the setup sequence problem are mapped onto the traveling salesman problem, and are solved by Hopfield neural networks.

Article,doi:10.1023/A:1008919013557,Intelligent scheduling and control of rail-guided vehicles and load/unload operations in a flexible manufacturing system,Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing,10.1023/A:1008919013557,Springer,1999-11-01,"This paper presents a framework of intelligent manufacturing scheduling and control with specific applications to operations of rail-guided vehicle systems (RGVS). A RGVS control architecture is discussed with a focus on a simulated experiment in operations of the load/unload area of a real industrial flexible manufacturing system (FMS). In the operation stage of a material handling system (MHS), all shop floor data are subject to change as time goes. These data can be collected using a data acquisition device and stored in a dynamic database. The RGVS simulator used in this experimental study is designed to incorporate some possible situations representing existing material handling scenarios in order to evaluate alternative control policies. At the development stage of the controller, all possible combinations of most commonly encountered scenarios such as RGV failures, production schedule changes, machine breakdowns, and rush orders are to be simulated and corresponding results collected. The data are then structured into training data pairs to properly train an artificial neural network. The neural network, trained by using input/output data sets obtained from a number of simulation runs, will then provide control strategy recommendations. At the application stage, whenever an abnormal scenario occurs, a pre-processor will be activated to pre-screen and prepare an input vector for the trained neural network. If such an abnormal scenario falls outside the existing domain of data sets employed to train the neural network, as judged by the MHS supervisory controller, an off-line training module will be activated to eventually update the neural network. The recommended control strategies will be transmitted to the MHS control for real-time execution. If there is no further abnormal event detected, the dynamic data base (DDB) module simply continues to monitor the MHS activities. The proposed MHS control system combines the features of example based neural network technology and simulation modeling for true intelligent, on-line, pseudo real-time control. Not only will the system assure that feasible material handling control actions be taken, but also it will implement better control decisions through continuous learning from experiences captured as the operation time of the MHS accumulates.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008919013557,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In an artificial intelligence (AI) technique such as the NBES, the semantic structure of If-Then rules is preserved, while incorporating the learning capability of ANNs into the inference mechanism. Unlike implementing a popular back propagation network (BPN) as an ES, the proposed BAMFLO (Bidirectional Associative Memories for Facility LayOut) system is an intelligent layout consultant system consisting of pipeline BAM neural networks with simple, fast incremental learning and multiple bidirectional generalization characteristics. This incrementability makes BAMFLO effective at acquiring, adding or adapting learned layout knowledge; thus it is possible to memorize newly extended If-Then layout rules without retraining old ones. The multi-bidirectionality gives BAMFLO the ability to quickly and reliably generalize a layout solution, and to further infer unknown facts from known facts through a complex knowledge base (memorization) without losing information. The solution process of BAMFLO contains three essential steps: training example generation, incremental learning and solution generalization. The examples (layout knowledge) can be generated from practical experience and/or classical layout software solutions for incrementally training BAMFLO; the process then derives multiply bidirectionally generalized construction layout solutions. The experimental results show that the BAMFLO scheme outperforms five classical layout methods used to generate training examples.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008980812648,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many records have fields that are not filled in, especially, when data entry is manual. In addition, a significant fraction of the entries can be erroneous and there may be no alternative but to discard these records. But every cell in a database is not an independent datum. Statistical relationships will constrain and, often determine, missing values. Data imputation, the filling in of missing values for partially missing data, can thus be an invaluable first step in many IDA projects. New imputation methods that can handle the large-scale problems and large-scale sparsity of industrial databases are needed. To illustrate the incomplete database problem, we analyze one database with instrumentation maintenance and test records for an industrial process. Despite regulatory requirements for process data collection, this database is less than 50% complete. Next, we discuss possible solutions to the missing data problem. Several approaches to imputation are noted and classified into two categories: data-driven and model-based. We then describe two machine-learning-based approaches that we have worked with. These build upon well-known algorithms: AutoClass and C4.5. Several experiments are designed, all using the maintenance database as a common test-bed but with various data splits and algorithmic variations. Results are generally positive with up to 80% accuracies of imputation.

These information are then fed into a four layer feed-forward neural network that provides a designer with the desired features that meet the current manufacturing constraints for design of a new product or part.

The face complexity code is a measure of the face complexity of a feature based on the convexity or concavity of the surrounding geometry. The codes for various features are fed to the network for analysis. A backpropagation network is implemented for recognition of features and tested on published results to measure its performance. Any two or more features having significant differences in face complexity codes were used as exemplars for training the network. A new feature presented to the network is associated with one of the existing clusters, if they are similar, or the network creates a new cluster, if otherwise. Experimental results show that the network was consistent in recognizing features, hence is appropriate for application to the problem of feature recognition in automated manufacturing environment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008904109029,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The ability to describe an arbitrary dependence follows from the universal approximation theorem, according to which an arbitrary continuous function of a bounded set can be, within a given accuracy, approximated by an appropriate NN. The measured values of y are often only known with interval uncertainty. To describe such situations, we can allow interval parameters in a NN and thus, consider an interval NN.

In order to improve on the classification accuracy of this single network, a decision tree of smaller and more specialised modular neural networks is introduced to achieve a classification by successive refinement. This results in a substantial improvement in classification accuracy.

One of the main goals in the automated factory environment is, therefore, the exploitation of resources to the full, in such a way as to optimize productivity. As widely documented in literature, this is a hard task on account of its computational complexity. For this reason a number of heuristic techniques are currently available, the best known of which are based on Event Graphs, which are a particular class of Petri Nets. The paper proposes a performance optimization technique which, although it is based on Event Graphs, applies algorithms which are different from traditional heuristic ones. More specifically, a novel neural model is used to solve the optimization problem. The neural model was obtained by making significant changes to a network that is well known in literature: the Hopfield network. The solution proposed is an original one and features several advantages against the most known heuristic approaches to the problem, the most important of which is the possibility of optimal or close to optimal solutions in a polynomial time, proportional to the size of the FMS. In addition, the possibility of simple, economical hardware implementation of the neural model favours its integration in the automated factory environment, allowing real-time supervision and optimization of productivity. The aim of the paper is to present the new neural model and its use in optimizing the performance of FMSs. A comparison of the neural approach with classical heuristic solutions and its real-time calculation capability, will also be treated in the paper.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008244007194,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore the reduction in process variability obtained through the use of SPC techniques has not been realized in process industries. Techniques are needed to serve the same function as SPC control charts, that is to identify process shifts, in correlated parameters. Radial basis function neural networks were developed to identify shifts in process parameter values from papermaking and viscosity data sets available in the literature. Time series residual control charts were also developed for the data sets. Networks were successful at separating data that were shifted 1.5 and 2 standard deviations from nonshifted data for both the papermaking and viscosity parameter values. The network developed on the basis of the papermaking data set was also able to separate shifts of 1 standard deviation from nonshifted data.

The methodology uses several techniques: Dynamic Neural Network Control (DNNC) network structure, neuro-statistical (neural network, conventional statistical, and non-parametric statistical such as ACE; Alternative Conditional Expectation) techniques, Geometric Model-Based Control Strategy, and stability analysis techniques such as Liapunov theory. In this study, the DNNC model is used because it is much easier to update and adapt the network on-line. The neuro-statistical technique is used because the model can deal with uncertainty in data. The neuro-statistical model uses neural network techniques, since the functional structure of the data is unknown and uses statistical technique because the data and our requirements are imperfect. In addition, this technique in conjunction with Levenberge-Marquardt algorithm can be used as a more robust technique for network training and optimization purposes. The ACE technique is used for scaling the network’s input-output data and can be used to find the input structure of the network. The result from Liapunov theory is used to find optimal neural network structure. In addition, a special neural network structure is used to insure the stability of the network for long-term prediction.

One remaining challenge is to develop effective methods of AGV decisions for improved system productivity. This paper describes a prototype neural network approach for the AGV problem in an FMS environment. A group of neural network models are proposed to perform dispatching and routeing tasks for the AGV under conditions of single or multiple vehicles, and with or without time windows.

This has led to the development of new scheduling models, such as Petri nets, time-augmented Petri nets, fuzzy scheduling models and neural net scheduling models. A fundamental objective of any scheduling system is event synchronisation and optimisation of command, communication and control C^3 between each active node of the overall CIM structure. CIM scheduling can be regarded as a nonlinear dynamic control process, whereby, the feed forward or feedback elements are the scheduling priorities that enable the manufacturing organisation to remain within a “steady-state” profit margin. However, in each different hierarchy level of the organisation, randomness phenomena in the C^3 environment can be observed, i.e. events in a particular department or organisational level cause a perturbation elsewhere in the manufacturing organisation. Furthermore, these changes are constrained by the framework of rules pre-set by the organisational structure and business corporate strategy. To a first approximation, these cause-and-effect phenomena can be viewed as deterministic changes which may result in “deterministic chaos”. In this paper, a self-organising compensating information system (SOCIS) is presented. This system is designed utilising knowledge control modelling (KCM) topology with its architecture based on the principles of client-server and a second-order proportional-integral-differential knowledge-based management system (PID-KBMS).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01845697,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This work supports the development of an Intelligent Open Die Forging System which will integrate state-of-the-art modelling techniques, automatic die selection and sequencing, full system dynamic simulation, automatic machine programming and coordination, and sensor-based process control to enable the production of more general and complex workpiece geometries than are achievable using current forging methods. Effective automation of this open die forging system requires the coordination and control of the major system components: press, robot, and furnace. In particular, forces exerted on the robot through its manipulation of the workpiece during forging must be minimized to avoid damage to the manipulator mechanism. In this paper, the application of neural networks for compliance control of the forging robot to minimize these forces is investigated. Effectiveness of the neural network-based compliance control module is evaluated through a full dynamic system simulation, which will later form a central part of the complete Intelligent Forging System.

The ultimate goal of the research discussed in this paper is to develop a comparehensive monitor and control (M&C) system that can substitute for the expert machinist and perform certain critical in-process tasks to assure quality production. The M&C system must reliably recognize and respond to qualitatively different behaviours of the machine tool, learn new behaviors, respond faster than its human counterpart to quality threatening circumstances, and interface with an existing controller. The research considers a series of face-milling anomalies that were subsequently simulated and used as a first step towards establishing the feasibility of employing machine learning as an integral component of the intelligent controller. We address the question of feasibility in two steps. First, it is important to know if the process models (dull tool, broken tool, etc.) can be learned (model learning). And second, if the models are learned, can an algorithm reliably select an appropriate model (distinguish between dull and broken tools) based on input from the model learner and from the sensors (model selection). The results of the simulation-based tests demonstrate that the milling-process anomalies can be learned, and the appropriate model can be reliably selected. Such a model can be subsequently utilized to make compensating in-process machine-tool adjustments.

One might argue that AI has only very recently started building systems that are able to display human-level intelligence in certain domains. The necessity for applying AI to managerial and engineering control problems originates from the growing complexity of current systems, as well as from the traditional expense, time constraints, and limited availability of human expertise.

The fields of application are One-of-a-Kind products and industrial prototypes. The first example is taken from the problem area of typically high complex capital goods being virtually modelled and simulated prior to the real setting-up. The strategy of complimentarily developing both, the prototype’s mechanics and its functionality and the issues of concurrent and distributed team-work are characterised. Enabling technologies for the iterative setting-up of the real prototype are described with reference to practical experience. The second example is the virtual and the touchable prototyping of sheet metal parts, incorporating the FEM simulation of the process as well as the closed prototyping chain for a fast verification of the results. An enabling technology is the triangulation of parametric CAD surface models, a technique to represent random solid bodies as a polyedrical mesh, from which “real” and “virtual” prototypers will equally profit. The possibility to include surface data acquired by 3D measurement systems is also discussed. As a conclusion, the modelling of process chains is seen as an adequate approach to achieve better clarity in production as well as in the product development, describing actions and streams in between them. Their addition leads to a reference model for rapid product development and One-of-a-Kind Production, providing an abstract view of the various process chains in a neutral and logical manner.

In order to produce several types of products simultaneously in an effective way, many manufacturers have installed flexible manufacturing systems that consist of numerically control-led machines. These machines are flexible in the sense that negligible set-up time is incurred when a machine switches from processing one product to another. One of the most important reasons for a manufacturer to introduce a flexible manufacturing system is the possibility to combine optimal logistic performance of the manufacturing system [e.g. work-in-process (WIP) levels or product leadtimes] with a high flexibility of production, which is today’s prerequisite to survive in a competitive consumer market. To ensure this it becomes more and more important to properly design a flexible manufacturing system such that the required logistic performance is achieved within the given investment constraints. Logistic performance measures that have received much attention lately are, for example, the average leadtimes of the products, the average WIP levels and the average throughputs. What becomes important then is to investigate the quantitative aspects of these logistic performance measures related with a given design. Expert systems using operations research/artificial intelligence (OR/AI) rules can play a very important role in the optimal tuning of these quantitative aspects.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-94-011-0703-7_2,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A probe records a one-dimensional image, which is processed using multilayer perceptrons, yielding meat and fat thicknesses. The thicknesses from all the probes are subsequently fed to a recurrent neural network, which locates and predicts faulty or missing thicknesses.

As a result of several brain storming sessions with some colleagues in electrical engineering, the author now realizes that hardware devices are on the market today, which use “software configurable hardware” technologies that the author believes can be used to build Darwin Machines within a year or two. This paper suggests there are at least two approaches to be taken. The first approach uses “software configurable hardware” chips, e.g. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), HDPLDs (High Density Programmable Logic Devices), or possibly a new generation of chips based on the ideas that FPGAs etc embody. The second approach uses a special hardware device called a “hardware accelerator” which accelerates the simulation in software of digital hardware devices containing up to several hundred thousand gates. Darwin Machines will be essential if artificial nervous systems are to be evolved for biots (i.e. biological robots) which consist of thousands of evolved neural network modules (called GenNets). The evolution time of 1000-GenNet biots will need to be reduced by many orders of magnitude if they are to be built at all. It is for this reason that Darwin Machines may prove to be a breakthrough in biotic design. When molecular scale technologies come on line in the late 1990s, the Darwin Machine approach will probably be the only way to build self assembling, self testing molecular scale devices.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-7533-0_64,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We developped this solution in the context of leather quality control. This leather is used in car sits manufacturing (c.f. figure 1). The aim of this control is to make sure of the compatibility of every visual aspect in the whole car. This job is currently processed by human experts that cannot inspect every sits with the same attention. The automation of such a process is very complicated because it is necessary to build a model of human vision in order to take into account how a texture is interpreted as an aspect. As a matter of fact, human perception is processed with subjectivity that makes very hard to propose an efficient explicit mathematical model. We explain why neural networks can be useful in such an application, and we expose our solution. We describe technical gears of this solution (fractals preprocessing, neural architecture,...) and we explain how we built the global solution with the help of the A.G.E.N.D.A. methodology.

Such applications are based, mostly, on a subarea of ML called learning from examples. The basic research in this subarea is due to Hunt et al (1966), Michalski (1972) and Quinlan (1979). Further developments of these works can be found in Michalski et al (1978), Quinlan (1986) and Niblett and Clark (1987). A number of commercial and industrial applications of ML are discussed in Mowforth(1986) and Clark et al (1991). Regarding the volume of research done in the last years in ML, one can easily conclude that the number of successful applications of ML in commerce and industry is too limited. Some reasons for this limitation are discussed in the joint paper of Clark et al (1991) which can be summarized as follows: The ML-algorithms mainly handle synthetic data while the solution of real world problems usually requires handling of analytic large-scale datasets. The incorporation of domain-specific properties in the acquired knowledge has not been sufficiently considered yet in the ML research. To handle the applications of real-world, several methods should be combined together. Scientific and engineering domains tend to require more structured representation.

In growing tissue, the xylem had the highest water potential and cells located near the epidermal surface had the lowest water potential. When plants were subjected to environmental stresses, the growth-induced water potential field collapsed, resulting in growth inhibition. Practically speaking, the magnitude of a growth-induced water potential field can be estimated from differences between water potentials of the elongating region and the water source. Because the growth-induced water potential field recovers prior to growth recovery, if the growth-induced water potential field can be determined appropriately, growth behavior of crops can be predicted under controlled environments.

The purpose of this project is to explore methods of combining multiple AI technologies into a hybrid intelligent diagnostic and advisory system. ANNs and ESs have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be exploited in such a way that they are complementary to each other: strengths in one system make up for weaknesses in the other, and vice versa . There is, presently, considerable interest in ways to exploit the strengths of these methodologies to produce an intelligent system which is more robust and flexible than one using either technology alone. Any process which involves both data-driven (bottom-up) and concept-driven (top-down) processing is especially well suited to displaying the capabilities of such a hybrid system. The system can take an incoming pattern of signals, as from various points in an automated manufacturing process, and make intelligent process control decisions on the basis of the pattern as preprocessed by the ANNs, with rule-based heuristic help or corroboration from the ES. Patterns of data from the environment which can be classified by either the ES or a human consultant can result in a high-level ANN being created and trained to recognize that pattern on future occurrences. In subsequent cases in which the ANN and the ES fail to agree on a decision concerning the environmental situation, the system can resolve those differences and retrain the networks and/or modify the models of the environment stored in the ES. Work on a hybrid system for perception in machine vision has been funded initially by an Oak Ridge National Laboratory seed grant, and most of the system components are operating presently in a parallel distributed computer environment.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01471174,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The neurons act as non-linear processing elements within the network. An attractive property of artificial neural networks is that given the appropriate network topology, they are capable of learning and characterising non-linear functional relationships. Furthermore, the structure of the resulting neural network based process model may be considered generic, in the sense that little prior process knowledge is required in its determination. The methodology therefore provides a cost efficient and reliable process modelling technique. One area where such a technique could be useful is biotechnological systems. Here, for example, the use of a process model within an estimation scheme has long been considered an effective means of overcoming inherent on-line measurement problems. However, the development of an accurate process model is extremely time consuming and often results in a model of limited applicability. Artificial neural networks could therefore prove to be a useful model building tool when striving to improve bioprocess operability.

The study forecasts the sales and penetration of neural network technology resulting from anticipated gains in the power and capability of connectionist technology during this time period. Standard projections of employment and productivity in the American economy are examined, and then are contrasted with projections made by the author based on the forecasted penetration of neural network technology. The study concludes that the power of neural networks will increase exponentially during the next twenty years, and predicts that by 2010 connectionist technology will have become the predominant computer architecture. Given this projected enormous increase in power and capability, and the anticipated high degree of market penetration, the study forecasts profound impacts of neural network technology on employment, labor, training, and GNP. Because neural network technology will enable machines to perform a wide range of tasks heretofore reserved for humans, the study predicts that the widespread adoption of neural network technology will produce a far greater degree of economic dislocation than resulted from the introduction of conventional computers in previous decades.

In flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), the computer program carrying out these problem-solving activities must additionally be able to handle the shorter lead time, the flexibility of job routing, the multiprocessing environment, the dynamic changing states, and the versatility of machines. This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) method to perform manufacturing problem solving. Since the method is driven by manufacturing scenarios represented by symbolic patterns, it is referred to as pattern-directed. The method is based on three AI techniques. The first is the pattern-directed inference technique to capture the dynamic nature of FMSs. The second is the nonlinear planning technique to construct schedules and assign resources. The third is the inductive learning method to generate the pattern-directed heuristics. This article focuses on solving the FMS scheduling problem. In addition, this article reports the computation results to evaluate the utility of various heuristic functions, to identify important design parameters, and to analyze the resulting computational performance in using the pattern-directed approach for manufacturing problem-solving tasks such as scheduling.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF00222707,springer,industry,'industry' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Such a system consists of three components: (i) a knowledge base of states, which describes both the current task domain situation and the goal to be achieved; (ii) a set of operators that are used to manipulate the knowledge base; and (iii) a control strategy to decide which operators to apply next and to resolve conflicts. Some of the interesting features of the scheduling system include: (i) the ability to detect resource conflicts; (ii) the ability to determine alternate routes for a given part in the event of a resource conflict; and (iii) the ability to amend plans if an alternate route is found. These features allow the system to take advantage of the flexible routing for parts that an FMS allows. The system has been implemented using the XLISP programming language.

The organisational structures and management methods currently adopted in such enterprises are firmly based upon historical developments which started with individual craftsmen. These structures and methods are primarily concerned with the co-ordination of human activities, rather than with the management of the knowledge process underlying the creation of products. This paper argues that it is the failure to understand this knowledge process and its effective integration at a Knowledge Level which presents the real barrier to increased flexibility, not, as is presently perceived, a lack of suitable Information Level integration. Potential techniques and methodologies for achieving Knowledge Level integration are beginning to emerge from Artificial Intelligence research. Realisation of full Knowledge Level integration will not only require further research into the AI techniques and methodologies involved, but also an understanding of the wider human aspects of their application.
