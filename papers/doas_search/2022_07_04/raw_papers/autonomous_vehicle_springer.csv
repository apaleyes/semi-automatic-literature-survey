In order to help spread the potential benefits of autonomy sooner, as well as to cater to people who will continue to prefer to drive themselves while improving safety, there is a need for intelligent interaction and collaboration between increasingly automated vehicles and humans. At Toyota Research Institute, we call this Human-Centric Intelligent Driving (HCID). HCID has many technical challenges, some of which are shared with fully autonomous driving. Due to the collaborative nature between humans and machines in HCID, some of these challenges are particularly important and potentially different from fully autonomous driving. This chapter focuses on Toyota Research Institute’s (TRI) approach to addressing some of these core challenges.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-11112-9_8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In 2013, deep neural networks were vulnerable to perturbed samples during the testing/deployment stage. Deep learning becomes a significant issue when we apply such algorithms in designing safety–critical applications. Deep neural networks are fooled by adding some noise intentionally in the image such that the changes are sometimes not noticeable to the human eye and are known as an adversarial mechanism. The noise adds in such a direction that the difference between the original and perturbed images should be minimal. This work demonstrates the designing of adversarial images and analyzing them on the disease prediction using a chest X-ray prototype system. This work illustrates the design of adversarial samples using three different methods: an image augmentation scheme, filtering, and patches and analysis of how adversarial samples affect the result in real-world clinical settings. The change in the clinical setting not only affects the healthcare economy but also raises technical vulnerability. This work attempts to design and improve a more robust medical learning system. The analysis shows if patches applied in specific regions give expected results to the adversary. In this work, after the successful attack model shows 71% of confidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0151-5_29,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The growing potential of multimodal data streams and deep learning algorithms has contributed to the increasing universality of deep multimodal learning. This involves the development of models capable of processing and analyzing the multimodal information uniformly. Unstructured real-world data can inherently take many forms, also known as modalities, often including visual and textual content. Extracting relevant patterns from this kind of data is still a motivating goal for researchers in deep learning. In this paper, we seek to improve the understanding of key concepts and algorithms of deep multimodal learning for the computer vision community by exploring how to generate deep models that consider the integration and combination of heterogeneous visual cues across sensory modalities. In particular, we summarize six perspectives from the current literature on deep multimodal learning, namely: multimodal data representation, multimodal fusion (i.e., both traditional and deep learning-based schemes), multitask learning, multimodal alignment, multimodal transfer learning, and zero-shot learning. We also survey current multimodal applications and present a collection of benchmark datasets for solving problems in various vision domains.

However, predicting real time demand at the micro-geographical level is a challenging task due to its underlying complexity, and prior work has focused largely on predicting one-step-ahead demand at a macro-geographical level, often using classical times series models that do not consider exogenous factors or quantify the prediction uncertainty in a probabilistic setting. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based framework with a novel architecture to predict multi-step-ahead real time travel demand, along with uncertainty estimation. The model is multi-stage and captures both spatial and temporal aspects. We employ the encoder-decoder framework with variations of convolution and LSTM units, and incorporate an attention mechanism into the model to quantify the interdependence between the input and output elements.

Emerging industrial revolutions started to shapeshift many well-known applications to address topics that concern the human race because of the change done to the ecological system regarding carbon emission and environmental pollution. IoE will be the vertical application for this greener innovation projected to have many IoT devices in many fields. The repercussion of mischievous attacks on this new technology would be a calamity in both physical meanings and trustworthiness; the rapid escalation in the number of eco-friendly services developments will have a massive blowback, especially while we are on the 5G doorstep. Focusing on security will help promote the expansion of IoE and greener solutions and the relationship for exploiting the benefits of the smart grid, cloud computing, internet of vehicles. Though this is a new area of research, it has attracted significant attention already. Still, many studies have been done separately to examine the challenges from various angles without reflecting the chronological growth of this technology and security aspects to achieve better strategies. This paper represents a survey related to the surrounding concerns and comparisons for IoE before and after involvement in such services as no survey covers the broad aspect of this topic, discussing its future research opportunities, the raised concern regarding it.

The cameras of smartphones have small apertures and small sensor cells, which lead to the noisy images in low light environment. Denoising based on a burst of multiple frames generally outperforms single frame denoising but with the larger compututional cost. In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective burst denoising system. We adopt a three-stage design: noise prior integration, multi-frame alignment and multi-frame denoising. First, we integrate noise prior by pre-processing raw signals into a variance-stabilization space, which allows using a small-scale network to achieve competitive performance. Second, we observe that it is essential to adopt an explicit alignment for burst denoising, but it is not necessary to integrate an learning-based method to perform multi-frame alignment. Instead, we resort to a conventional and efficient alignment method and combine it with our multi-frame denoising network. At last, we propose a denoising strategy that processes multiple frames sequentially. Sequential denoising avoids filtering a large number of frames by decomposing multiple frames denoising into several efficient sub-network denoising. As for each sub-network, we propose an efficient multi-frequency denoising network to remove noise of different frequencies. Our three-stage design is efficient and shows strong performance on burst denoising. Experiments on synthetic and real raw datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with less computational cost. Furthermore, the low complexity and high-quality performance make deployment on smartphones possible.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-022-01627-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Modelling social interactions is of great significance for pedestrian trajectory prediction. However, most of the existing works only focus on the pair-wise interactions of humans but ignore the group-wise interactions. This paper proposes a group constrained hierarchical graph attention network, GCHGAT, to capture the intragroup, outgroup, and intergroup interaction separately. We first get a rough prediction via a vanilla generative adversarial network. Then, a state-refinement module is used to refine the rough prediction based on interaction information. We compare the performance of our method with related methods on the ETH and UCY datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms all benchmarks with the lowest average prediction error and successfully predicts complex social behaviours.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-021-02997-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These uncertainties sometimes call for conceptual engineering, but it is not often recognized when this is the case. We take this to be a missed opportunity, as a recognition that different researchers are working on the same kind of project can help solve methodological questions that one is likely to encounter. In this paper, we present three case studies where philosophers of technology implicitly engage in conceptual engineering (without naming it as such). We subsequently reflect on the case studies to find out how these illustrate conceptual engineering as an appropriate method to deal with pressing concerns in the philosophy of technology. We have two main goals. We first want to contribute to the literature on conceptual engineering by presenting concrete examples of conceptual engineering in the philosophy of technology. This is especially relevant, because the technologies that are designed based on the conceptual work done by philosophers of technology potentially have crucial moral and social implications. Secondly, we want to make explicit what choices are made when doing this conceptual work. Making explicit that some of the implicit assumptions are, in fact, debated in the literature allows for reflection on these questions.

Unfortunately, the problems of misinformation and disinformation are exacerbated due to the wide availability of online platforms and social networks. Naturally, these emerging disinformation networks could lead users to engage with critical infrastructure systems in harmful ways, leading to broader adverse impacts. One such example involves the spread of false pricing information, which causes drastic and sudden changes in user commodity consumption behavior, leading to shortages. Given this, it is critical to address the following related questions: (i) How can we monitor the evolution of disinformation dissemination and its projected impacts on commodity consumption? (ii) What effects do the mitigation efforts of human intermediaries have on the performance of the infrastructure network subject to disinformation campaigns? (iii) How can we manage infrastructure network operations and counter disinformation in concert to avoid shortages and satisfy user demands? To answer these questions, we develop a hybrid approach that integrates an epidemiological model of disinformation spread (based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, or SIR) with an efficient mixed-integer programming optimization model for infrastructure network performance. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the best protection and response actions against disinformation to minimize the general shortage of commodities at different nodes over time. The proposed model is illustrated with a case study involving a subset of the western US interconnection grid located in Los Angeles County in California.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16832-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Characteristics such as automatic flight control, flight time, and image acquisition have fueled various computer-vision tasks, providing better efficiency and usefulness than fixed viewing surveillance cameras. However, in constrained scenarios, the number of UAV-based aerial datasets is still low, which comparatively focuses on specific tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we present a high-resolution UAV-based image-dataset, named “NITRDrone” focusing on aerial image segmentation tasks especially extracting the road networks from the aerial images. The images and video sequences in this dataset are captured over different locations of the NITR campus area, covering around 650 acres. Thus, it provides many diversified scenarios to be considered while analyzing aerial images. In particular, the dataset is prepared to address the existing challenges in UAV-based aerial image segmentation problems. Extensive experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed dataset to address the aerial segmentation problems through the existing state-of-the-art methodologies. Out of the considered baseline methodologies, U-Net performs the best with an intersection of union (IoU) of 0.77, followed DeepLabplusException (IoU: 0.74) and SegNet (IoU: 0.68).

In instances where blinking is consequential, eye state recognition plays a critical part for the development of human–machine interaction (HMI) solutions. To accomplish this objective, pre-trained CNN architectures on ImageNet were first trained on the both dataset, which included both open and closed-eye states, and then they were tested, and their performance was quantified. The AlexNet design has proven to be more successful owing to these assessments. The ZJU and CEW datasets were leveraged to train the DCNN architecture, which was constructed employing AlexNet modifications for performance enhancement. On the both datasets, the suggested DCNN architecture was tested for performance. The achieved DCNN design was found to have 97.32% accuracy, 95.37% sensitivity, 97.97% specificity, 93.99% precision, 94.67% F 1 score, and 99.37% AUC values in the ZJU dataset, while it was found to have 97.93% accuracy, 98.74% sensitivity, 97.15% specificity, 97.11% precision, 97.92% F 1 score, and 99.69% AUC values in the CEW dataset. Accordingly, when compared to CNN architectures, it scored the maximum performance. At the same time, the DCNN architecture proposed on the ZJU and CEW datasets has been confirmed to be an acceptable and productive solution for eye state recognition depending on the outcomes compared to the studies in the literature.

The former has the disadvantage of giving birth to singularities and the latter being algorithmically complex. This work presents a hybrid solution, combining the benefits of both, namely a quaternion approach leveraging the Lagrangian framework, connecting the singularity-free parameterization with the algorithmic simplicity of the Lagrangian approach. We do so by offering detailed insights into the kinematic modeling process and the formulation of the dynamics of a general aerial manipulator.

FL allows a group of users (often referred to as clients ) to locally train a single machine learning model on their devices without sharing their raw data. One of the main challenges in FL is how to select the most appropriate clients to participate in the training of a certain task. In this paper, we address this challenge and propose a trust-based deep reinforcement learning approach to select the most adequate clients in terms of resource consumption and training time. On top of the client selection mechanism, we embed a transfer learning approach to handle the scarcity of data in some regions and compensate potential lack of learning at some servers. We apply our solution in the healthcare domain in a COVID-19 detection scenario over IoT devices. In the considered scenario, edge servers collaborate with IoT devices to train a COVID-19 detection model using FL without having to share any raw confidential data.

To deal with this, an intelligent mechanism is required.Therefore, this work proposes a novel Neuro-fuzzy based intelligent traffic light control system, which accounts for vehicle heterogeneity by dynamically generating traffic light phase duration considering the real-time heterogeneous traffic load. For this purpose, the proposed model establishes peer-to-peer connections among neighboring traffic light junctions to fetch the respective real-time traffic conditions and congestion. A fuzzy membership function is utilized to generate an intelligent traffic light phase duration. Further, to obtain an effective fuzzy membership function input value considering real-time heterogeneous traffic scenarios, an adaptive neural network is utilized.

In this work, we present a novel method for real-time environment exploration, whose only requirements are a visually similar dataset for pre-training, enough lighting in the scene, and an on-board forward-looking RGB camera for environmental sensing. As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step.

In addition, man-to-machine digital data handling has magnified the information wave by a large magnitude. There has been a pronounced increase in digital applications in agricultural management, which has impinged on information and communication technology (ICT) to provide benefits for both producers and consumers as well as leading to technological solutions being pushed into a rural setting. This paper showcases the potential ICT technologies in traditional agriculture, as well as the issues to be encountered when they are applied to farming practices. The challenges of robotics, IoT devices, and machine learning, as well as the roles of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sensors used in agriculture, are all described in detail.

Article,doi:10.1631/FITEE.2100594,Coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for unexpected crashed agents,Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering,10.1631/FITEE.2100594,Springer,2022-07-01,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning is difficult to apply in practice, partially because of the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios. One reason for the gap is that simulated systems always assume that agents can work normally all the time, while in practice, one or more agents may unexpectedly “crash” during the coordination process due to inevitable hardware or software failures. Such crashes destroy the cooperation among agents and lead to performance degradation. In this work, we present a formal conceptualization of a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning system with unexpected crashes. To enhance the robustness of the system to crashes, we propose a coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that introduces a virtual coach agent to adjust the crash rate during training. We have designed three coaching strategies (fixed crash rate, curriculum learning, and adaptive crash rate) and a re-sampling strategy for our coach agent. To our knowledge, this work is the first to study unexpected crashes in a multi-agent system. Extensive experiments on grid-world and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive strategy compared with the fixed crash rate strategy and curriculum learning strategy. The ablation study further illustrates the effectiveness of our re-sampling strategy. 多智能体强化学习在实际场景中很难应用, 一部分原因在于模拟环境和现实环境之间存在差距。造成这种差距的一个原因是, 模拟系统总是假设智能体可以一直正常工作, 而实际上, 由于不可避免的硬件或软件故障, 一个或多个智能体可能会在合作过程中意外 “崩溃”。这样的崩溃会破坏智能体之间的合作, 导致系统性能下降。本文中, 我们给出了意外崩溃情况下合作多智能体强化学习系统的正式定义。为增强系统应对崩溃时的鲁棒性, 提出教练辅助多智能体强化学习框架, 其在训练过程中引入一个虚拟教练智能体, 以调整系统的崩溃概率。为教练智能体设计了3种教练策略和重采样策略。据我们所知, 这是研究多智能体系统中意外崩溃情况的首项工作。在网格环境和星际争霸微管理任务上的大量实验表明, 相比固定崩溃概率和课程学习的教练策略, 自适应策略更加有效。消融实验进一步展现了重采样策略的有效性。",http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/FITEE.2100594,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Edge resources need to be utilized efficiently to fulfill the growing demand for a large number of IoT devices. Lots of work has been done for the efficient utilization of edge resources. This paper provided a systematic review of fog resource management literature from the year 2016–2021. In this review paper, the fog resource management approaches are divided into 9 categories which include resource scheduling, application placement, load balancing, resource allocation, resource estimation, task offloading, resource provisioning, resource discovery, and resource orchestration. These resource management approaches are further subclassified based on the technology used, QoS factors, and data-driven strategies. Comparative analysis of existing articles is provided based on technology, tools, application area, and QoS factors.

In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning framework for secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving computational intelligence, called Decentralized Computational Intelligence as a Service (DCIaaS), is proposed.

Many real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, traffic signals, and industrial automation can now be trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. These applications are designed to take benefit of DRL in order to improve the monitoring as well as measurements in industrial internet of things for automation identification system. The complexity of these environments means that it is more appropriate to use multi-agent systems rather than a single-agent. However, in non-stationary environments multi-agent systems can suffer from increased number of observations, limiting the scalability of algorithms. This study proposes a model to tackle the problem of scalability in DRL algorithms in transportation domain. A partition-based approach is used in the proposed model to reduce the complexity of the environment. This partition-based approach helps agents to stay in their working area. This reduces the complexity of the learning environment and the number of observations for each agent. The proposed model uses generative adversarial imitation learning and behavior cloning, combined with a proximal policy optimization algorithm, for training multiple agents in a dynamic environment.

Existence of universal adversarial perturbations could empower the cases where could not generate the image-dependent adversarial examples, which are known to be very successful on image classification. Previous work are mainly optimization-based, which take a long time to search perturbations, and the obtained adversarial examples are not so real and can be easily defensed. Moreover the researches on universal adversarial perturbation against vision-language systems are few. In our work, we novelly construct a GenerAtive Network for Universal Adversarial Perturbations, dubbed as UAP-GAN, to study the robustness of image classification and captioning systems, based on convolutional neural networks and plus recurrent neural networks, respectively. Specifically, our proposed UAP-GAN improves the framework of GAN to compute universal adversarial perturbations, with the input of a fixed random noise. Comparing to existing methods, our UAP-GAN method has four main characteristics: fast generation, high attack success rate, close to natural image, yet difficult to defense. In addition, our proposed model could produce image-agnostic perturbations for targeted and non-targeted attacks, according to the selected scene. In the end, our comprehensive experiments on MSCOCO and ImageNet, demonstrate the clear superiority to the existing work, and also prove that our UAP-GAN architecture could effectively fool the image captioning and classification models with splendid results, yet avoid the redesign of framework for different tasks.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-022-01058-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

First, it provides a critical analysis of current efforts to establish practical mechanisms for algorithmic auditing and assessment to identify limitations and gaps with these approaches.

Third, it generalises this method to incorporate wider ethical, social, and legal considerations, in turn establishing a novel version of argument-based assurance that we call ‘ethical assurance.’ Ethical assurance is presented as a structured method for unifying the myriad practical mechanisms that have been proposed. It is built on a process-based form of project governance that enlists reflective innovation practices to operationalise normative principles, such as sustainability, accountability, transparency, fairness, and explainability. As a set of interlocutory governance mechanisms that span across the data science and AI lifecycle, ethical assurance supports inclusive and participatory ethical deliberation while also remaining grounded in social and technical realities.

In autonomous driving, the appearance of incomplete point clouds that lose geometric and semantic information is inevitable due to the limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The existence of incomplete point clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to a reduction in the accuracy of object detection, traffic alerts, and collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles. Existing point cloud completion networks, such as the Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of point cloud completion without considering the efficiency of the inference process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving accurately and efficiently. In the proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm that combines incremental sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improve the inference speed of the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and autonomous driving scenes are created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5 different sizes are used for three autonomous driving situations. The improved PF-Net can achieve speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10723-022-09610-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many existing mobile applications have been developed to assist users in locating a nearby AED. However, these applications do not provide indoor navigation to the AED location. The time required to locate an AED inside a building due to a lack of indoor navigation systems will reduce the patient’s chance of survival. The existing indoor navigation solutions either require special hardware, a large dataset or a significant amount of initial work. These requirements make these systems not viable for implementation on a large-scale. Methods The proposed system collects Wi-Fi information from the existing devices and the path’s magnetic information using a smartphone to guide the user from a starting point to an AED. The information collected is processed using four techniques: turn detection method, Magnetic data pattern matching method, Wi-Fi fingerprinting method and Closest Wi-Fi location method to estimate user location. The user location estimations from all four techniques are further processed to determine the user’s location on the path, which is then used to guide the user to the AED location. Results The four techniques used in the proposed system Turn detection , Magnetic data pattern matching , Closest Wi-Fi location and Wi-Fi fingerprinting can individually achieve the accuracy of 80% with the error distance ± 9.4 m, ± 2.4 m, ± 4.6 m, and ± 4.6 m respectively. These four techniques, applied individually, may not always provide stable results. Combining these techniques results in a robust system with an overall accuracy of 80% with an error distance of ± 2.74 m. In comparison, the proposed system’s accuracy is higher than the existing systems that use Wi-Fi and magnetic data. Conclusion This research proposes a novel approach that requires no special hardware, large scale data or significant initial work to provide indoor navigation. The proposed system AEDNav can achieve an accuracy similar to the existing indoor navigation systems. Implementing this indoor navigation system could reduce the time to locate an AED and ultimately increase patient survival during sudden cardiac arrest.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-022-01886-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The provider typically allocates backup resources to mitigate the risk of violating the SLA-specified uptime guarantee. However, initial backups may need to be adjusted in response to real-time failure and recovery events. In this study, we first develop a recurrent intervention at fixed intervals (RIFI) strategy that allows the provider to adjust the allocation of backup resources such that the expected total cost is minimized. Next, we focus on the limit to number of interventions, starting from single intervention strategy, as frequent reallocations may be operationally disruptive. Particularly, we provide a cost minimization approach to guide the service providers in their virtual resources management, and a specific downtime minimization approach for more mission-critical applications as a more aggressive alternative. We present computational results exploring the impact of intervention on the likelihood of SLA violation for the rest of the contract period, and evaluate parameters such as time and quantum of resource level adjustment, penalty levels desired by clients, and their influences on the backup resource provisioning strategies. We also validate our models through the analysis of use cases from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.

The existing model-free approaches for solving the synchronization problem in the presence of disturbances do not specify the rate of convergence, whereas this paper does. For this purpose, to ensure the synchronization of followers with the leader at the desired rate, a novel observer-based H ∞ control protocol is developed to prevent the effect of disturbance that propagates through the network. The problem is then formulated as an optimal control problem, and a modified off-policy RL algorithm is presented to solve the synchronization problem in real time without requiring any knowledge of the agents' dynamics. It is shown that the proposed method not only guarantees the synchronization of the normal agents but also attenuates the effect of disturbance both at the desired rate.

Despite systematic literature reviews identifying the main characteristics of existing tools and the SPL activities they support, these reviews do not always help to understand if such tools provide what complex variability projects demand. This paper presents an empirical research in which we evaluate the degree of maturity of existing SPL tools focusing on their support of variability modeling characteristics and SPL engineering activities required by current application domains. We first identify the characteristics and activities that are essential for the development of SPLs by analyzing a selected sample of case studies chosen from application domains with high variability. Second, we conduct an exploratory study to analyze whether the existing tools support those characteristics and activities. We conclude that, with the current tool support, it is possible to develop a basic SPL approach. But we have also found out that these tools present several limitations when dealing with complex variability requirements demanded by emergent application domains, such as non-Boolean features or large configuration spaces. Additionally, we identify the necessity for an integrated approach with appropriate tool support to completely cover all the activities and phases of SPL engineering.

The investigation constructs multiple risk forecasts that are synthesised in a new framework for counteracting risks from artificial intelligence (AI) itself. In other words, the research in this article is not just concerned with securing a system, but also analysing how the system responds when (internal and external) failure(s) and compromise(s) occur. This is an important methodological principle because not all systems can be secured, and totally securing a system is not feasible. Thus, we need to construct algorithms that will enable systems to continue operating even when parts of the system have been compromised. Furthermore, the article forecasts emerging cyber-risks from the integration of AI in cybersecurity. Based on the forecasts, the article is concentrated on creating synergies between the existing literature, the data sources identified in the survey, and forecasts. The forecasts are used to increase the feasibility of the overall research and enable the development of novel methodologies that uses AI to defend from cyber risks. The methodology is focused on addressing the risk of AI attacks, as well as to forecast the value of AI in defence and in the prevention of AI rogue devices acting independently.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12530-022-09431-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, to date, there has not been much direct comparison between the classical and emerging paradigms to this problem. In this article, we survey recent works that apply machine learning for motion planning and control in mobile robot navigation, within the context of classical navigation systems.

Even though AI-powered systems have brought competitive advantages, the black-box nature makes them lack transparency and prevents them from explaining their decisions. This issue has motivated the introduction of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which promotes AI algorithms that can show their internal process and explain how they made decisions. The number of XAI research has increased significantly in recent years, but there lacks a unified and comprehensive review of the latest XAI progress. This review aims to bridge the gap by discovering the critical perspectives of the rapidly growing body of research associated with XAI. After offering the readers a solid XAI background, we analyze and review various XAI methods, which are grouped into (i) pre-modeling explainability, (ii) interpretable model, and (iii) post-modeling explainability. We also pay attention to the current methods that dedicate to interpret and analyze deep learning methods. In addition, we systematically discuss various XAI challenges, such as the trade-off between the performance and the explainability, evaluation methods, security, and policy.

High throughput phenotyping (HTP) involves the application of these tools to phenotype the plants and can vary from ground-based imaging to aerial phenotyping to remote sensing. Adoption of these HTP tools has tried to reduce the phenotyping bottleneck in breeding programs and help to increase the pace of genetic gain. More specifically, several root phenotyping tools are discussed to study the plant’s hidden half and an area long neglected. However, the use of these HTP technologies produces big data sets that impede the inference from those datasets. Machine learning and deep learning provide an alternative opportunity for the extraction of useful information for making conclusions. These are interdisciplinary approaches for data analysis using probability, statistics, classification, regression, decision theory, data visualization, and neural networks to relate information extracted with the phenotypes obtained. These techniques use feature extraction, identification, classification, and prediction criteria to identify pertinent data for use in plant breeding and pathology activities. This review focuses on the recent findings where machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used for plant stress phenotyping with data being collected using various HTP platforms. We have provided a comprehensive overview of different machine learning and deep learning tools available with their potential advantages and pitfalls. Overall, this review provides an avenue for studying various HTP platforms with particular emphasis on using the machine learning and deep learning tools for drawing legitimate conclusions.

First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations . Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit , a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019.

WSN is utilized to monitor, report, and supervise tasks or events occurring in the environment. The relaying of data in such systems takes place by utilizing different routing schemes. These routing schemes were proposed to augment the throughput of communication networks.

The transmission of data (to and fro) related to these applications occur between the drones and the other infrastructure over wireless channels that must abide to the stringent latency restrictions. However, relaying this data to the core cloud infrastructure may lead to a higher round trip delay. Thus, we utilize the cloud close to the ground, i.e., edge computing to realize an edge-envisioned IoD ecosystem. However, as this data is relayed over an open communication channel, it is often prone to different types of attacks due to it wider attack surface. Thus, we need to find a robust solution that can maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data while providing desired services. Blockchain technology is capable to handle these challenges owing to the distributed ledger that store the data immutably. However, the conventional block architecture pose several challenges because of limited computational capabilities of drones. As the size of blockchain increases, the data flow also increases and so does the associated challenges. Hence, to overcome these challenges, in this work, we have proposed a derived blockchain architecture that decouples the data part (or block ledger) from the block header and shifts it to off-chain storage. In our approach, the registration of a new drone is performed to enable legitimate access control thus ensuring identity management and traceability. Further, the interactions happen in the form of transactions of the blockchain. We propose a lightweight consensus mechanism based on the stochastic selection followed by a transaction signing process to ensure that each drone is in control of its block. The proposed scheme also handles the expanding storage requirements with the help of data compression using a shrinking block mechanism. Lastly, the problem of additional delay anticipated due to drone mobility is handled using a multi-level caching mechanism. The proposed work has been validated in a simulated Gazebo environment and the results are promising in terms of different metrics.

One of the most extensively used strategies for big data classification is MapReduce, which combines the map and reduce processes. For filtering and sorting, the mapping approach is employed, and the reduction technique is used to combine the final classification results. A novel Archerfish Hunter Spotted Hyena Optimization-based Improved Extreme Learning Machine (AHSHO-IELM) classifier-based MapReduce framework is proposed in this paper for big data classification. The IELM algorithm is formed by integrating the ELM technique with Principal Component Analysis to overcome the multicollinear problem and enhance the training and testing time. The AHSHO method combines the archerfish hunter optimization and Spotted Hyena Optimization algorithms to improve the optimal parameter selection of the IELM classifier, which increases classification accuracy and reduces the error rate. The performance of the proposed AHSHO-IELM classifier-based MapReduce framework is evaluated using different performance metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Computational time, F1-Score, Mathews correlation coefficient, and scale-up factor.

In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a confidence calibration method for deep neural networks by designing one novel knowledge reverse distillation strategy. Traditional knowledge distillation strategy takes the accuracy as the knowledge, and transfers it from the teacher network (usually one complex deep network) to the student network (usually one simple network). Different from this traditional distillation strategy, the proposed knowledge reverse distillation strategy regards the confidence as the knowledge, and constructs one reverse knowledge transfer pathway by applying the confidence knowledge in the simple network to calibrate the complex deep network. Experimental results on three benchmark image datasets show that the knowledge reverse distillation strategy can effectively improve the calibration capability of complex networks so that the complex deep neural network captures the high confidence along with the high prediction accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-022-10885-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Vehicles continuously exchange and collect information to provide innovative transportation services; for example, traffic management, navigation, autonomous driving, and the generation of alerts. However, VANETs are extremely challenging for data collection, due to their high mobility and dynamic network topologies that cause frequent link disruptions and make path discovery difficult. In this survey, various state-of-the-art data collection protocols for VANETs are discussed, based on three broad categories, i.e., delay-tolerant, best-effort, and real-time protocols. A taxonomy is designed for data collection protocols for VANETs that is essential to add precision and ease of understandability. A detailed comparative analysis among various data collection protocols is provided to highlight their functionalities and features. Protocols are evaluated based on three parametric phases. First, protocols investigation based on six necessary parameters, including delivery and drop ratio, efficiency, and recovery strategy. Second, a 4-D functional framework is designed to fit most data collection protocols for quick classification and mobility model identification, thus eradicating the need to read extensive literature. In the last, in-depth categorical mapping is performed to deep dive for better and targeted interpretation.

In critiquing focus on the drone’s apparent ‘autonomy’, it argues that such devices function as part of a socio-technical network. They are relational parts of human–machine interaction that, in our changing geopolitical realities, have a powerful influence on politics, reputation and warfare. Drawing on Žižek’s conception of parallax, the article stresses the importance of culture and perception in forming the role of the drone in widening power asymmetries. It examines how perceptions of autonomy are evoked by drones, to claim that this misperception is a smokescreen that obscures the relational socio-technical realities of the drone. The article therefore argues that a more critical culture of the drone emerges by shifting the focus and perception from autonomy to anonymity. This allows us to engage more fully with the distributed agency and decision-making that define how drones are developed and deployed. Rather than focusing on the drone as a singular, fetishised, technical object, a relational approach to the drone assemblage is proposed that highlights the competing human interests that define and resist drones in global politics and culture.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01042-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1007/s11263-022-01604-w,Sparse Black-Box Video Attack with Reinforcement Learning,International Journal of Computer Vision,10.1007/s11263-022-01604-w,Springer,2022-06-01,"Adversarial attacks on video recognition models have been explored recently. However, most existing works treat each video frame equally and ignore their temporal interactions. To overcome this drawback, a few methods try to select some key frames and then perform attacks based on them. Unfortunately, their selection strategy is independent of the attacking step, therefore the resulting performance is limited. Instead, we argue the frame selection phase is closely relevant with the attacking phase. The key frames should be adjusted according to the attacking results. For that, we formulate the black-box video attacks into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Specifically, the environment in RL is set as the recognition model, and the agent in RL plays the role of frame selecting. By continuously querying the recognition models and receiving the attacking feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its frame selection strategy and adversarial perturbations become smaller and smaller. We conduct a series of experiments with two mainstream video recognition models: C3D and LRCN on the public UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets.

Hence, demands for implementing AI ethics and ethicists into AI organizations, especially corporations, are ubiquitous. However, the assumption that AI ethicists have particular epistemological advantages compared to non-ethicists as well as the idea that AI ethics automatically decreases the likelihood of unethical outcomes are both flawed. Therefore, this comment lists risks that either originate from AI ethicists themselves or from the consequences their embedding in AI organizations has. The compilation of risks comprises psychological considerations concerning the cognitive biases of AI ethicists themselves as well as biased reactions to their work, subject-specific and knowledge constraints AI ethicists often succumb to, negative side effects of ethics audits for AI applications, and many more.

Pro-social rule breaking as a moral enhancement approach for ethical AI,AI & SOCIETY,10.1007/s00146-022-01478-z,Springer,2022-05-23,"We are moving towards a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) based agents make many decisions on behalf of humans. From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a study that introduces a ‘ vaccination strategy dilemma’ to human participants and analyzes their response. In this dilemma , one needs to decide whether they would distribute COVID-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm.

Affected by GPS equipment precision and driving environments, raw GPS trajectories will deviate from the paths that vehicles really drove on. Such inaccurate data is not beneficial to the upstream applications. Therefore, map matching is applied to identify the true driving paths in the road network from the GPS trajectories data. A lot of studies in the filed of map matching have been proposed, but there still exist three problems: (1) there lacks a comprehensive review on recent map matching algorithms with new techniques; (2) the existing map-matching algorithms still fail to meet the requirements of both high precision and high efficiency simultaneously; (3) there is a lack of comparison between various types of matching algorithms on a unified experimental environment. In this paper, we review the existing matching algorithms and propose a new categorisation based on their methodologies.

Such systems are increasingly ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable situations where moral responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any particular person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility for humans; however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet inexistent, making the development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging. In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying, through an iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for AI-based systems under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of two applications scenarios: automated vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that human’s ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We argue that these four properties will support practically minded professionals to take concrete steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-022-00167-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Most of the data has been collected using the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which must be saved in the cloud for further analysis.

During data transmission, data security is managed by applying the noise protocol framework encryption process. The encryption technique utilized the various cryptographic functions that effectively manage the privacy and security of the data.

The DRL is used in fog devices to classify the vehicles and intelligently allocate the vacant parking slots to vehicles.

When multiple services running on the resource-constrained CAVs, how limited resources can dynamically support the desired services is of the utmost importance for both automakers and domain researchers. In this context, efficiently and dynamically managing vehicle services becomes critical for autonomous driving. While previous research focused on service scheduling, computation offloading, and virtual machine migration, we propose EdgeWare, an extensible and flexible middleware to manage the execution of vehicle services, which is open-source to the community with four key features: i ) on-demand model switch, i.e.,  easily switch and upgrade machine learning models, ii ) function consolidation and deduplication to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating functions and maximize the reusability of vehicle services, iii ) build event-driven applications to reduce workload, and iv ) dynamic workflow customization which enables customizing workflow to extend the functionality. Our experiment results show that EdgeWare accelerates the execution of services about 2.6 $$\times$$ × faster compared to the silo approach and save CPU and memory utilization up to around 50% and 17% respectively, and it allows domain researchers to dynamically add new services on CAVs or easily switch to the upgraded applications for the life cycle management of vehicle services.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42514-022-00100-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the literature many end-to-end methods have been used in simulators to drive a car and to apply the learnt strategies to avoid the obstacles using the lane changing, following the vehicle as per the traffic rules, driving in-between the lane boundaries, and many more behaviors. The proposed method is designed to avoid obstacles in the scenarios where a dynamic obstacle is headed directly towards the robot from different directions. To avoid the critical encounter of the dynamic obstacles, we trained a novel deep neural network (DNN) with two specific behavioral obstacle avoidance strategies, namely “head-on collision avoidance” and “stop and move” . These two strategies of obstacle avoidance come from the human behavior of obstacle avoidance. Looking at the current frame only, for a very similar visual display of the scenario, the two strategies have contrasting outputs and overall outcomes that makes learning very difficult. A random data recording over general simulations is unlikely to record the corner cases of both behaviors that rarely occur, and a behavior-specific training used in this paper intensifies the same cases for a better learning of the robot in such corner cases. We calculate the intention of the obstacle, whether it will move or not.

In this context, knowledge representation and processing have recently shown a significant contribution to the simulation modeling domain, where knowledge graphs have been used in different fields to build knowledge representations for multiple purposes. In this paper, we introduce VOWES, a Virtual Outdoor Weather Event Simulator to replicate and measure outdoor weather events in vivid 3D visualizations. We design and implement an integrated knowledge graph (KG) representation for VOWES, by creating two constituent KGs: (i) Weather KG describing weather data and events, and (ii) Simulator KG describing 3D simulation components and properties, and connecting them with the (iii) Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) KG to form an integrated structure serving as the knowledge backbone of the VOWES simulation environment. We make use of the Unity 3D engine to build and design the simulator environment and its virtual sensors, and integrate the Mapbox SDK and the WeatherStack API for realistic real-world weather mapping. We have conducted qualitative evaluations involving 13 expert and 30 non-expert testers, to assess the quality of VOWES’ KGs and its simulation environment. Results show that more than 80% of the testers gave a combined quality score ≥ 3 out of 4 on most evaluation criteria. We have also conducted performance evaluations to test VOWES loading, execution, and data search time, among other features. Results show that most operations require almost instantaneous or linear time, where search, refresh, and export operations share almost identical performance levels, with execution time increasing by approximately 179 μs for every added game object.

Thereby, however, significant ethical concerns arise, including issues of fairness, privacy and human autonomy. By aggregating current concerns and criticisms, we identify five crucial shortcomings of the current debate on the ethics of AI. On the threshold of a third wave of AI ethics, we find that the field eventually fails to take sufficient account of the business context and deep societal value conflicts the use of AI systems may evoke. For even a perfectly fair AI system, regardless of its feasibility, may be ethically problematic, a too narrow focus on the ethical implications of technical systems alone seems insufficient. Therefore, we introduce a business ethics perspective based on the normative theory of contractualism and conceptualise ethical implications as conflicts between values of diverse stakeholders. We argue that such value conflicts can be resolved by an account of deliberative order ethics holding that stakeholders of an economic community deliberate the costs and benefits and agree on rules for acceptable trade-offs when AI systems are employed. This allows AI ethics to consider business practices, to recognise the role of firms, and ethical AI not being at risk to provide a competitive disadvantage or in conflict with the current functioning of economic markets. By introducing deliberative order ethics, we thus seek to do justice to the fundamental normative and political dimensions at the core of AI ethics.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-021-00047-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the continually changing topology and lack of security infrastructure, routing protocols in VANET are vulnerable to several attacks. In this paper, we focus on the black hole and the gray hole attacks due to its severity. In black hole and gray hole attacks, the attacker gains access to the wireless network and drops the received packets fully/selectively that impacts on the safety applications of VANET. This paper presents a novel security approach called Smart Blackhole and Gray hole Mitigation (SBGM) to detect and mitigate both black hole and gray hole nodes in VANET using a time series analysis of the dropped packets of each node. The computation of the packet drop distance threshold based on Dynamic Time Warping improves the detection accuracy in SBGM. We assess the performance of SBGM using AODV and OLSR routing protocols under low-dense and high-dense traffic scenarios in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, Throughput, Average End-to-End Delay, and Packet Drop percentage.

However, it has had many drawbacks on people’s health and the environment. Several paradigms have been proposed and implemented in an effort to suppress and reverse the adverse impacts of human activities and industrialization. A popular approach that serves as a solution to many of the negative implications of industry today is the circular economy (CE). With today’s top-notch technologies, the transition from the conventional linear economy to CE has been made easier. For example, the implementation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) tool, within a CE can substantially increase efficiency and reduce waste. This work presents a thorough review on the applications of cyber-physical systems within each of the CE stages, the contribution of different CPS technologies to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and the current state of the CE assessment tools. The contribution of different CPS tools to each CE stage is demonstrated through several practical examples. In addition, this work reveals how the different CPS technologies applications contribute to the attainment of different SDGs set by the United Nations. It is also deduced from the review of the current state of the CE assessment tools that there is a need for a standardized comprehensive CE measuring or rating system to allow businesses on the micro, meso, and macro levels of the economy improve their circulatory.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40684-021-00398-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Everyone makes use of their vehicles like two-wheelers or four-wheelers to reach the destination. Vehicle condition plays a major role which includes many parameters such as tyre condition, engine overheating, low fuel mileage. This paper concentrates on the examination of tyre track design for deformities. The mileage of a vehicle relies upon different components. However, it depends on different parameters like street condition, tyre weight and numerous others. For smooth driving and for safe traffic reasons, the auspicious maintenance of tyres plays a vital task. Consequently, the likelihood of prediction of tyre imperfections is assumed to play a vital role to fleet proprietors, government and tyre makers. Researchers make use of recent technologies such as machine learning and deep learning concepts to provide a solution to various real-life problems. The creation of a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network with the purpose of discovery of imperfections on tyres by the examination of pictures of tyre track designs is being proposed. The proposed system with the accessible data-set made public by different tyre producers is included for evaluation. The consequences of our tests demonstrate that it is conceivable to predict the deformities and durability of a tyre from its track designs through a weighted quality-based convolutional neural network. The proposed methodology is used to identify the group of feature values from the tyre image. These kinds of feature values are utilized to implement the dissimilarity of the feature related pixels. The number of epochs is varied as a callback mechanism has been used to validate the proposed model. Binary accuracy and mean absolute error are the best metrics to evaluate the performance which are discussed in the results section.

However, locating equipment in such GPS denied environments is very time consuming due to the complexity of the environment and the large amount of equipment. To address this challenge we investigate an alternative approach to study the navigation problem based on visual imagery data instead of current ad-hoc methods where engineering drawings or large CAD models are used to find equipment. In particular, this paper investigates the combination of deep learning and decomposition for the image retrieval problem which is central for visual navigation. A convolutional neural network is first used to extract relevant features from the image database. The database is then decomposed into clusters of visually similar images, where several algorithms have been explored in order to make the clusters as independent as possible. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach is then applied on each cluster to build a vocabulary forest. During the searching process the vocabulary forest is exploited to find the most relevant images to the query image. To validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out using both standard datasets and images from industrial environments. We show that the suggested approach outperforms the BoW-based image retrieval solutions, both in terms of computing time and accuracy.

Processing generated data from IoT devices and actuation warranted in real-time requires computational infrastructure near the edge to get the outcome without delay. Emerging edge technologies such as Fog computing, Multi-Access Edge Computing, and Cloudlet provide computing resources near the edge, i.e. closer to the IoT devices, where devices can place their services/applications or offload their computational job for processing. The utilization of computing resources provided by emerging edge technologies addresses the issue of delay in the outcome and increases the battery life of IoT devices/End-user devices. Computational resources provided by the edge technologies, i.e. edge/fog nodes, can be heterogeneous, dynamic and mobile. Therefore, service placement and computation offloading on edge/fog nodes are challenging issues, and the problem to finding the best suitable fog/edge nodes is NP-Hard. Nature-inspired algorithms provide robust solutions to NP-Hard problems. Nowadays, nature-inspired algorithms have been widely applied for resource allocation for service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge technologies. In this work, we provide a detailed study on the applications of nature-inspired algorithms in emerging edge computing domains. We provide an overview of emerging edge technologies, related quality parameters and nature-inspired algorithms followed by the basic formulation of service placement and computation offloading in emerging edge computing systems. In this work, we classify the works in emerging edge computing applying nature-inspired algorithms into two categories: works related to service placement and works related to offloading.

Directly applying existing models to tackle real-time pedestrian and vehicle detection tasks captured by high speed moving vehicle scenarios has two problems. First, the target scale varies drastically because the vehicle speed changes greatly. Second, captured images contain both tiny targets and high density targets, which brings in occlusion between targets. To solve the two issues, an efficient light weight real-time detection algorithm is proposed, which is referred to as EfficientLiteDet. Based on Tiny-YOLOv4, one more prediction head is introduced in the proposed model to detect multi-scale targets effectively. In order to detect tiny and occluded denser targets, we used Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) instead of original anchor detection heads in our model. To explore the potential of self-attention mechanism in TPH, the proposed model integrates “convolutional block attention model” to locate crucial attention region on scenarios with denser targets. Further to improve the detection performance of our model, we applied various data augmentation strategies such as mosaic, mix-up, multi-scale, and random-horizontal-flip during the model training. Extensive experiments are conducted on five challenging pedestrian and vehicle datasets shows that the EfficientLiteDet model has better performance in real-time scenarios. On Pascal Voc-2007, Highway and Udacity datasets, the proposed model achieves mean average precision (mAP) 87.3%, 80.1% and 77.8%, respectively, which is quite better than Tiny-YOLOv4 state-of-the-art algorithm by + 2.4%, 1.8% and + 2.4%, respectively.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-022-01293-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The first task is a speaker recognition application, trying to identify five different speakers. The second one is a speech command identification where the goal is to classify ten voice commands. These two tasks are very important to make the communication between humans and smart devices as smooth and natural as possible. The emergence of smart home devices such as personal assistants and the deployment of audio based applications in noisy environments raise new challenges and reveal the weaknesses of existing speech recognition systems. Despite the advances of deep learning in audio tasks, most of the proposed architectures are computationally inefficient and very sensitive to noise. This research addresses these problems by proposing two neural architectures that incorporate a novel pooling operation, named entropy pooling. Entropy pooling is based on the principle of maximum entropy. A detailed ablation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of entropy pooling against the classic max and average pooling layers. The neural networks that are developed are based on two architectures, convolutional networks and residual ones. The study shows that entropy based feature pooling improves the robustness of these architectures in the presence of noise.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12931-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, including it in so-called “safety-critical” systems such as automotive or aeronautic has proven to be very challenging, since the shift in paradigm that ML brings completely changes traditional certification approaches. Objective This paper aims to elucidate challenges related to the certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question “How to Certify Machine Learning Based Safety-critical Systems?”. Method We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of research papers published between 2015 and 2020, covering topics related to the certification of ML systems. In total, we identified 217 papers covering topics considered to be the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness , Uncertainty , Explainability , Verification , Safe Reinforcement Learning , and Direct Certification . We analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries of the papers extracted. Results The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of ML models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between academia and industries to deepen the domain study.

In this context, a social robot that adapts its behaviour to different users and proactively suggests their favourite activities may produce a more successful interaction. In this work, we describe how the autonomous decision-making system embedded in our social robot Mini can produce a personalised interactive communication experience by considering the preferences of the user the robot interacts with. We compared the performance of Top Label as Class and Ranking by Pairwise Comparison, two promising algorithms in the area, to find the one that best predicts the user preferences. Although both algorithms provide robust results in preference prediction, we decided to integrate Ranking by Pairwise Comparison since it provides better estimations. The method proposed in this contribution allows the autonomous decision-making system of the robot to work on different modes, balancing activity exploration with the selection of the favourite entertaining activities. The operation of the preference learning system is shown in three real case studies where the decision-making system works differently depending on the user the robot is facing. Then, we conducted a human–robot interaction experiment to investigate whether the robot users perceive the personalised selection of activities more appropriate than selecting the activities at random. The results show how the study participants found the personalised activity selection more appropriate, improving their likeability towards the robot and how intelligent they perceive the system. query Please check the edit made in the article title.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-022-09321-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Article,doi:10.1038/s41598-022-08942-2,Addressing the range anxiety of battery electric vehicles with charging en route,Scientific Reports,10.1038/s41598-022-08942-2,Nature,2022-04-04,"Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles due to benefits in improved fuel economy, lower operating cost, and reduced emission. BEVs use electric motors rather than fossil fuels for propulsion and typically store electric energy in lithium-ion cells. With rising concerns over fossil fuel depletion and the impact of ICE vehicles on the climate, electric mobility is widely considered as the future of sustainable transportation. BEVs promise to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the transportation sector. However, mass adoption of BEVs faces major barriers due to consumer worries over several important battery-related issues, such as limited range, long charging time, lack of charging stations, and high initial cost. Existing solutions to overcome these barriers, such as building more charging stations, increasing battery capacity, and stationary vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging, often suffer from prohibitive investment costs, incompatibility to existing BEVs, or long travel delays. In this paper, we propose P eer-to- P eer C ar C harging (P2C2), a scalable approach for charging BEVs that alleviates the need for elaborate charging infrastructure. The central idea is to enable BEVs to share charge among each other while in motion through coordination with a cloud-based control system. To re-vitalize a BEV fleet, which is continuously in motion, we introduce Mobile Charging Stations (MoCS), which are high-battery-capacity vehicles used to replenish the overall charge in a vehicle network. Unlike existing V2V charging solutions, the charge sharing in P2C2 takes place while the BEVs are in-motion, which aims at minimizing travel time loss. To reduce BEV-to-BEV contact time without increasing manufacturing costs, we propose to use multiple batteries of varying sizes and charge transfer rates. The faster but smaller batteries are used for charge transfer between vehicles, while the slower but larger ones are used for prolonged charge storage. We have designed the overall P2C2 framework and formalized the decision-making process of the cloud-based control system. We have evaluated the effectiveness of P2C2 using a well-characterized simulation platform and observed dramatic improvement in BEV mobility. Additionally, through statistical analysis, we show that a significant reduction in carbon emission is also possible if MoCS can be powered by renewable energy sources.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08942-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Smart vehicles understand the environment through multi-sensor, network, and pervasive systems for gaining useful information. The problem arises with the absence of useful information in explicit scenarios where heterogeneous information becomes mandatory. This article aims to improve transportation support's effectiveness using a discrete behavior information fusion (DBIF) based on the deep learning technique by considering the contradiction in information availability. This proposed technique observes the vehicles' behavior and response to the scene throughout the route displacement. The deep learning model achieves greater accuracy in target detection and classification. The learning output is the independent fusion of behavior (response output) and information (sensed). This sensed information is useful in categorizing further deviations and stipulations for the progressive displacements. The stipulated information and its deviations are recurrently categorized using support vector machine learning. The information provides accurate positioning and tracking of smart vehicles by reducing approximation errors and complexity. The simulation results illustrate the proposed technique's efficiency by improving the accuracy of 92.078% and fusion rate of 0.9741 and reducing error of 0.0662, complexity of 0.0717, and fusion time of 0.9938 compared to existing methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-04115-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many deep learning-based algorithms using two-dimensional images have become an essential tool for autonomous vehicles with object detection, tracking, and segmentation for road target detection, primarily including pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on visual data to classify and generalize target objects which can satisfy pedestrians’ and other vehicles’ safety requirements in their environment. In real-time, outstanding results are obtained by deep learning-based algorithms for object detection. While several studies have thoroughly examined different types of deep learning-based object detection methods, there are a few comparable studies that either test the detection speed or accuracy of the object detection algorithms. In addition to speed and accuracy, autonomous driving also depends on model size and energy efficiency. However, there is a lack of comparison on various such metrics among existing deep learning-based methods. This article aims to provide a detailed and systematic comparative analysis of five independent mainstream deep learning-based algorithms for road object detection, namely the R-FCN, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, and YOLOv4 on a large-scale Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD100K) dataset. The experimental results are analyzed using the mean Average Precision (mAP) value and inference time. Additionally, various practical metrics, such as model size, computational complexity, and energy efficiency of deep learning-based models are precisely computed. Furthermore, the performance of each algorithm is evaluated under different road environmental conditions at various times of day and night.

The results illustrate that both cost efficiencies and new revenue streams can be realised, as the insurance business model will shift from loss compensation to loss prediction and prevention.

The first is that the application of artificial intelligence by insurance companies might allow for a more accurate prediction of loss probabilities, thus reducing one of the industry’s most inherent problems, namely asymmetric information. The second development is that artificial intelligence might change the risk landscape significantly by transforming some risks from low-severity/high-frequency to high-severity/low-frequency.

Article,doi:10.1007/s00607-022-01078-1,Trust-driven reinforcement selection strategy for federated learning on IoT devices,Computing,10.1007/s00607-022-01078-1,Springer,2022-04-01,"Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach that enables a large number of edge/end devices to perform on-device training for a single machine learning model, without having to share their own raw data. We consider in this paper a federated learning scenario wherein the local training is carried out on IoT devices and the global aggregation is done at the level of an edge server. One essential challenge in this emerging approach is IoT devices selection (also called scheduling), i.e., how to select the IoT devices to participate in the distributed training process. The existing approaches suggest to base the scheduling decision on the resource characteristics of the devices to guarantee that the selected devices would have enough resources to carry out the training. In this work, we argue that trust should be an integral part of the decision-making process and therefore design a trust establishment mechanism between the edge server and IoT devices. The trust mechanism aims to detect those IoT devices that over-utilize or under-utilize their resources during the local training. Thereafter, we introduce DDQN-Trust, a double deep Q learning-based selection algorithm that takes into account the trust scores and energy levels of the IoT devices to make appropriate scheduling decisions. Finally, we integrate our solution into four federated learning aggregation approaches, namely, FedAvg , FedProx , FedShare and FedSGD . Experiments conducted using a real-world dataset show that our DDQN-Trust solution always achieves better performance compared to two main benchmarks: the DQN and random scheduling algorithms. The results also reveal that FedProx outperforms the competitor aggregation models in terms of accuracy when integrated into our DDQN-Trust solution.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00607-022-01078-1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The tools used by attackers are becoming more and more automated and sophisticated, and malicious machine learning agents seem to be the next development in this line. In order to provide ethical hackers with similar tools, and to understand the impact and the limitations of artificial agents, we present in this paper a model that formalizes web hacking tasks for reinforcement learning agents. Our model, named Agent Web Model , considers web hacking as a capture-the-flag style challenge, and it defines reinforcement learning problems at seven different levels of abstraction. We discuss the complexity of these problems in terms of actions and states an agent has to deal with, and we show that such a model allows to represent most of the relevant web vulnerabilities. Aware that the driver of advances in reinforcement learning is the availability of standardized challenges, we provide an implementation for the first three abstraction layers, in the hope that the community would consider these challenges in order to develop intelligent web hacking agents.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10207-021-00554-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

During the last decade, a significant effort has been made by researchers to model and predict the exact time a driver starts a lane changing maneuver and to investigate the factors that may affect the above decision. However, lane changing at intersections remains an under-researched area due to the complexity of the maneuvers and the need for very detailed trajectory data. In this paper, a methodology for modeling the likelihood of lane changing at intersections is proposed based on a comprehensive feature extraction mechanism, which attempts to quantify the favorability of the surrounding environment towards lane changing and simple LSTM modeling structures. The models are trained on data coming from a highly congested intersection in the city of Athens (Greece). Findings indicate that the proposed lane changing model trained to predict the occurrence of a lane changing maneuver within 1 and 5 s ahead, achieves an accuracy of about 96% for both applications (single step and multiple step prediction). These results show strong evidence that, regardless of the complexity of the problem at hand, simple predictive deep learning architectures enhanced with meaningful spatio-temporal representation and related features can achieve a high level of performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42421-022-00055-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
Article,doi:10.1007/s11517-021-02497-6,A real use case of semi-supervised learning for mammogram classification in a local clinic of Costa Rica,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,10.1007/s11517-021-02497-6,Springer,2022-04-01,"The implementation of deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems for the classification of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy, reliability, and cost of diagnosing patients. However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labelled images, which can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners are required. To address this, a number of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics, which can be used to pre-train the model. However, using models trained on these datasets for later transfer learning and model fine-tuning with images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets, which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. In this work, a real-world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. A common approach to further improve the model’s performance under such small labelled target dataset setting is data augmentation. However, often cheaper unlabelled data is available from the target clinic. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning, which leverages both labelled and unlabelled data, can be used in such conditions. In this work, we evaluate the semi-supervised deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to take advantage of unlabelled data from the target dataset, for whole mammogram image classification. We compare the usage of semi-supervised learning on its own, and combined with transfer learning (from a source mammogram dataset) with data augmentation, as also against regular supervised learning with transfer learning and data augmentation from source datasets. It is shown that the use of a semi-supervised deep learning combined with transfer learning and data augmentation can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labelled observations. Also, we found a strong influence of the source dataset, which suggests a more data-centric approach needed to tackle the challenge of scarcely labelled data. We used several different metrics to assess the performance gain of using semi-supervised learning, when dealing with very imbalanced test datasets (such as the G-mean and the F2-score), as mammogram datasets are often very imbalanced. Graphical Abstract Description of the test-bed implemented in this work. Two different source data distributions were used to fine-tune the different models tested in this work.

In contrast with the most existing work that deals with demand uncertainty using predefined probability distributions, the learning-based framework is capable of handling demand uncertainty by learning the intrinsic pattern from large-scale historical data and computing high quality solutions. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct a group of numerical experiments based on New York taxicab trip record data set. The experimental results show that our proposed data-driven approach outperforms the parametric approaches and deterministic model in terms of business profit, relocation rate, and value of stochastic solution (VSS). Most significantly, compared with the deterministic approach, the vehicle relocation rates are reduced by approximate 80%, 70% and 40% under small fleet size, medium fleet size and large fleet size, respectively. In addition, the VSS of our approach is more than 3 times higher than the one of Poisson distribution by average.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13177-021-00269-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

ADAS involves several advanced approaches such as automotive electronics, vehicular communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and its associated aspects such as machine learning and deep learning. Of these, computer vision and machine learning-based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver-aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with ADAS deployment and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. These solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/ chaotic traffic. Hence, critical ADAS functionalities and even L2/ L3 autonomy levels in driving remain a major open challenge. In this regard, this work proposes a novel framework called Auto-Alert. Auto-Alert performs a two-stage spatial and temporal analysis based on external traffic environment and tri-axial sensor system for safe driving assistance. This work investigates time-series analysis with deep learning models for driving events prediction and assistance. Further, as a basic premise, various essential design considerations towards the ADAS are discussed. Significantly, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models are applied in the proposed Auto-Alert. It is shown that the LSTM outperforms the CNN with 99% for the considered window length. Importantly, this also involves developing and demonstrating an efficient traffic monitoring and density estimation system. Further, this work provides the benchmark results for Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), specifically for the object detection task. The findings of this proposed work demonstrate the significance of using CNN and LSTM networks to assist the driver in the holistic traffic environment.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13177-021-00272-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Autonomous driving solutions are well established for urban rail transportation systems. Many metro lines in service worldwide have reached the highest grade of automation where the train is automatically operated without any staff on board. However, autonomous driving is still an open challenge for mainline trains, due to the complexity of the mainline environment. In this context, automated recognition of wayside signals can help to minimise the risk of human error owing to low visibility and fatigue. It represents a key step towards the fully autonomous train. In this article we present a deep learning based approach for the above task. The You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) is used for detection and recognition of wayside signals. A heuristic is used to recognise blinking states. We consider FRSign dataset, a large collection of over 100,000 images of traffic signals from some of the trains in French Railways. A distilled and cleaned version of the dataset curated by us is used for training. The trained network has low computational overhead and can recognise traffic signals in real time and under diverse field conditions. It has robust performance even for complex scenes having multiple signals and light sources, and in adverse circumstances such as rain and night environments.

Traditional ML and DL approaches that operate with data stored on a centralized server raise major privacy problems for user data. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of a smart sensing network demands lightweight security solutions. To address these issues, this article proposes a Federated Learning (FL)-based attack detection framework for VSN. The proposed scheme utilizes a group of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with a Random Forest (RF)-based ensembler unit. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is investigated through multiple performance metrics. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed FL approach successfully detected the cyberattacks in VSN with the highest accuracy of 99.52%.

Human activity recognition now offers a solution for fall detection systems that assist older people at home. A fall detection system that responds promptly to fatal falls can help to reduce the fall severity. Fall detection systems are developed using wearable environmental sensors and video data. Wearable devices are not always feasible as they cause inconvenience to the user. Hence, our paper presents a new promising solution for fall detection using vision-based approaches. In this approach, we analyse the human joint points which are the prime motion indicators. A set of key points of the subject are acquired by applying the AlphaPose pre-trained network. These keypoints are inferred to be the joint points of the subject. The acquired keypoints are processed through a framework of convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. Here, the spatial correlation of the keypoints is analysed. The long-term dependencies are then preserved with the help of long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. Our system detects five types of falls and six types of daily living activities. We used the UP-FALL detection dataset for validating our fall detection system and achieved commendable results when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

For artificial systems to successfully act and adapt in the real world, it is desirable to similarly be able to learn on a continual basis. This challenge is known as lifelong learning, and remains to a large extent unsolved. In this Perspective article, we identify a set of key capabilities that artificial systems will need to achieve lifelong learning. We describe a number of biological mechanisms, both neuronal and non-neuronal, that help explain how organisms solve these challenges, and present examples of biologically inspired models and biologically plausible mechanisms that have been applied to artificial systems in the quest towards development of lifelong learning machines. We discuss opportunities to further our understanding and advance the state of the art in lifelong learning, aiming to bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence. It is an outstanding challenge to develop intelligent machines that can learn continually from interactions with their environment, throughout their lifetime.

The usage of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is one possible solution for preventing attacks in VANET.

This paper, therefore, proposes a new machine learning model to improve the performance of IDSs by using Random Forest and a posterior detection based on coresets to improve the detection accuracy and increase detection efficiency.

How human values are embodied and actualised in situ may ultimately prove to be harmful if not outright recalcitrant. For this reason, the values of stakeholders become of particular significance given the risks posed by opaque structures of intelligent agents. This paper explores how decision matrix algorithms, via the belief-desire-intention model for autonomous vehicles, can be designed to minimize the risks of opaque architectures. Primarily through an explicit orientation towards designing for the values of explainability and verifiability. In doing so, this research adopts the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as a principled framework for the incorporation of such values within design. VSD is recognized as a potential starting point that offers a systematic way for engineering teams to formally incorporate existing technical solutions within ethical design, while simultaneously remaining pliable to emerging issues and needs. It is concluded that the VSD methodology offers at least a strong enough foundation from which designers can begin to anticipate design needs and formulate salient design flows that can be adapted to the changing ethical landscapes required for utilisation in autonomous vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-021-00790-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The interaction effect of brand personality and service provision type on brand attitudes and purchase intentions,Journal of Brand Management,10.1057/s41262-021-00261-7,Springer,2022-03-01,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technology has advanced, it has become crucial to promoting service innovation and evolution. However, whether and when consumers prefer AI-enabled services remains unclear. This study addresses this question by investigating the matching effect of brand personality (sincerity vs. competence) and customer service provision type (human-staffed vs. AI-enabled) on brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Three scenario-based online experiments revealed that consumers prefer AI-enabled customer service when the brand personality is competence and human-staffed service when the brand personality is sincerity. These preferences lead to more positive brand attitudes and higher purchase intentions. We also found that perceived brand authenticity mediates the above relationships. Meanwhile, our investigation of the moderating role of consumer involvement found that the brand personality-service provision alignment’s positive effects emerge for high-involvement consumers but not for low-involvement consumers. These findings contribute to brand personality and authenticity theory and have practical implications for companies’ marketing strategies—elucidating, for example, how the effects of utilizing AI-enabled customer service may influence brand attitudes and purchase intentions regarding brands with different “personalities.”",http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41262-021-00261-7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At the same time, a conventional data storage and management layer is not optimized to derive timely insights and value from huge volumes of data. This problem is rooted in a classical cross-layer dilemma wherein neither the application nor the storage layer has the deep knowledge needed to optimize the whole system. We resolve this omniscience dilemma by introducing ProSPECT, a set of techniques to proactively optimize analytics computations and data storage. ProSPECT enables a data fabric to become aware of the purpose and relevance of stored data by intercepting the lineage of workflows under execution within existing analytics frameworks. Partial analytics computations can then be initiated proactively by the data fabric layer, where data is stored and managed. ProSPECT provides analytics applications with relevant data or precomputed insights and alleviates storage management challenges using proactive tiering and data approximation. We describe experiments with application case studies using Apache Spark and Alluxio to demonstrate an order of magnitude reduction in the storage space occupied in the fastest tier and in time to value for analytics applications.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41403-021-00261-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we explore textual descriptions of more than 250 thousand startups in the Crunchbase database. We analyze the 2009–2019 period by using topic modeling. We propose a novel classification of startup companies free from expert bias that contains 38 topics and quantifies the weight of each of these topics for all the startups. Taking the year of establishment and geographical location of the startups into account, we measure which topics were increasing or decreasing their share over time, and which of them were predominantly present in Europe, North America, or other regions. We find that the share of startups focused on data analytics, social platforms, and financial transfers, and time management has risen, while an opposite trend is observed for mobile gaming, online news, and online social networks as well as legal and professional services. We also identify strong regional differences in topic distribution, suggesting certain concentration of the startups. For example, sustainable agriculture is presented stronger in South America and Africa, while pharmaceutics, in North America and Europe. Furthermore, we explore which pairs of topics tend to co-occur more often together, quantify how multisectoral the startups are, and which startup classes attract more investments. Finally, we compare our classification to the one existing in the Crunchbase database, demonstrating how we improve it. We propose a novel classification of more than 250 thousand startups registered in the Crunchbase database based on machine learning algorithms and free from expert bias.

But with this comes an extensive risk of unauthorized access. Hence, for the security and privacy of the data, intrusion detection system (IDS) is required. IDS has to process a huge number of data with dimensions in search of intrusions. The more data it has to scan through, the more time it takes to detect an intrusion. Thus to reduce the dataset, feature selection (FS) is used where redundant data dimensions are discarded. In this paper, authors have proposed a novel Sage Grouse Mating algorithm which is to be implemented for FS in IDS. The proposed model was tested on NSL-KDD and Kyoto2006+ datasets. The proposed model increases the average accuracy of IDS up to 81.729% and reduces the number of features from 41 to 14 on NSL-KDD dataset.

In autonomous vehicles, the driving scene (target domain) consists of unconstrained road environments which cannot all possibly be observed in training data (source domain) and this will lead to a sharp drop in the accuracy of the detector. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework based on pseudo-labels to solve the domain shift. First, the pseudo-labels of the target domain images are generated by the baseline detector (BD) and optimized by our data optimization module to correct the errors. Then, the hard samples in a single image are labeled based on the optimization results of pseudo-labels. The adaptive sampling module is approached to sample target domain data according to the number of hard samples per image to select more effective data. Finally, a modified knowledge distillation loss is applied in the retraining module, and we investigate two ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain to retrain the detector. We evaluate the average precision of our approach in various source/target domain pairs and demonstrate that the framework improves over 10% average precision of BD on multiple domain adaptation scenarios on the Cityscapes, KITTI, and Apollo datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06609-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, this scheme requires an inquiry-answer process, which quadratically increases the computational load as the number of agents increases. To enhance the scalability of TL for MARL when all the agents learn from scratch, we propose an experience sharing based memetic TL for MARL, called MeTL-ES. In the MeTL-ES, the agents actively share implicit memetic knowledge (experience), which avoids the inquiry-answer process and brings highly scalable and effective acceleration of learning. In particular, we firstly design an experience sharing scheme to share implicit meme based experience among the agents. Within this scheme, experience from the peers is collected and used to speed up the learning process. More importantly, this scheme frees the agents from actively asking for the states and policies of other agents, which enhances scalability. Secondly, an event-triggered scheme is designed to enable the agents to share the experiences at appropriate timings. Simulation studies show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed MeTL-ES can more effectively enhance the learning speed of learning-from-scratch MARL systems. At the same time, we show that the communication cost and computational load of MeTL-ES increase linearly with the growth of the number of agents, indicating better scalability compared to the popular action advising based methods.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12293-021-00339-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

According to the digital transformation trends, Internet of Things (IoT) represents an interested research issue. As the IoT grows, the data and the processes will need more space. The data in cases like healthcare, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart agriculture, etc. needs to be analyzed and processed in real-time. Cisco refers to the dependence of edge and cloud as “The Fog”. The data can be analyzed at the fog layer to maximize data utilization. This paper presents a new Effective Prediction and Resource Allocation Methodology (EPRAM) for Fog environment, which is suitable for Healthcare applications. Resource Allocation (RA) represents a hard mission as it involves a set of various resources and fog nodes to achieve the required computations for IoT systems. EPRAM tries to achieve effective resource management in Fog environment via real-time resource allocating as well as prediction algorithm. EPRAM is composed of three main modules, namely: (i) Data Preprocessing Module (DPM), (ii) Resource Allocation Module (RAM) and (ii) Effective Prediction Module (EPM). The EPM uses the PNN to predict a target field, using one or more predictors. In order to detect the probability of the heart attack, PNN is trained using the training dataset. Then PNN will be tested using the user’s sensing data coming from the IoT layer to predict the probability of heart attack and then take the most appropriate action accordingly. The main goal of the system is to achieve a low latency while improving the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as (the allocation cost, the response time, bandwidth efficiency and energy consumption). Unlike other RA techniques, EPRAM employs deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in a new manner. It also uses the PNN for the prediction algorithm. It has achieved such acceptable performance due to using deep RL and PNN. Deep RL has shown impressive promises in resource allocation. PNN generates accurate predicted target and is much faster than multilayer perceptron networks. Comparing the EPRAM with the state-of-the-art algorithms, EPRAM achieved the minimum Makespan as compared to previous LB algorithms, while maximizing the Average Resource Utilization (ARU) and the Load Balancing Level (LBL). Accordingly, EPRAM is a suitable algorithm in the case of real-time systems in FC which leads to load balancing. ERAM is effective in monitoring and predicting the status of the patient accurately and quickly.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-022-12223-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Lane detection algorithm is crucial aspect in making intelligent driving systems that can be used in autonomous self-driving vehicles, road safety, and accidents prevention systems, testing and analyzing driving skills, etc. Lane detection systems using hand crafted features fails in complex scenarios like adverse weather condition, low illumination, sharp turns and occlusion. Recently, deep learning models have been used remarkable in driving assistance systems and shows a significant improvement in their performance. Although, deep learning based methods has shown significant success in lane detection using hybrid techniques, that includes FCN, CNN and RNN.

We define three metrics: two matrics based on RSSI and Intertial Measurement Unit (IMU) readings and one joint metric. This way the filtering is based on both, the external information (RSSI) and the internal information (IMU). To process the IMU data, we use machine learning activity recognition models (we apply feature selection and compare three models and choose the best one—Gradient Boosted Decision Trees).

Unintended accidents will always take place, but the ones caused by malicious attacks represent a very challenging issue. This includes maliciously hijacking and controlling robots and causing serious economic and financial losses. This paper reviews the main security vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and their impacts, and the main security attacks within the robotics domain.

Considered as a promising way to handle the ever-growing complexity of software systems, they have seen an increasing level of interest and are covering a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous car systems and adaptive network systems. Many approaches for the construction of self-adaptive systems have been developed, and probabilistic models, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs), are one of the favoured. However, the majority of them do not deal with the problems of the underlying MDP being obsolete under new environments or unsatisfactory to the given properties. This results in the generated policies from such MDP failing to guide the self-adaptive system to run correctly and meet goals. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to updating an obsolete MDP by exploring new states and transitions and removing obsolete ones, and repairing an unsatisfactory MDP by adjusting its structure in a more meaningful way rather than arbitrarily changing the transition probabilities to values not in line with reality. Experimental results show that the MDPs updated and repaired by our approach are more competent in guiding the self-adaptive systems’ correct running compared with the original ones.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-021-1484-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

An ethical controller is proposed to be embedded into these autonomous systems, to enable their successful integration in the society and its norms. This proposed controller that integrates machine ethics is realized through three main strategies that utilize two ethical paradigms, namely deontology, and consequentialism. These strategies are triggered according to the type of event sensed and the state of the autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems, their combination being potentially unknown or posing ethical dilemmas. Two case studies are investigated, that deal with a fire emergency, and two different contexts i.e. one with an autonomous train, and one with an autonomous industrial plant, are discussed to illustrate the controller utilization. The case studies demonstrate the potential benefits and exemplify the need to integrate ethical behaviors in autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems already at the design phase.

Existing ML defense techniques have several limitations in practical use. We proposed a trustworthy framework that employs an adaptive strategy to inspect both inputs and decisions.

Experimental results (using benchmark data-sets) demonstrated that our dual-filtering strategy could mitigate adaptive or advanced adversarial manipulations for wide-range of ML attacks with higher accuracy. Moreover, the output decision boundary inspection with a classification technique automatically affirms the reliability and increases the trustworthiness of any ML-based decision support system.

Using a scientometrics analysis of the publication records (between 1991 and 2020; n  = 1028), and content analysis of highly cited publications, our study provided insights on the ELSE implications of AI. Our study findings indicate that ELSE implications of AI development started gaining momentum globally over the last 5 years and we predict that by the end of this decade publication numbers will be more than 750 per year. Europe (46%) and North America (33%) were leaders in publications in this area while Africa (1.8%) and South America (1.4%) have lagged behind. Additionally, the computer science (350) research area had the maximum number of ELSE implications of AI publications, followed by humanities and social sciences (e.g., legal, policy; 322), but have not been explored extensively in the agricultural sciences (23). We observed that the major disparities in studies of ELSE implications of AI were found to be a combination of economics, governance, sociocultural, and policy factors.

Each member of the collective of autonomous vehicles tries to adapt to the changing environment, therefore together they execute decentralised autonomous adaptation by exploiting real-time information about their environment. The routing of these vehicles needs proper computer science models to be able to develop the best information technology for their control. We review different traffic flow models in computer science, and we evaluate their usefulness and applicability to autonomous vehicles. The classical game theory model implies flow level decision making in route selection. Non-cooperative autonomous vehicles may produce unwanted traffic patterns. Improved decentralised autonomous adaptation techniques try to establish some kind of coordination among autonomous vehicles, mainly through intention awareness. The aggregation of the intentions of autonomous vehicles may help to predict future traffic situations. The novel intention-aware online routing game model points out that intention-awareness helps to avoid that the traffic generated by autonomous vehicles be worse than the traffic indicated by classical traffic flow models. The review helps to make the first steps towards research on global level control of autonomous vehicles by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different formal models.

Focusing on the main system, real-time retrieval of outputs based on mutual interactions of the whole autonomous entities makes the agent-based simulation very promising. This paper deals with an agent-based simulation to investigate and evaluate the potential impacts of implementing Shared Public Transports (SPT) in urban areas. Such a system is intended to integrate the two flows of passengers and containerized freights in Public Transportation (PT) patterns towards more sustainable, efficient, and socially suitable mobility. The proposed model is coupled with a stochastic process in order to provide a range of real-world data of Casablanca city (Morocco) based on institutional surveys. In this respect, two urban transportation systems of freight are tested: (1) the conventional transportation system, (2) the SPT system with heterogeneous fleets. In an effort to sustain efficient and safe movements, this paper examines SPT performances according to a set of key evaluation metrics. Results show that PT stopping remains the most relevant factor when evaluating metrics of the number of waiting containers and waiting time of demand by rates of 82.440% and 62.580%, respectively. Such a waiting containers metric is significantly affected by the volume of demand to transport per time slot by a rate of 78.140%. Under SPT, traffic congestion is the main factor to consider in managing PT with a rate of 65.690% in order to reduce potential accidents. However, demand volume could increase the on-street illegal parking metric by 90.070%.

These shortcomings are diverse and range from a lack of generalization over insufficient interpretability and implausible predictions to directed attacks by means of malicious inputs. Cyber-physical systems employing DNNs are therefore likely to suffer from so-called safety concerns, properties that preclude their deployment as no argument or experimental setup can help to assess the remaining risk. In recent years, an abundance of state-of-the-art techniques aiming to address these safety concerns has emerged. This chapter provides a structured and broad overview of them.

However, in OECD-Europe, transportation still represents the biggest source of carbon emissions, contributing by about 25% to the total CO 2 emissions, with cars and vans representing more than two-thirds of this share. The situation is even more alarming in non-OECD countries, where the transportation energy demand is expected to rise by 64% until 2040. The shift that we are witnessing toward the adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is going to be perhaps the most disruptive since the early days of automobiles and could revolutionize movement of people and goods. This level of connectivity and autonomy will transform transportation in several dimensions with important societal and economic impacts: improved safety, increased comfort, time saving potential, and more efficient road utilization are among the most widely discussed positive impacts of CAVs. However, the potential energy efficiency benefits of these technologies remain uncertain. From a single-vehicle efficiency perspective, research suggests that lightweight, low-speed, autonomous vehicles have the potential to achieve fuel economy an order of magnitude higher than current cars. Yet, at system-wide level, current estimates suggest that the total energy consumption impacts can range from a 90% decrease to a 200% increase in fuel consumption as compared to a projected 2050 baseline energy consumption. The paradigm that traffic congestion mitigation should reduce CO 2 emissions is yet to be proved. Therefore, interest in transportation regulation problems with explicit environmental considerations is growing. This work takes a more in-depth look at increased opportunities for energy-efficient driving with energy-oriented traffic management and CAVs deployment. In particular, the focus will be put on the road traffic control strategies in urban networks using connectivity to enable variable speed limits and traffic light adaptive control, as well as the energy-saving opportunities that arise for individual CAVs by anticipating future road geometry, traffic conditions, and interactions with neighboring vehicles.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72579-2_128,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is an unprecedented increase in machine learning and deep learning applications, especially with the emergence of fast mobile devices with access to cloud computing. While cloud computing provides the necessary computational power to train deep learning models, trained models can be easily deployed in the cloud or on embedded devices at the edge of the cloud to carry out the inference.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-03758-0_6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The team TUM Autonomous Motorsports will participate in the Indy Autonomous Challenge in October 2021 to benchmark its self-driving software-stack by racing one out of ten autonomous Dallara AV-21 racecars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The first part of this paper explains the reasons for entering an autonomous vehicle race from an academic perspective: It allows focusing on several edge cases encountered by autonomous vehicles, such as challenging evasion maneuvers and unstructured scenarios. At the same time, it is inherently safe due to the motorsport related track safety precautions. It is therefore an ideal testing ground for the development of autonomous driving algorithms capable of mastering the most challenging and rare situations. In addition, we provide insight into our software development workflow and present our Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation setup. It is capable of running simulations of up to eight autonomous vehicles in real time.

Depending on this issue, the scenarios research that can ensure safety and are related to vehicle safety assessments are essential. In this paper, based on ‘report of traffic collision involving an AVs’ provided by California DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), we extract the major factors for identifying AVs traffic accidents to derive basic AVs traffic accident scenarios by employing the random forest, one of the machine learning. As a result, we have found the importance of the pre-collision movement of neighboring vehicles to AVs and inferred that they are related to collision time (TTC). Based on these factors, we derived scenarios and confirm that AVs rear-end collisions of neighboring vehicles usually occur when AVs are ahead in passing, changing lanes, and merge situations. While most accident determinants and scenarios are expected to be similar to those between human driving vehicles (HVs), AVs are expected to reduce accident rates because ‘AVs do not cause accidents.’",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9416-5_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Technological integration and digital transformation are of focus in the strategy to recover and reconstruct civic society post-pandemic across the globe, especially in the domains of healthcare, education, surveillance, and governance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen to benefit society through building and assisting critical socio-technical systems. Automated decision-making through algorithms is debated widely for its limitations in tackling biases and inability to discourage unintended. Moreover, AI learns patterns from the data, which by nature is biased due to existing socio-economic complexities. The pervasive application of AI when implemented and integrated with social systems is observed to pose socio-ethical challenges such as institutionalization of discrimination, biased decision-making, intrusiveness, low accountability, and mistrust. Various threats and vulnerabilities imposed to human community-like natural disasters, health pandemics, and economic uncertainties necessitate inevitable adoption of AI applications that can mitigate socio-ethical challenges and adhere to human security principles. Current data protection laws seem to be insufficient to protect human rights in the given scenarios. Literature advocates for transparency, explainability, and auditability of AI models. However, it may not necessarily lead to accountability and fairness. Embedding these socio-technical systems in the broader institutional frameworks of regulation and governance can balance the risks without compromising on the benefits of technological innovations. The socio-economic context in which AI model is deployed necessitates the responses to be local and context specific. This also necessitates AI governance framework to be comprehensive, prevention-oriented, while protecting and empowering human value and dignity. This chapter provides commentary on the social, ethical, and technical issues that AI can impose along with various aspects that need to be considered while governing AI. Finally, an AI governance framework is proposed based on socio-administrative principles to extend their credibility in mitigating, managing and governing the human threats and uphold human security.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-5074-1_22,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As indicated by Gartner’s recent study, there are around 25 billion devices and a gadget interfacing with IoT including wearables and automated vehicles to smart homes and smart cities applications. All such connected (smart) devices generate immense data that needs to be examined and analysed, to ensure that they continually learn from the available datasets and better themselves without any manual interference. This is where the prerequisite for machine learning comes into being. Several ML algorithms and techniques are introduced in a short time to easily evaluate big data measurements, increasing the IoT’s productivity. Similarly, special ML techniques, such as decision trees, clustering and neural and Bayesian networks, allow devices and gadgets to discern trends from various sources in different kinds of datasets and take appropriate decisions based on their analysis. It would really be difficult for smart devices to make smart decisions gradually without including and enforcing ML. The IoT helps to interconnect various hardware devices, such as houses, cars, electronic gadgets and other devices that are integrated with actuators, sensors and software, so that data can be collected and shared. As various organizations understand the progressive capability of the IoT, they have begun finding various obstructions they have to deliver to use it productively. Numerous organizations and businesses use ML to exploit the IoT’s latent capacity. This chapter evaluates the different methods of machine learning that deal with the challenges posed in the handling of IoT data. Note that this big data is generated through the communication of Internet of Things/smart devices, and this data stored at cloud.

The Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) technology refers to a combination of cognitive systems and IoT. A benefit of this technology is that the management problems of the IoT will be solved by solutions that come from cognitive systems domain. In recent years, CIoT has received much attention. This is because the management algorithms of the IoT are very complex and therefore human thinking processes as computerized cognitive processes are required for fast and accurate decision-making. Existing algorithms reported as management mechanisms for CIoT only focus on utilizing artificial intelligence without considering fundamental issues of cognitive systems such as predictability, controllability, responsibility, safety, security, and energy consumption. Ignoring these issues may result in designing inappropriate cognitive systems that may be faced with a wide range of problems such as hacking and failure. CIoT inherited numerous challenges from artificial intelligence, IoT, and cognitive systems. Therefore, the challenges of these fields should be studied to extract the challenges in designing CIoT. In the literature, there is no study on extracting the challenges considering associated technologies to CIoT. In this paper, the challenges of the associated technologies are summarized.

It can be determined by different parameters such as temperature/humidity, soil mineral contents, soil pH level, salinity level, climatic conditions, moisture of the soil, etc. These parameters must meet the optimum level to make a desirable environment to sustain productivity. Failure to provide the required condition from any of the parameters will lead the plant to stress and deteriorate, potentially leading to a loss in productivity. Laborious ways of monitoring the agricultural parameters are inefficient and time-consuming. An automated irrigation system is essential for the proper growth of crops. Excessive watering of crops and crop water dehydration can lead to stresses that affect the growth of plants. Supplying an optimum amount of water is essential for the healthy development of plants. The IoT and artificial intelligence technologies are the most viable alternative solution for traditional yield prediction and irrigation because of the remote accessibility, interoperability, cognitive capability, etc. These technologies aid the farmers in monitoring agricultural parameters remotely from embedded devices, drastically reducing human efforts.

With the increasing use of deep learning techniques in robotics, a large number of robot manufacturing companies have started adopting deep learning techniques to improve the monitoring performance of autonomous robots. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a widely used middleware platform for building autonomous robot applications. However, the deployment of deep learning models to autonomous robots using ROS remains an unexplored area of research. Most recent research has focused on using deep learning techniques to solve specific problems (e.g., shopping assistant robots, autopilot systems, automatic annotation of 3D maps for safe flight). However, integrating the data collection hardware (e.g., sensors) and deep learning models within ROS is difficult and expensive in terms of computational power, time, and energy (battery). To address these challenges, we have developed EasyDLROS, a novel framework for robust deployment of pre-trained deep learning models on robots.

In order to proper object detection, the single forward propagation convolutional neural networks (YOLO) algorithm is performed. Based on the definition of YOLO (You Only Look Once), prediction step in the whole scene and image is performed in a single algorithm run.

This is achieved by mimicking the human driving behaviour in the training mode on a track. A dataset is generated by the simulator based on the human driving behaviour in the training mode and a deep learning model is built using this dataset which is then used to drive the car autonomously on any unseen track. Initially the model performed well only on the already seen track and failed to perform well on new unseen tracks. The simulator track in which the car was trained with didn’t consist of any sharp turns or elevations or any other road barriers, but the real world tracks do contain them, so in order to overcome this problem image processing techniques like zooming, changing brightness, flipping images, panning were used and in order to avoid over-fitting problem more dataset was generated using data augmentation techniques.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are no longer distant, detached research efforts but have become part of our everyday objects and experiences which are contributing to shape our professional, social and personal environments cultivating the technology enabled collective intelligence. Through this chapter we aim to explore the structure of technologies and product categories that constitute the ever dynamic and thriving AI landscape and their impacts in technician engagement through enhanced collaborative competencies. Specifically, AI technologies contributed to shape trends related with NDE competencies such as: 1. An unsatisfied demand of highly specialized NDE technicians in specific niches that runs parallel with the irruption and democratization of NDE technologies contained in direct-to-consumer products. 2. An increased bi-directional permeability of NDE and Digital competencies in the workplace. 3. Aging workforces decline amidst increased inspection demand aging-out of skilled craft and challenge in backfilling with current generational mindsets. As we will explore in Chap. 9, NDE 4.0 will imply a profound re-orientation of training and certification efforts not only for NDE professionals but also for AI assistants with increasingly capable NDE competencies. It will also shape normalization efforts to guide an ordered and natural assimilation of those technologies. Additionally, we aim to provide valuable connections to supplementary resources that may contribute from NDE professionals around the world to the use of AI technologies to expand their pursuits for professional and personal development with increased confidence.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73206-6_24,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Despite this considerable effort, there is a lack of a systematic and fair analysis of the input representations by means of a careful experimental evaluation on the same framework. To this aim, this work proposes the first comprehensive, comparative analysis of the most common inputs that can be processed by a conditional imitation learning (CIL) approach. With more details, we considered the combinations of raw and processed data—namely RGB images, depth (D) images and semantic segmentation (S)—to be assessed as inputs of the well-established Conditional Imitation Learning with ResNet and Speed prediction (CILRS) architecture. We performed a benchmark analysis, endorsed by statistical tests, on the CARLA simulator to compare the considered configurations. The achieved results showed that RGB outperformed the other monomodal inputs, in terms of success rate on the most popular benchmark NoCrash. However, RGB did not generalize well when tested on different weather conditions; overall, the best multimodal configuration was a combination of the RGB image and semantic segmentation inputs (i.e., RGBS) compared to the others, especially in regular and dense traffic scenarios.

In Study 1, we found perceived injustice was the primary determinant of uncanniness and uncanniness had a negative effect on trust. Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings using two different scenarios of wrongful acts involving an artificial agent.

However, one of the significant issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems’ unexpected or seemingly unpredictable outputs.

As a result, edge clouds for many applications (e.g. agriculture, ecology, and smart city deployments) must operate in remote, unattended, and environmentally harsh settings, introducing new challenges. One key challenge is heat exposure, which can degrade the performance, reliability, and longevity of electronics. For edge clouds, these problems are exacerbated because they increasingly perform complex workloads, such as machine learning, to affect data-driven actuation and control of devices and systems in the environment. The goal of our work is to protect edge clouds from overheating. To enable this, we develop a heat-budget-based scheduling system, called Sparta, which leverages dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to adaptively control CPU temperature. Sparta takes machine learning applications, datasets, and a temperature threshold as input. It sets the initial frequency of the CPU based on historical data and then dynamically updates it, according to the applications’ execution profile and ambient temperature, to safeguard edge devices.

This chapter reviews the application of forensics using Artificial Intelligence in the field of Cloud computing, IoT, and Blockchain Technology. To fulfill the study’s goal, a systematic literature review (SLR) was done. By manually searching six (6) well-known databases, documents were extracted. Based on the study topic, thirty three (33) primary studies were eventually considered. The study also discovered that (1) highlights several well-known challenges and open-Issues in IoT forensics research, as it is dependent on other technologies and is crucial when considering an end-to-end IoT application as an integrated environment with cloud and other technologies. (2) There has been less research dedicated to the use of AI in the field of forensics.

Starting with the rights-enabling framework of the GDPR, we proceed to uncover technical and protective forms of explanations owed under contract, tort and banking law. Moreover, we discuss what the recent EU proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act means for explainable AI, and review the proposal’s strengths and limitations in this respect.

Such multiple-objective optimizations include robot travelling distance minimization, time minimization, turning minimization, etc. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm incorporated with a Generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) method is proposed for a robot to reach multiple waypoints with minimized total distance. Firstly, a GVD is used to form a Voronoi diagram in an obstacle populated environment to construct safety-conscious routes. Secondly, the sequence of multiple waypoints is created by the PSO algorithm to minimize the total travel cost. Thirdly, while the robot attempts to visit multiple waypoints, it traverses along the edges of the GVD to form a collision-free trajectory. The regional path locally from waypoints to nearest nodes or edges needs to be created to join the trajectory. A Node Selection Algorithm (NSA) is developed in this paper to implement such a protocol to build up regional path from waypoints to nearest nodes or edges on GVD. Finally, a histogram-based local reactive navigator is adopted for moving obstacle avoidance. Simulation and comparison studies validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-09726-3_7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The book deals with the intersection of law and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Law and AI interact in two different ways, which are both covered in this book: law can regulate AI and AI can be applied in legal practice Legal practice . AI is a new generation of technologies, mainly characterized by being self-learning Self-learning technologies and autonomous. This means that AI technologies can continuously improve without (much) human intervention and can make decisions that are not pre-programmed. Artificial Intelligence can mimic human intelligence Human intelligence , but not necessarily so. Similarly, when AI is implemented in physical technologies, such as robots Robots , it can mimic human beings (e.g., socially assistive robots Robots acting like nurses), but it can also look completely different if it has a more functional shape (e.g., like an industrial arm that picks boxes in a factory). AI without a physical component can sometimes be hardly visible to end users, but evident to those that created and manage the system. In all its different shapes and sizes, AI is rapidly and radically changing the world around us, which may call for regulation in different areas of law. Relevant areas in public law Public law include non-discrimination law Non-discrimination law , labour law Labour law , humanitarian law Humanitarian law , constitutional law Constitutional law , immigration law Immigration law , criminal law Criminal law and tax law Tax law . Relevant areas in private law Private law include liability law, intellectual property law, corporate law, competition law Competition law and consumer law Consumer law . At the same time, AI can be applied in legal practice Legal practice . In this book, the focus is mostly on legal technologies, such as the use of AI in legal teams, law-making, and legal scholarship. This introductory chapter concludes with an overview of the structure of this book, containing introductory chapters on what AI is, chapters on how AI is (or could be) regulated in different areas of both public and private law Private law , chapters on applying AI in legal practice Legal practice , and chapters on the future of AI and what these developments may entail from a legal perspective.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-6265-523-2_1,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the importance of interpretable and explainable decision-making processes within AI-based systems is becoming crucial to provide transparency and confidence among end-users from diverse backgrounds. Acceptance of these black-box models considerably depends on to which extent the users or technical personnel understand and trust the underlying mechanism. However, ML methods and models are getting more sophisticated and transparent progressively. Though the domain experts understand the mathematical principle, they still face difficulties expressing the mechanism for a wide audience. To address this issue, a recent research domain—Explainable AI (XAI), has emerged intending to generate the contextual explanatory model for practical deployment. In this chapter, we systematically review and examine the existing literature and contribution of XAI in different domains. The presented taxonomy contains our investigation on the necessity of explaining and contextualizing methods and models in the AI ecosystem.

In recent years, modern transportation networks have undergone a rapid transformation. This has resulted in a variety of automotive technology advances, including connected vehicles, hybrid vehicles, Hyperloop, self-driving cars and even flying cars, as well as major improvements in global transportation networks. Because of the open existence of smart transportation system as a wireless networking technology, it poses a number of security and privacy challenges. Information and communication technology has long aided transportation productivity and safety in advanced economies. These implementations, on the other hand, have tended to be high-cost, customized infrastructure systems. To address these challenges, a novel machine learning method developed for a transportation system is reused for making it more generic and smart for intelligent carriage. This type of transfer learning enables rapid progress on the task with enhanced results. In this work, together with domain adaptation, a novel weighted average approach is used to build models related to the smart transportation system.

To achieve this, a learnable architecture is designed end-to-end, which fuses the detection results from multiple sensor modalities initially and exploits continuous convolution subsequently to achieve the desired levels of accuracy. An adaptive algorithm for prediction in real-time is used to automatically increase weightage to prediction results from a particular sensor modality which aids in keeping accuracy invariant to scene changes. To prevent the bias, we are using a training strategy which provides attention to the specific type of sensor. This strategy is inspired by dropout.

Deep learning is essentially predicated on the notion that, with a sufficiently large training set, the statistical correlations captured by training will actually be causal [310]. However, in the absence of convergence theorems to support this, it remains a hypothesis. Indeed, insofar as there is evidence, it increasingly indicates to the contrary, since the application of enormous volumes of computational effort has still failed to deliver models with the generalization capability of an infant. There is accordingly increasing discussion about what further conceptual or practical insights might be required [57]. At the time of writing, the very definition of deep learning is in flux, with one Turing Award laureate defining it as “a way to try to make machines intelligent by allowing computers to learn from examples” and another as “differentiable programming”. We argue in the following that deep learning is highly unlikely to yield intelligence, at the very least while it equates intelligence with “solving a regression problem”.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08020-3_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to its generality and robustness, RL is applied in several disciplines such as game theory, control theory, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, robotics, and NLP. Despite these advances and successes, reinforcement learning faces many challenges for real-world adoption. Some of the major difficulties being, operator’s trust and ability of an agent to explain the actions taken in a human-understandable manner. Traditionally the AI systems are black-box models. With the advent of various legal regulations worldwide, notably the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [ 29 ], it has started becoming mandatory that the AI models be transparent, interpretable, and secure. If an RL agent can effectively and accurately explain the actions carried out by the RL system to the observers/operators, it will be a tangible step towards developing the ART (accountable, reliable and trustworthy) RL agent. This can effectively facilitate the adoption of RL systems in real-world domains. Various explainable AI (XAI) methods have been reported in the literature. However, there is a considerable lacuna in the availability of Explainable RL (XRL) methods. This paper introduces a novel RL algorithm agnostic approach of generating human-understandable explanations using the probabilistic graphical model. This method is based on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) [ 36 ]. It is algorithm agnostic in that it is not dependent on any specific RL method and can be integrated with any RL algorithm. We also introduce a PGM model, which is learned along with an agent’s training via classic methods and used for generating explanations at run time. Specific case studies are considered, and results are presented which demonstrate our approach. Our experiments show that the PGM-based approach is highly intuitive and a definitive step towards generating the human understandable explanations. It is a promising approach for discrete as well as continuous real-world systems employing RL.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-95502-1_28,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Therefore, IoT will benefit from adapting a zero-trust networking model which requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on a private network, regardless of whether they are located within or outside of the network perimeter. Implementing such model can, however, become challenging, as the access policies have to be updated dynamically in the context of constantly changing network environment. In this research project, we are aiming to implement a prototype of intelligent defense framework relying on advanced technologies that have recently emerged in the area of software-defined networking and network function virtualization.

Such increases in memory and computational demands make deep learning prohibitive for resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile devices. Recent efforts aim to reduce these overheads, while preserving model performance as much as possible, and include parameter reduction techniques, parameter quantization, and lossless compression techniques. In this chapter, we develop and describe a novel quantization paradigm for DNNs: Our method leverages concepts of explainable AI (XAI) and concepts of information theory: Instead of assigning weight values based on their distances to the quantization clusters, the assignment function additionally considers weight relevances obtained from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and the information content of the clusters (entropy optimization). The ultimate goal is to preserve the most relevant weights in quantization clusters of highest information content. Experimental results show that this novel Entropy-Constrained and XAI-adjusted Quantization (ECQ $$^{\text {x}}$$ x ) method generates ultra low-precision (2–5 bit) and simultaneously sparse neural networks while maintaining or even improving model performance. Due to reduced parameter precision and high number of zero-elements, the rendered networks are highly compressible in terms of file size, up to 103 $$\times $$ × compared to the full-precision unquantized DNN model.

We first introduce an attack vector that derives from the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model itself. DNN models are trained from gigantic data that may be poisoned by attackers. Different from the traditional poisoning attacks that interfere with the decision boundary, backdoor attacks create a “shortcut” in the model’s decision boundary. Such a “shortcut” can only be activated by a trigger known by the attacker itself, while it performs well on benign inputs without the trigger. We then show several mitigation techniques from the frontend to the backend of the machine learning pipeline. We finally provide avenues for future research. We hope to raise awareness about the severity of the current emerging backdoor attacks in DNNs and attempt to provide a timely solution to fight against them.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98795-4_13,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Typically, it is intractable to test an autonomous system for every scenario in its operating environment. The question of whether it is possible to design a single test for multiple requirements of the system motivates this work. First, we formally define three attributes of a test: a test specification that characterizes behaviors observed in a test execution, a test environment, and a test policy. Using the merge operator from contract-based design theory, we provide a formalism to construct a merged test specification from two unit test specifications. Temporal constraints on the merged test specification guarantee that non-trivial satisfaction of both unit test specifications is necessary for a successful merged test execution. We assume that the test environment remains the same across the unit tests and the merged test. Given a test specification and a test environment, we synthesize a test policy filter using a receding horizon approach, and use the test policy filter to guide a search procedure (e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search) to find a test policy that is guaranteed to satisfy the test specification. This search procedure finds a test policy that maximizes a pre-defined robustness metric for the test while the filter guarantees a test policy for satisfying the test specification. We prove that our algorithm is sound. Furthermore, the receding horizon approach to synthesizing the filter ensures that our algorithm is scalable. Finally, we show that merging unit tests is impactful for designing efficient test campaigns to achieve similar levels of coverage in fewer test executions. We illustrate our framework on two self-driving examples in a discrete-state setting.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06773-0_7,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Similarly, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is getting more popular with all the revolutions made in the technologies. Sensor Network Technology is used in industrial applications, smart homes and system. A massive amount of data can be obtained from these sensors which are linked to the human body. Recognition of Human Activities using these sensors, and wearable technologies has been actively studied. Behavior Recognition seeks to distinguish one or more people’s activities and goals through a collection of observations on the actions and environmental conditions of the person. Health surveillance, aged treatment, and plenty of other domains can be used to automatically understand the behavioral context. An existing dataset consisting of 10 subjects (5 females, 5 males) is being used in the paper, which incorporates both young and old volunteers between 19 and 60 years of old with weights ranging from 55 to 85 kg. The dataset reflects motion data collected when subjects are engaged in 11 separate (static and dynamic) smart home activities: computer usage (1 min), telephone conversation (1 min), vacuum cleaning (1 min), book reading (1 min), TV watching (1 min), ironing (1 min), walking (1 min), exercise (1 min), cooking (1 min), drinking (20 times), hair brushing (1 min) (20 times). Most of the activities are similar because of the multi sensor environment which makes it more difficult. Using three tri axial IMU (inertial measurement unit), Magnetometer, Accelerometer, Gyroscope sensors attached to the subject area of the hand, chest, and thigh, using Machine Learning we introduced a better model to prognosticate the human activity. We have applied various machine learning classification algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, Ensemble Extra Trees Classifier, Label Propagation and Label Spreading.

The digitalization of services has resulted in a compelling, major change in the sector, which is now referred to as Industry 4.0. One of the major changes embracing this industrial revolution is the development of robotics. Today, with the tasks becoming increasingly complex, robots are more trusted to perform the tasks with accuracy. They are rapidly substituting human skills in terms of speed, accuracy, and replaceability. Over the years, they have made vital contributions to some of the major industries, like 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, computer chip building, health and safety, agriculture, and so on. Robotics is a key Industry 4.0 technology that gives significant possibilities in the realm of production. However, with the introduction of Industry 4.0, it has become increasingly impossible for a corporation to remain relevant without incorporating some type of intelligent technology. Big data, which is generated by a wide range of sensors, necessitates complicated systems capable of distilling usable information and making intelligent judgments. This is where technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning may help. The major result of combining these technologies with modern robotics is the creation of intelligent factories that are very powerful, safe, and cost-effective. The current research discussed the function of deep learning in robots for bolstering Industry 4.0.

Except for the high traffic scenario, for both mid-traffic and low-traffic scenarios, the proposed scheme shows a considerable improvement in both average densities and maximum densities. In the mid-traffic scenario, the average speed shows an improvement of 3.85 km/h, while in the low-traffic scenario, the average mean speed shows an improvement of 7.96 km/h.

Their operations require reliable networking environments and location-based services in air-to-air links with co-operative drones, or air-to-ground links in concert with ground control stations. When equipped with high-resolution video cameras or sensors to gain environmental situation awareness through object detection/tracking, precise location predictions of individual or groups of drones at any instant possible is critical for continuous guidance. The location predictions then can be used in trajectory optimization for achieving efficient operations (i.e., through effective resource utilization in terms of energy or network bandwidth consumption) and safe operations (i.e., through avoidance of obstacles or sudden landing) within application missions. In this chapter, we explain a diverse set of techniques involved in drone location prediction, position and velocity estimation and trajectory optimization involving: (i) Kalman Filtering techniques, and (ii) Machine Learning models such as reinforcement learning and deep-reinforcement learning. These techniques facilitate the drones to follow intelligent paths and establish optimal trajectories while carrying out successful application missions under given resource and network constraints. We detail the techniques using three scenarios. The first scenario involves location prediction based intelligent packet transfer between drones in a disaster response scenario using the various Kalman Filtering techniques along with sensor fusion. The second scenario involves a learning-based trajectory optimization that uses various reinforcement learning models for maintaining high video resolution and effective network performance in a civil application scenario such as aerial monitoring of persons/objects. The third scenario involves salient non-ML-based trajectory optimization techniques that can be adopted within UAV-based applications for public safety networks. We conclude with a list of open challenges and future works for intelligent path planning of drones using location prediction and trajectory optimization techniques.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1292-4_5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Maintaining a system is necessary for a time-saving life because of the comfortable lifestyle and digital security. For instance, we must be concerned about the daily road accidents by automobiles to achieve the security required to construct a smart city. Every year, hundreds of people are killed in car accidents around the world as a result of drowsy drivers. This information emphasizes the importance of a sleep sensor application in preventing such tragedies and, ultimately, saving lives. To address this challenge, we offer a unique intensive learning strategy based on neutral neural networks (CNN). The goal of the chapter is to create a working prototype of a sleepiness detection system that can help to make a smart city. The technology works by keeping an eye on the driver's eyes and sounding the warning while it dries. The system is a non-intrusive real-time control system. The main goal is to improve motorist safety without causing any disruption. The driver’s eyelid is identified in this experiment. When a motorist’s eyes are closed for a long time, the driver is regarded indifferent, and an alert sound.

The emergence of new trends in technologies contributed to the commencement of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is gaining worldwide attention as well as becoming available for monitoring, diagnosing, forecasting, and preventing emerging communicable diseases. IoT in the medical organization is advantageous and has enabled appropriate control of individuals with COVID-19 by using interconnected wearable sensors and networks. IoT is an evolving area of investigation in infectious disease epidemiology. However, the augmented dangers of communicable diseases transmitted through worldwide integration and the pervasive availability of smart types of machinery, including the interrelatedness of the world, require its utilization for monitoring, averting, predicting, and managing transmittable viruses. This has helped in reducing the circulation rate in the hospital and increasing patient satisfaction. Therefore, this chapter discusses the overall applications of IoT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the significant applications of IoT, challenges, and opportunities of deploying the technologies during the outbreak are presented. This can be of help to identify symptoms and provides better treatment for the outbreak. Taking into account the current situation worldwide, smart disease monitoring systems focused on IoT can be significantly advanced in an attempt to combat the next contagion. With the development of smartphones, wearable devices, and Internet access, IoT’s role will limit the spread of the pandemic by collecting and analyzing data already gathered.

In this paper, we thoroughly study the robustness of uncompressed, distilled, pruned and binarized neural networks against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, C&W, DeepFool, LocalSearch and GenAttack). These new insights facilitate defensive training schemes or reactive filtering methods, where the attack is detected and the input is discarded and/or cleaned. Experimental results are shown for distilled CNNs, agent-based state-of-the-art pruned models, and binarized neural networks (BNNs) such as XNOR-Net and ABC-Net, trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We present evaluation methods to simplify the comparison between CNNs under different attack schemes using loss/accuracy levels, stress-strain graphs, box-plots and class activation mapping (CAM).

Nevertheless, these devices are considered constrained to processing such applications, due to the limitation of battery capacity and high-demand computation for these applications. Mobile cloud comping (MCC) is considered as an appropriate solution for addressing this problem and battery the battery lifetime of these devices, in which the intensive-computation tasks will be offloaded and processed at a conventional centralized cloud. However, cloud computing solution introduces a high communication delay which makes the computation offloading inappropriate for processing real-time applications. To tackle the problem of delay, a new emerging paradigm has been introduced, called mobile edge computing (MEC), in which the computation and storage capabilities of cloud computing have been provided at the edge of the network that enables such applications to be processed as well as satisfying the delay requirements. To this end, compared to other surveys, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on computation offloading on edge-cloud computing combination. In addition, we provide a novel taxonomy on computation offloading at edge-cloud computing combination and introduce the most and common recent computation offloading models regarding this taxonomy.

As discussed in the previous chapter, this has led some researchers to believe that deep learning could hypothetically scale to achieve general intelligence. However, there is increasing consensus (e.g. [57, 210, 230]) that the techniques do not scale as well as was anticipated to harder problems. In particular, deep learning methods find their strength in automatically synthesizing distributed quantitative features from data. These features are useful insofar as they enable mostly reliable classification and regression, and in some limited cases also few- or zero-shot transfer to related tasks. However, it is increasingly questionable whether deep learning methods are appropriate for autonomous roles in environments that are not strongly constrained.

CAs are currently being utilised for diverse clinical applications such as symptom checking, health monitoring, medical triage and diagnosis. Intent classification (IC) is an essential task of understanding user utterance in CAs which makes use of modern deep learning (DL) methods. Because of the inherent model uncertainty associated with those methods, accuracy alone cannot be relied upon in clinical applications where certain errors may compromise patient safety. In this work, we employ Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to calculate model uncertainty for IC, with a specific emphasis on symptom checker CAs. This method provides a certainty measure with IC prediction that can be utilised in assuring safe response from CAs. We evaluated our method on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data and found mean uncertainty to be much higher for OOD data.

Possible solutions include a gesture-based control system that protects user privacy and can operate several different appliances simultaneously. When implementing such gesture-based control systems, opaque box artificial intelligence (AI) models are used. This opaque box AI model has shown good performance metrics on in-distribution data when tested in a lab. However, their complexity and opaqueness make them prone to failure when exposed to real-world out-of-distribution input. In contrast to opaque box models, explainable AI models based on fuzzy logic (EAI-FL) demonstrate comparable performance on lab data distributions.

The fast improvement in communication, sensing and computer technology has given considerable advances to Robot navigation guidance techniques in agriculture. Automatic autonomous robots minimize work expenses, avoid dangerous activities from being carried out by people and give farmers timely and accurate data to help management choices. Appropriate methods for sensing, mapping, localization, trajectory planning, and preventing obstacles are designed through research into robot sensor technologies in agricultural contexts. The Navigation Algorithms must use visual information to determine an acceptable course, execute a selection and navigate appropriately without collisions in its environment. A summary of sensor technology for autonomous prototype vehicles is presented and discussed in this chapter. Navigating sensors, computer methods, and navigation management approaches are the main aspects. Crucial procedures include selecting, coordinating, and combining the appropriate Sensors to provide essential robotics navigational knowledge. For function extraction, processing of data and fusing computationally efficiently are utilized. The steering controllers give the correct steering motion to operate automated vehicles for autonomous navigation. Mobile robots are still an open topic in outside contexts such as in agriculture.

Effective extraction from the agent’s observation, effective utilization of historical information, and efficient communication with neighbor agents are the challenges to completing the cooperative task. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a well-designed model, which utilizes the local states of nearby agents and obstacles and outputs an optimal action for each agent to execute. Our approach has three major components: 1) observation encoder which uses CNN to extract local partial observation and GRU to make full use of historical information, 2) communication block which uses attention mechanism to combine the agent’s partial observation with its neighbors, and 3) decision block with the purpose to output the final action policy. Based on the three major components, all agents formulate their own decentralized policies to apply. Finally, we use success rate and extra time rate to measure our approach and other well-known algorithms.

AI can benefit various stages of real estate development, from planning and construction to occupation and demolition. However, Hong Kong's legal system is currently behind when it comes to technological abilities, while the field of AI safety in built environments is still in its infancy. Negligent design and production processes, irresponsible data management, questionable deployment, algorithm training, sensor design and/or manufacture, unforeseen consequences from multiple data inputs, and erroneous AI operation based on sensor or remote data can all lead to accidents. Yet, determining how legal rules should apply to liability for losses caused by AI systems takes time. Traditional product liability laws can apply for some systems, meaning that the manufacturer will bear responsibility for a malfunctioning part. That said, more complex cases will undoubtedly have to come before the courts to determine whether something unsafe should be the manufacturer's fault or the individual's fault, as well as who should receive the subsequent financial and/or non-financial compensation, etc. Since AI adoption has an inevitable relationship with safety concerns, this project intends to shed light on responsible AI development and usage, with a specific focus on AI safety laws, policies, and people's perceptions. We will conduct a systematic literature review via the PRISMA approach to study the academic perspectives of AI safety policies and laws and data-mining publicly available content on social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit to study societal concerns about AI safety in built environments. We will then research court cases and laws related to AI safety in 61 jurisdictions, in addition to policies that have been implemented globally. Two case studies on AI suppliers that sell AI hardware and software to users of built environment will also be included. Another two case studies will be conducted on built environment companies (a contractor and Hong Kong International Airport) that use AI safety tools. The results obtained from social media, court cases, legislation, and policies will be discussed with local and international experts via a workshop, then released to the public to provide the international community and Hong Kong with unique policy and legal orientations.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-0737-1_3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, cameras generally capture human poses in 2D as images and videos, which can have significant appearance variations across viewpoints that make the recognition tasks challenging. To address this, we explore recognizing similarity in 3D human body poses from 2D information, which has not been well-studied in existing works. Here, we propose an approach to learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D body joint keypoints, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Input ambiguities of 2D poses from projection and occlusion are difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping, and therefore we adopt a probabilistic formulation for our embedding space. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 3D pose estimation models. We also show that by training a simple temporal embedding model, we achieve superior performance on pose sequence retrieval and largely reduce the embedding dimension from stacking frame-based embeddings for efficient large-scale retrieval. Furthermore, in order to enable our embeddings to work with partially visible input, we further investigate different keypoint occlusion augmentation strategies during training. We demonstrate that these occlusion augmentations significantly improve retrieval performance on partial 2D input poses. Results on action recognition and video alignment demonstrate that using our embeddings without any additional training achieves competitive performance relative to other models specifically trained for each task.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-021-01529-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The chapter will focus on the standard DoD acquisition program management methodology, i.e., Earned Value Management (EVM), and how it might be improved through incorporation of two methodologies, i.e., Integrated Risk Management (IRM) and Knowledge Value Added (KVA), in the managing of complex DoD information technology (i.e., AI) programs. This research compared and contrasted these three methodologies with the goal of demonstrating when and how each method can be applied to improve the acquisitions lifecycle for AI systems.

This use case is developed in the context of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 project CLASS [ 4 ]—Edge and Cloud Computation: A highly Distributed Software for Big Data Analytics. This use-case requires both real-time data processing ( data in motion ) for driving assistance and online city-wide monitoring, as well as large-scale offline processing of big data sets collected from sensors ( data at rest ). As such, it demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the CLASS software architecture to coordinate edge and cloud for big data analytics. Concretely, the CLASS smart city use case includes a range of mobility-related applications, including extended car awareness for collision avoidance, air pollution monitoring, and digital traffic sign management.

However deep learning based algorithms are often computationally expensive. That limits the use in many real world scenarios. For decades, researchers have been working on speeding up object detection. One bottleneck in current state-of-the-art methods is the region proposal generation stage as hundreds and thousands of proposed regions need to be processed before detection. Most of the regions are background areas which do not contribute to the actual detection. To improve the efficiency, we propose a region proposal network that can significantly reduce background while maintaining high accuracy. The comparison with SOTA methods shows that our network can be up to 70 times faster, since it only contains 1/15 to 1/150 parameters relative to these methods. The class IoU for MS COCO subsets achieves 40% to 70% and the inference speed on GTX 1080Ti can achieve above 1000 FPS performance. In addition, our study shows that high resolution input is not a must for high accuracy. The use of down-sampled images can further reduce computation costs while retaining or even improving accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-97546-3_50,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This P2P network is generated and maintained by the participating peers in a distributed manner through peer discovery, neighbor selection and managing inbound/outbound connections. As these tasks require extra consumption of network bandwidth, energy, memory and CPU usage, resource-limited devices may not support inherent blockchain applications. Further, changes in the topology control functions or reconfiguration should be considered by all peers to fully benefit from the new performance, which can take time. The aim of this paper is to build a blockchain network in a manner that greatly reduce topology control overhead while guaranteeing the properties such as high flexibility, fast reconfigurability, connectivity, small diameter and clustering. For this, we propose to use the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to manage the blockchain P2P network. This way, the topology control tasks are moved off the peers to a secure overlay layer composed of multiple servers having synchronized databases. This new layer is responsible for building and managing the topological structure of the P2P network layer based on random r -out digraphs. Next, we mathematically discuss r -out digraphs generation using binomial distribution and preferential attachment models. Then, and in order to reduce the number of connections per peer, we establish lower and minimum upper bounds on outbound and inbound connections respectively that still guarantee the P2P network feasibility and connectivity. Further, we investigate topological properties of blockchain P2P network such as connectivity, diameter and clustering. Finally, we provide extensive simulation and numerical results to verify the efficiency of our approach and illustrate the effects of centralized topology control on network performance.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01248-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The sustainable development of transport requires the development of activities, which yield higher economic and social results while at the same time reduce the negative impact on the environment. In the long term, the sustainable development of transport activities is complex and tied to enormous challenges, difficulties and barriers, related to the development of the technological environment, the social and economic development, the influence of political factors and regulations. One of the central perspectives for the development of the freight transport in Europe is the development of multimodal and intermodal transport. The present chapter reviews some essential issues about the conditions for interaction between the modes of freight transport and the main challenges this kind of transport faces. An overview has been made of the main characteristics of organization and technology in multimodal and intermodal transport, and the related to them commodal and synchro modal transport that have appeared in recent years, as well as the physical internet concept. The application and barriers for modern use of information and communication technologies in multimodal and intermodal transport has been reviewed. An overview of the development of multimodal and intermodal transport in Bulgaria in accordance with the development of international transport corridors that pass through the country is carried out. A mathematical model has been developed on the basis of multicriteria optimization with three criteria: direct costs, time and external costs. The transport scheme is presented as an oriented graph line with each point corresponding to a node and each road, connecting nodes i and j, to an oriented weighted rib (i, j) in the graph. Weight c ij is directly connected to the three criteria set. We assume that on each rib transport can be carried out by three modes: waterway, road and rail. If there is no physical connection, the respective weight is assumed to be an infinitely large number. Pareto optimal solutions have been determined under conditions for integer variables and application of a weighting method. To verify the model, a specific task for providing multimodal transport has been solved with the help of Matlab R2017b software and the optimization functions built into the product have been found to be optimal under Pareto solutions, using heuristic approaches for solving a partially integer linear optimization problem.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87120-8_2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the safety critical and real time nature of such systems, this transition emphasizes careful selection of task models, task scheduling mechanisms and software development practices to ensure predictability. Though there exists a wealth of research results on MCS, often the non-uniform descriptions and non-comprehensive nature of task parameters become hindrances to the designers and researchers, thus limiting their wider applicability. In this context, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of task parameters for MCS and propose a task parameter aggregator called TaskMUSTER with focus on automotive domain, specifically on the controlling domain software applications like power steering, brake systems and power train. TaskMSUTER aims to provide a unified view of various task model parameters in terms of important attributes related to resource & communication, energy, fault-tolerance, mode change, OS overheads and parallel processing.

Automated vehicles (AVs) have become central tools for such projects as city governments and industry explore the use and impact of this emerging technology. This paper presents a large-scale assessment of AV pilot projects in U.S. cities to understand how pilot projects are being used to examine the risks and benefits of AVs, how cities integrate these potentially transformative technologies into conventional policy and planning, and how and what they are learning about this technology and its future opportunities and risks. Through interviews with planning practitioners and document analysis, we demonstrate that the approaches cities take for AVs differ significantly, and often lack coherent policy goals. Key findings from this research include: (1) a disconnect between the goals of the pilot projects and a city’s transportation goals; (2) cities generally lack a long-term vision for how AVs fit into future mobility systems and how they might help address transportation goals; (3) an overemphasis of non-transportation benefits of AV pilots projects; (4) AV pilot projects exhibit a lack of policy learning and iteration; and (5) cities are not leveraging pilot projects for public benefits. Overall, urban and transportation planners and decision makers show a clear interest to discover how AVs can be used to address transportation challenges in their communities, but our research shows that while AV pilot projects purport to do this, while having numerous outcomes, they have limited value for informing transportation policy and planning questions around AVs. We also find that AV pilot projects, as presently structured, may constrain planners’ ability to re-think transportation systems within the context of rapid technological change.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-01006-2,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Up to now, those qualities are solely measured in technical terms, but not in ethical ones, despite the significant role of training and annotation data in supervised machine learning. This is the first study to fill this gap by describing new dimensions of data quality for supervised machine learning applications. Based on the rationale that different social and psychological backgrounds of individuals correlate in practice with different modes of human–computer-interaction, the paper describes from an ethical perspective how varying qualities of behavioral data that individuals leave behind while using digital technologies have socially relevant ramification for the development of machine learning applications. The specific objective of this study is to describe how training data can be selected according to ethical assessments of the behavior it originates from, establishing an innovative filter regime to transition from the big data rationale n  =  all to a more selective way of processing data for training sets in machine learning. The overarching aim of this research is to promote methods for achieving beneficial machine learning applications that could be widely useful for industry as well as academia.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-021-09573-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The increased integration of IoT devices, faster access to the Internet, and advances in the computational power of mainstream devices have drastically increased the feasibility for the same while making it more practical to implement gradually. The reach and applicability of Big Data are diversified, yet widespread, and one of its key implementations falls under the environment arena. In an attempt to provide novel Big Data allied solutions in one or more aspects of water management sector, a substantial amount of research work has been carried out in recent years. This paper discusses how Big Data influences the abovementioned arenas and the extent of importance that it has. Several aspects of this field are uprooted, are discussed, and have seen real-world applicability. Various presently deployed applications, in the sub-fields of environment and water management are studied, and given an inclusive review. Finally, the current challenges and limitations pertaining to Big Data are discussed and proper (in theory) solutions are proposed which seem to have promising results. The future scope of Big Data is also considered with its viability taken into consideration.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no framework for motion planning has yet been published which allows for the true implementation of any practical ethical policies. This paper makes four contributions: Firstly, we briefly present the state of the art based on recent works concerning unavoidable accidents of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and identify further need for research. While most of the research focuses on decision strategies in moral dilemmas or crash optimization, we aim to develop an ethical trajectory planning for all situations on public roads. Secondly, we discuss several ethical theories and argue for the adoption of the theory “ethics of risk.” Thirdly, we propose a new framework for trajectory planning, with uncertainties and an assessment of risks. In this framework, we transform ethical specifications into mathematical equations and thus create the basis for the programming of an ethical trajectory. We present a risk cost function for trajectory planning that considers minimization of the overall risk, priority for the worst-off and equal treatment of people.

While the advent of connected mobility is expected to benefit travelers and the society by smoothing traffic, improving rider convenience, and reducing accidents, the augmented cyber components in connected and autonomous vehicles and related infrastructure also give rise to cyber-attacks to the transportation system. And yet, little attention has been paid to transportation cyber resilience. This paper thus proposes an investigation on this topic with a comprehensive literature review. The cyber components and plausible autonomous mobility systems (AMS) operation scenarios are discussed, before identifying possible cyber-attacks to AMS at both vehicle and system levels. The discussion then moves to existing practices to enhance cybersecurity, and a number of strategies are investigated toward enhancing AMS cyber resilience. At the vehicle level, creating layers and separation to reduce cyber component connectivity and deploying an independent procedure for data collection and processing are important in vehicle design and manufacturing. At the system level, recommended strategies include keeping redundancy in transportation capacity, maintaining a separate road network, and deploying different sub-autonomous mobility systems.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12198-021-00230-w,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Before such a platoon is deployed, it is necessary to ensure the safety of its driving behavior, whereby each vehicle’s behavior is commanded by the decision-making function whose decision is based on the observed driving scenario. However, there is currently a lack of verification methods to ensure the reliability of the scenario-based decision-making process in the platoon system. In this paper, we focus on the platoon driving scenario, whereby the platoon is composed of intelligent heavy trucks driving on cross-sea highways. We propose a formal modeling and verification approach to provide safety assurance for platoon vehicles’ cooperative driving behaviors. The existing Multi-Lane Spatial Logic (MLSL) with a dedicated abstract model can express driving scene spatial properties and prove the safety of multi-lane traffic maneuvers under the single-vehicle perspective. To cater for the platoon system’s multi-vehicle perspective, we modify the existing abstract model and propose a Multi-Agent Spatial Logic (MASL) that extends MLSL by relative orientation and multi-agent observation. We then utilize a timed automata type supporting MASL formulas to model vehicles’ decision controllers for platoon driving. Taking the behavior of a human-driven vehicle (HDV) joining the platoon as a case study, we have implemented the model and verified safety properties on the UPPAAL tool to illustrate the viability of our framework.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11390-021-1565-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent ethical reports and guidelines raise worries that AVs will introduce injustice or reinforce existing social inequalities in road traffic. One major injustice concern in today’s traffic is that different types of road users are exposed differently to risks of corporal harm. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the responsibility of AV developers to address existing injustice concerns regarding risk exposure as well as approaches on how to fulfill the responsibility for a fairer distribution of risk. In contrast to popular approaches on the ethics of risk distribution in unavoidable accident cases, we focus on low and moderate risk situations, referred to as routine driving. For routine driving, the obligation to distribute risks fairly must be discussed in the context of risk-taking and risk-acceptance, balancing safety objectives of occupants and other road users with driving utility. In the second part of the paper, we present a typical architecture for decentralized automated driving which contains a dedicated module for real-time risk estimation and management.

This paper focuses on a lightweight real-time vehicle detection model developed to run on common computing devices. This method can be developed on low power systems (e.g. devices without GPUs or low power GPU modules), relying on the proposed real-time lightweight algorithm. The system employs an end-to-end approach for identifying, locating, and classifying vehicles in the images. The pre-trained Tiny-YOLOv3 network is adopted as the main reference model and subsequently pruned and simplified by training on the BIT-vehicle dataset, and excluding some of the unnecessary layers. The results indicated advantages of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and speed. Also, the network is capable to detect and classify six different types of vehicles with MAP = 95.05%, at the speed of 17 fps.

So, it is important to build an automatic system to collect information about vehicles. The license plate is the unique identifier of a vehicle.

The proposed system was based on the Faster R-CNN improved by adding an adaptive attention network for the segmentation of the license plate to retrieve the numbers and the letters of identification. Also, we add a deconvolution layer at the top of the features extraction network to detect the small size of the target license plate. To train and evaluate the proposed system, a dataset was collected for Arabic countries such as Egypt, KSA, and UAE that have similar license plates with Arabic and Indian numbers, Arabic and Latin alphabets. The dataset was collected from the internet using a python script then it was filtered and annotated manually.

Reviewing current traffic rules with particular reference to two driving situations (speeding and mounting the pavement), we illustrate why current traffic rules are not suitable for CAVs and why making new traffic rules specifically for CAVs would be inappropriate. In defining an alternative approach to achieving safe CAV driving behaviours, we describe the use of ethical goal functions as part of hybrid AI systems, suggesting that functions should be defined by governmental bodies with input from citizens and stakeholders. Ethical goal functions for CAVs would enable developers to optimise driving behaviours for safety under conditions of uncertainty whilst allowing for differentiation of products according to brand values. Such functions can differ between regions according to preferences for safety behaviours within that region and can be updated over time, responding to continual socio-technological feedback loops. We conclude that defining ethical goal functions is an urgent and necessary step from governmental bodies to enable the safe and transparent operation of CAVs and accelerate the reduction in road casualties they promise to achieve.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-021-09614-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A main challenge comes from each modality capturing a different location of the 3D objects, as opposed to typical multi-spectral imaging scenarios where all image bands observe the same scene. Thus, we refer to this special multi-spectral scenario as multi-layer . We present a multi-task deep learning framework that exploits the dependencies between image bands to produce 3D AR localisation (segmentation and detection) where different image bands (and physical locations) have their own set of results. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of producing dense AR annotations for training supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, we adapt a training strategy based on weak labels (i.e. bounding boxes) in a recursive manner. We compare our detection and segmentation stages against baseline approaches for solar image analysis (multi-channel coronal hole detection, SPOCA for ARs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods (Faster RCNN, U-Net). Additionally, both detection and segmentation stages are quantitatively validated on artificially created data of similar spatial configurations made from annotated multi-modal magnetic resonance images. Our framework achieves an average of 0.72 IoU (segmentation) and 0.90 F1 score (detection) across all modalities, comparing to the best performing baseline methods with scores of 0.53 and 0.58, respectively, on the artificial dataset, and 0.84 F1 score in the AR detection task comparing to baseline of 0.82 F1 score.

The DNN-based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviours due to unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. Therefore, safety assurance is vital to the ADS. However, DNN-based ADS is a highly complex system that puts forward a strong demand for robustness, more specifically, the ability to predict unexpected driving conditions to prevent potential inconsistent behaviour. It is not possible to generalize the DNN model’s performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the driving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis–based anomaly detection system to prevent the safety-critical inconsistent behaviour of autonomous vehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components. The first component- the inconsistent behaviour predictor, is based on an autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios. Based on reconstruction error ( e ) and threshold ( θ ), it determines the normal and unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behaviour. The second component provides on-the-fly safety guards, that is, it automatically activates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behaviour. We evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous driving scenarios using already available open-sourced DNN-based ADSs in the Udacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of DeepGuard can predict up to 93% on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83% on DAVE-2 ADS, and 80% of inconsistent behaviour on the EPOCH ADS model, outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad . Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89% of all predicted inconsistent behaviours of ADS by executing predefined safety guards.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-021-00310-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Through surveys, interviews, technology and infrastructure design, and experimentation, we developed a tradespace model of those variables that managers and designers of high-risk settings like public spaces and prisons need to consider in their development or renovation. These include cost considerations, both capital and infrastructure, as well as technology design elements of range and false alarm rates potentially exacerbated by convolutional neural networks (aka, deep learning). Results also highlight that environmental design elements can provide a possible low-tech solution in the design of obstructions that either eliminate or complicate a drone pilot’s line of sight.

Quantum technologies are dual-use technologies, and as such are of interest to the defence and security industry and military and governmental actors. This report reviews and maps the possible quantum technology military applications, serving as an entry point for international peace and security assessment, ethics research, military and governmental policy, strategy and decision making. Quantum technologies for military applications introduce new capabilities, improving effectiveness and increasing precision, thus leading to ‘quantum warfare’, wherein new military strategies, doctrines, policies and ethics should be established. This report provides a basic overview of quantum technologies under development, also estimating the expected time scale of delivery or the utilisation impact.

This paper reports findings about accountable AI from 26 interviews conducted with stakeholders in AI drawn from the fields of AI research, law, and policy. Participants described the challenges presented by the distributed nature of how AI systems are designed, developed, deployed, and regulated. This distribution of agency, alongside existing mechanisms of accountability, responsibility, and liability, creates barriers for effective accountable design. As agency is distributed across the socio-technical landscape of an AI system, users without deep knowledge of the operation of these systems become disempowered, unable to challenge or contest when it impacts their lives. In this context, accountability becomes a matter of building systems that can be challenged, interrogated, and, most importantly, adjusted in use to accommodate counter-intuitive results and unpredictable impacts. Thus, accountable system design can work to reconfigure socio-technical landscapes to protect the users of AI and to prevent unjust apportionment of risk.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01302-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Both tools have been shown to be successful in delivering data-driven solutions for robotics tasks, as well as providing a natural way to develop an end-to-end pipeline from the robot’s sensing to its actuation, passing through the generation of a policy to perform the given task. These frameworks have been proven to be able to deal with real-world complications such as noise in sensing, imprecise actuation, variability in the scenarios where the robot is being deployed, among others. Following that vein, and given the growing interest in DL and DRL, the present work starts by providing a brief tutorial on deep reinforcement learning, where the goal is to understand the main concepts and approaches followed in the field. Later, the article describes the main, recent, and most promising approaches of DL and DRL in robotics, with sufficient technical detail to understand the core of the works and to motivate interested readers to initiate their own research in the area. Then, to provide a comparative analysis, we present several taxonomies in which the references can be classified, according to high-level features, the task that the work addresses, the type of system, and the learning techniques used in the work.

Scientists have tested the power of intelligent algorithms developed to predict (or learn from) natural, physical and social phenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems. Nonetheless, studies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI and crime are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics in this area? What is the structure of scientific collaboration when considering works investigating criminal issues using machine learning, deep learning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this specific scientific sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this work quantitatively analyzes 692 published works at the intersection between AI and crime employing network science to respond to these questions. Results show that researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that relevant themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are considerably overlooked. Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected structure of co-authorship networks. Such disconnectedness may represent a substantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists interested in these topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates that countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are generally less central in the network. This means that scholars working in highly productive countries (e.g. the United States, China) tend to mostly collaborate domestically.

However, researchers found that deep neural networks, as the core algorithm of deep learning technology, are vulnerable to adversarial examples. The adversarial examples are some special input examples which were added small magnitude and carefully crafted perturbations to yield erroneous results with extremely confidence. Hence, they bring serious security risks to deep-learning-based systems. Furthermore, adversarial examples exist not only in the digital world, but also in the physical world. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in the real physical world. First, we reviewed these works that can successfully generate adversarial examples in the digital world, analyzed the challenges faced by applications in real environments. Then, we compare and summarize the work of adversarial examples on image classification tasks, target detection tasks, and speech recognition tasks.

In the current study, we have proposed a framework for reinforcement learning in decentralized collision avoidance where each agent independently makes its decision without communication with others. In an environment exposed to various kinds of dynamic obstacles with irregular movements, mobile robot agents could learn how to avoid obstacles and reach a target point efficiently. Moreover, a path planner was integrated with the reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance to solve the problem of not finding a path in a specific situation, thereby imposing path efficiency. The robots were trained about the policy of obstacle avoidance in environments where dynamic characteristics were considered with soft actor critic algorithm. The trained policy was implemented in the robot operating system (ROS), tested in virtual and real environments for the differential drive wheel robot to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper presents three novel versions of a hybrid method designed to assist in planning such paths for these robots. In this paper, an improvement on Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, namely Adapted-RRT, is presented that uses three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Incremental Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO), and Expanded Grey Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). RRT variants, using these algorithms, are named Adapted-RRT GWO , Adapted-RRT I-GWO , and Adapted-RRT Ex-GWO . The most significant shortcoming of the methods in the original sampling-based algorithm is their inability in finding the optimal paths. On the other hand, the metaheuristic-based algorithms are disadvantaged as they demand a predetermined knowledge of intermediate stations. This study is novel in that it uses the advantages of sampling and metaheuristic methods while eliminating their shortcomings. In these methods, two important operations (length and direction of each movement) are defined that play an important role in selecting the next stations and generating an optimal path. They try to find solutions close to the optima without collision, while providing comparatively efficient execution time and space complexities. The proposed methods have been simulated employing four different maps for three unmanned aerial vehicles, with diverse sets of starting and ending points. The results have been compared among a total of 11 algorithms. The comparison of results shows that the proposed path planning methods generally outperform various algorithms, namely BPIB-RRT*, tGSRT, GWO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, PSO, Improved BA, and WOA.

Five main perspectives about AMAs emerged from our data and were subsequently interpreted and discussed: (i) Machine Ethics: The Way Forward; (ii) Ethical Verification: Safe and Sufficient; (iii) Morally Uncertain Machines: Human Values to Avoid Moral Dystopia; (iv) Human Exceptionalism: Machines Cannot Moralize; and (v) Machine Objectivism: Machines as Superior Moral Agents. A potential source of these differing perspectives is the failure of Machine Ethics to be widely observed or explored as an applied ethic and more than a futuristic end.

After the scheduling, each drone transmits its own data to its associated MEC for enhancing the quality and then eventually the data will be used for surveillance.

While a majority of respondents consider themselves to have little knowledge and familiarity with the topic of AI, the survey nevertheless finds considerable range of relatively ‘plausible’ basic understandings of what AI is. Significantly, repeated questioning highlights a willingness among many people to reassess their opinions once having received further information about AI, and being asked to think through issues relating to AI and society. These patterns remain relatively consistent, regardless of respondents’ political orientation, income, social class and other demographic characteristics. As such, the paper concludes by considering how these findings provide support for the development of public education efforts to further enhance what might be termed ‘public understanding of AI’.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01268-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper introduces density-scaling traffic management for autonomous vehicle driving scenarios. The proposed technique relies on navigation output and the autonomous vehicles' trajectory decisions for predicting their availability and time duration. The traffic flow is streamlines based on the predictions; the prediction error is mitigated by rescheduling the successive traffic flow. In this process, predictive iterated learning is employed for improving the scalable traffic flows in an intersection. The predictive learning handles navigation assistance output change of trajectory independently and correlates the decisions' match. The process of prediction matching is performed for improving the flow management with the time factor.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aims to manage and optimize the traffic congestion, road accidents, parking allocation using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) system, where the AVs are internally connected for message passing and critical decision making in time-sensitive applications. The data security in such applications can be offered using Blockchain (BC) technology. But, as per the existing literature, there exists no system which can call AVs automatically based on the situation, i.e., call an ambulance in case of an accident, call logistic service in case of home transfer, and call the traffic department in case of traffic jam. Motivated from the aforementioned reasons, in this article, we propose a BC-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for AV system using beyond 5G communication network. Recently, AVs are facing issues with sensing and tracking technology as well as the data thefts. AV system contains sensitive information and transfers it through a communication channel to Connected AVs (CAVs), where the corrupted information or delay of a fraction of a second can lead to a critical situation. So, here we present possib the attacks and safety countermeasures using BC technology to protect the AV system. The proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and tracking of an object through BC by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers. Also, the beyond 5G network enables communications with low latency and high reliability to meet the desires of the aforementioned time-sensitive applications. The proposed system is evaluated by considering the parameters as mobility and data transfer time against the traditional LTE-A and 5G communication networks.

In this paper, we discuss how inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) can be employed to retrieve the reward function implicitly optimized by expert agents acting in real applications. Scaling IRL to real-world cases has proved challenging as typically only a fixed dataset of demonstrations is available and further interactions with the environment are not allowed. For this reason, we resort to a class of truly batch model-free IRL algorithms and we present three application scenarios: (1) the high-level decision-making problem in the highway driving scenario, and (2) inferring the user preferences in a social network (Twitter), and (3) the management of the water release in the Como Lake. For each of these scenarios, we provide formalization, experiments and a discussion to interpret the obtained results.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-020-05939-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

As we all know, deep learning is effective and essential for the development of AI components of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, it is challenging to adopt multi-source heterogenous data in deep learning. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven approach for the delivery of high-quality Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Data (STTD) to AVs, which can be deployed to assist the development of AI components with deep learning. The novelty of our work is that the meta-model of STTD is constructed based on the domain knowledge of autonomous driving. Our approach, including collection, preprocessing, storage and modeling of STTD as well as the training of AI components, helps to process and utilize huge amount of STTD efficiently. To further demonstrate the usability of our approach, a case study of vehicle behavior prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is discussed.

Equipped with domain randomization, Air Learning exposes a UAV agent to a diverse set of challenging scenarios. We seed the toolset with point-to-point obstacle avoidance tasks in three different environments and Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) trainers. Air Learning assesses the policies’ performance under various quality-of-flight (QoF) metrics, such as the energy consumed, endurance, and the average trajectory length, on resource-constrained embedded platforms like a Raspberry Pi. We find that the trajectories on an embedded Ras-Pi are vastly different from those predicted on a high-end desktop system, resulting in up to $$40\%$$ 40 % longer trajectories in one of the environments. To understand the source of such discrepancies, we use Air Learning to artificially degrade high-end desktop performance to mimic what happens on a low-end embedded system. We then propose a mitigation technique that uses the hardware-in-the-loop to determine the latency distribution of running the policy on the target platform (onboard compute on aerial robot). A randomly sampled latency from the latency distribution is then added as an artificial delay within the training loop. Training the policy with artificial delays allows us to minimize the hardware gap (discrepancy in the flight time metric reduced from 37.73% to 0.5%). Thus, Air Learning with hardware-in-the-loop characterizes those differences and exposes how the onboard compute’s choice affects the aerial robot’s performance. We also conduct reliability studies to assess the effect of sensor failures on the learned policies. All put together, Air Learning enables a broad class of deep RL research on UAVs.

Developing an effective scaling technique is not merely a big concern, but how to achieve autonomic scaling results using future load prediction and migration policies is also a crucial phase. Also, to evaluate such auto-scaling strategy, certain Quality of Service (QoS) metrics must be recognized, explored and leveraged to enhance the performance of the system.

Based on a vast systematic review of the literature on Artificial Intelligence Regulation (AIR) published between 2010 and 2020, a dispersed body of knowledge loosely centred around the “framework” concept was organised, described, and pictured for better understanding. The resulting integrative framework encapsulates 21 prior depictions of the policy-making process, aiming to achieve gold-standard societal values, such as fairness, freedom and long-term sustainability. This challenge of integrating the AIR literature was matched by the identification of a structural common ground among different approaches. The AIR framework results from an effort to identify and later analytically deduce synthetic, and generic tool for a country-specific, stakeholder-aware analysis of AIR matters. Theories and principles as diverse as Agile and Ethics were combined in the “AIR framework”, which provides a conceptual lens for societies to think collectively and make informed policy decisions related to what, when, and how the uses and applications of AI should be regulated. Moreover, the AIR framework serves as a theoretically sound starting point for endeavours related to AI regulation, from legislation to research and development. As we know, the (potential) impacts of AI on society are immense, and therefore the discourses, social negotiations, and applications of this technology should be guided by common grounds based on contemporary governance techniques, and social values legitimated via dialogue and scientific research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10676-021-09593-z,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we analyze a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems organized in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems.

The horizon of the applications of AI and deep learning has changed the perspective of the human mind. Initially, what used to be thought of as the subtle impossible task is applicable today, and that too in the feasibly efficient way. Computer vision tasks powered with highly tuned CNNs are outperforming humans in many fields. Introductory implementations of the autonomous vehicle were merely achieved using raw image processing, and hard programmed rule-based logic systems along with machine/deep learning were used as secondary objective handlers. With the autonomous driving method proposed by Nvidia, the usability of CNNs is more adequate, adaptable, and applicable. In this paper, we propose the ensemble implementation of CNN-based regression models for autonomous driving. We have taken simulator generated driving view image dataset along with a mapped file of steering angle in radians. After applying image pre-processing and augmentation, we have used two CNN models along with their ensemble and compared their performance to minimize the risks of unsafe driving. We have compared Nvidia proposed CNN, MobileNet-V2 as regression model and Ensemble-M results for comparison of their respective performance, MSE scores and compute time to process. In result analysis, the MobileNet-V2 model performs better in densely featured roads and the Nvidia model performs better in sparsely featured roads, whereas Ensemble-M normalizes the performance of both models and efficiently results in the least MSE score (0.0201) with the highest computation time utilization making autonomous driving better, safer alternative.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-05954-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Our first algorithm, hierarchical hotspot information gathering, uses a topological state space partitioning by constructing a high-level map of information hotspots. We then solve a global scheduling problem over the topological graph, the solution of which is then used for path planning by a set of local greedy coverage planners within each hotspot. Our second algorithm, Topology-Aware Self Organizing Maps, extends the Self Organizing Map algorithm to discover prominent topological features in the information function. These features are used to perform a topological path space decomposition to provide a Stochastic Gradient Ascent optimization algorithm with topologically diverse initialization, improving its performance. In simulated trials and field experiments, we compare the tradeoffs of these two approaches and show that our methods that leverage topological features of the information field consistently perform competitively or better than methods that do not exploit these features, while requiring less computation time.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10514-021-10012-x,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Having UAVs arranged in rings fosters an early detection (outer ring) while increases the reliability of the surveillance system featuring a last detection barrier (inner ring). Using the first return map from a chaotic attractor (an unpredictable sequence of real numbers) and a dynamic pheromone map, the UAV swarm members make a collective decision about their trajectories evaluating the options of a best-of- n problem. As a result, routes are unpredictable and detection rates are optimised. The parameters of each UAV, i.e. amount of pheromones and ring assignation, has been tuned using a specifically designed evolutionary algorithm. The performance of CONSOLE has been compared to five state-of-the-art mobility models on 20 case studies comprising 30 different scenarios each.

However, due to the intrinsic openness of wireless communication channels in IoD, the data generated by drones are facing new security challenges and privacy issues. To ensure the confidentiality of data communication, it is crucial to authenticate remote users and establish session keys for IoD through the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Unfortunately, most existing AKA protocols using asymmetric cryptographic primitives are computationally expensive, and are unaffordable for the computing power limited drones. To this end, this paper presents an efficient three-factor AKA protocol for IoD based on FourQ and Boyko-Peinado-Venkatesan (BPV) pre-calculation. The detailed security analysis reveals that our protocol is secure against known attacks and achieves important security goals, especially perfect forward secrecy. Besides, by performing real world experiments on the Raspberry Pi, we demonstrate that the improved FourQ curve primitive is 4–5 times faster than the conventional elliptic curve primitives.

As the number of interconnected devices increases, sensitive data disclosure becomes an important issue that needs to be addressed. In order to prevent the disclosure of sensitive data, effective and feasible privacy preservation strategies are necessary. A noise-based privacy-preserving model has been proposed in this article. The components of the noise-based privacy-preserving model include Multilevel Noise Treatment for data collection; user preferences-based data classifier to classify sensitive and non-sensitive data; Noise Removal and Fuzzification Mechanism for data access and user-customized privacy preservation mechanism. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed model. The results have been compared with existing approaches. The experimental results show an improvement in the proposed noise-based privacy-preserving model in terms of computational overhead. The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model without the fuzzifier has around 52–77% less computational overhead than the Data access control scheme and 46–70% less computational overhead compared to the Dynamic Privacy Protection model. The proposed model with the fuzzifier has around 48–73% less computational overhead compared to the Data access control scheme and 31–63% less computational overhead compared to the Dynamic Privacy Protection model. Furthermore, the privacy analysis has been done with the relevant approaches.

In fact, they traditionally rely on well-designed extrinsic rewards, which limits their applicability to many real-world tasks where rewards are naturally sparse. While cloning behaviors provided by an expert is a promising approach to the exploration problem, learning from a fixed set of demonstrations may be impracticable due to lack of state coverage or distribution mismatch—when the learner’s goal deviates from the demonstrated behaviors. Besides, we are interested in learning how to reach a wide range of goals from the same set of demonstrations. In this work we propose a novel goal-conditioned method that leverages very small sets of goal-driven demonstrations to massively accelerate the learning process. Crucially, we introduce the concept of active goal-driven demonstrations to query the demonstrator only in hard-to-learn and uncertain regions of the state space. We further present a strategy for prioritizing sampling of goals where the disagreement between the expert and the policy is maximized.

These networks depend upon the mobility of vehicular-relay nodes, which can adopt the store–carry–forward arrangement and provide consent to utilize their resources for packet forwarding. In reality, vehicular-relay nodes drop packets because of a lack of resources and selfish behavior, leading to potential failures in networks. The reason for this failure in performance is the absence of an efficient relay node selection strategy. Typically, vehicular delay networks can provide communication solutions in challenging conditions when other traditional networks fail to perform due to disconnection. However, if the routing strategy does not consider nodes’ selfish nature and relay nodes’ inefficiency, packet drops continue, and the approach will fail to perform. This paper proposes a routing strategy, known as the best-choice vehicular-relay selection strategy for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) transmission, to overcome this breakdown situation. The proposed strategy selects the best-performing vehicular-relay nodes and restricts the packet replication to low-performing vehicular nodes. The proposed routing strategy selects the best-choice relay nodes based on their past performance. Numerical analysis and our simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms some of the leading routing strategies in its class by increasing the delivery probability, decreasing the overhead ratio, average latency, and the number of dropped packets in the vehicular network.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06106-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Second, leakage of sensitive personal information still occurs during the training process. Thus, a system that can effectively protect the sensitive information while improving the energy efficiency is urgently required for a mobile-based federated learning system. This paper proposes SmartDL, an energy-aware decremental learning framework that well balances the energy efficiency and data privacy in an efficient manner. SmartDL improves the energy efficiency from two levels: (1) global layer, which adopts an optimization approach to select a subset of participating devices with sufficient capacity and maximum reward. (2) local layer, which adopts a novel decremental learning algorithm to actively provides the decremental and incremental updates, and can adaptively tune the local DVFS at the same time. We prototyped SmartDL on physical testbed and evaluated its performance using several learning benchmarks with real-world traces. The evaluation results show that compared with the original federated learning, SmartDL can reduce energy consumption by 75.6–82.4% in different datasets. Moreover, SmartDL achieves a speedup of 2–4 orders of magnitude in model convergence while ensuring the accuracy of the model.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06378-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and the only way to fight with it is to follow social distancing and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Moreover, this virus is increasing exponentially day-by-day and a huge amount of data from this disease is also generated at the fast pace. So, there is a need to store, manage, and analyze this huge amount of data efficiently to get meaningful insights from it, which further helps medical professionals to tackle this global pandemic situation. Moreover, this data is to be passed through an open channel, i.e., the Internet, which opens the doors for the intruders to perform some malicious activities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data in an efficient, transparent manner and also preserve the privacy of all the stakeholders. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the adoption of BC to tackle COVID-19 situations. We also present a case study on BC-based digital vaccine passports and analyzed its complexity.

However, these road intersections are generally represented as point elements without detailed information, or are even not available in current versions of crowdsourced mapping databases including OpenStreetMap (OSM). This study proposes an approach to automatically detect road objects from street-level images and place them to correct locations according to urban rules. Our processing pipeline relies on two convolutional neural networks: the first one segments the images, while the second one detects and classifies the specific objects. Moreover, to locate the detected objects, we propose an attributed topological binary tree (ATBT) based on urban rules for each image in an image sequence to depict the coherent relations of topologies, attributes and semantics of the road objects. Then the ATBT is further matched with map features on OSM to determine the right placed location. The proposed method has been applied to a case study in Berlin, Germany. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two object classes: traffic signs and traffic lights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed app roach provides promising results in terms of completeness and positional accuracy.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43762-021-00019-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

These networks, though, have achieved good recognition accuracy, they incur high computational costs and memory utilization. These issues restrict their deployment in real-world applications, which demands the FER systems to run on resource-constrained embedded devices in real-time. Thus, to alleviate these issues and to develop a robust and efficient method for automatic recognition of facial emotions in the wild with real-time performance, this paper presents a novel deep integrated CNN model, named EmNet (Emotion Network). The EmNet model consists of two structurally similar DCNN models and their integrated variant, jointly-optimized using a joint-optimization technique. For a given facial image, the EmNet gives three predictions, which are fused using two fusion schemes, namely average fusion and weighted maximum fusion, to obtain the final decision. To test the efficiency of the proposed FER pipeline on a resource-constrained embedded platform, we optimized the EmNet model and the face detector using TensorRT SDK and deploy the complete FER pipeline on the Nvidia Xavier device. Our proposed EmNet model with 4.80M parameters and 19.3MB model size attains notable improvement over the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy with multi-fold improvement in computational efficiency.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02125-0,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Border patrol agents act as moving sensors in a border region, and the border patrol agents’ coverage moves around the region dynamically, increasing the chance of approaching a trespassing agent. Typically, the locations of trespassing agents cannot be fully observed due to the size of the border region and obstacles. In addition, intelligent trespassing agents may dynamically adjust their traveling paths so that the border patrol agents cannot predict their locations easily. Trespassing agents are assumed to leave traces that indicate their footprints, providing their estimated locations. Border patrol agents may use the trespassers’ footprints as partial information to leverage patrol path planning. We propose an adaptive border patrol process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which an individual border patrol agent’s decision is determined dynamically on the basis of trespassing agents’ partially observed locations. The observations are shared among individual border patrol agents, allowing the border patrol agents to cooperate. The zoning technique is used to limit the planning scope of an individual border patrol agent, and Monte Carlo simulation is applied to reduce the complexity of the POMDP planning problem. Empirical experiments are conducted by means of simulated agents. The simulation parameters are derived from the interviews with a group of border patrol experts. The results in different scenarios show that the proposed patrol path planning scheme outperforms other patrol path planning schemes in terms of the trespasser detection rate. The simulation results are validated with respect to subject matter experts (SMEs), where SMEs are the same border patrol experts who had given the interviews. The proposed method has potential in border surveillance as an assisting system for human border patrol or an automated guidance system in robots or drones.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-020-02068-6,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Modeling and field-testing efforts are demonstrating that shared mobility coupled with AV technology for automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) service may significantly impact levels of service and environmental outcomes in future cities. Given these rapidly emerging developments, there is an urgent need for methods to adequately quantify the economic impacts of new vehicle technologies and future urban mobility policy. In this paper, we show how broader user-centric impacts can be captured by the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, which takes advantage of the rich data and outcomes of utility-maximization activity-based models and its interaction with mesoscale agent-based traffic simulation frameworks. Using the SimMobility simulator, we evaluate shared AMoD strategies applied to a Singapore micromodel city testbed. A near-future strategy of exclusive availability of AMoD service in the central business district (CBD), and a further-horizon strategy of the full operation of AMoD city-wide in the absence of other on-demand services, were tested and evaluated. Our results provide insights into the income and accessibility effects on the population under the implementation of shared and automated mobility policies. The outcomes indicate that the city-wide deployment of AMoD results in greater accessibility and network performance. Moreover, the accessibility of low-income individuals is improved relative to that of mid- and high-income individuals. The restriction of AMoD to the CBD along with the operation of other on-demand services, however, provides a certain level of disbenefit to segments of the population in two exceptional cases. The first is to high-income individuals who live in a suburban zone and rely heavily on on-demand services; the second is to mid-income residents that have excellent public transportation coverage with close proximity to the CBD. We further establish the efficacy of the ABA measure, as these findings motivate the need for measuring socioeconomic impacts at the individual level. The work presented here serves as a foundation for policy evaluation in real-world urban models for future mobility paradigms.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-020-10106-y,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The emerging reinforcement learning-based task offloading strategies have attracted attention of researchers, but the incomplete Markov models in them result in limited improvements.

The Graph Convolutional Network is introduced to extract features from tasks through regarding the task set as a directed acyclic graph. Then we construct a complete Markov model for the offloading strategy. In the proposed GRL-based method, the decision process is deployed in the user layer, while the training process is deployed in the cloud layer. An off-policy reinforcement learning method, soft actor-critic, is used to train the offloading strategy, by which the sampling and training can be implemented separately.

The spread of fire in enclosed compartments is a highly uncertain and nonlinear process. Hence, in safety-critical cases, any false negatives pose a serious threat to the safety of individuals such as firefighters that are engaged in rescue activities. This work aims to model the nonlinear fire spread behaviour as a temporal, deep learning-based regressive methodology. The objective is to efficiently identify abrupt and extreme temperature changes that often result in increases of 300+ °C. A major challenge in such time-series models is that of learning from historic time-series samples which are known to suffer from high noise levels, outliers and data imbalance. This work contributes on the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) methodology to handle temperature data originating from body-mounted and fixed sensors and develop a temperature increase warning mechanism. The main contribution exploits the contextualisation ability of CNN-LSTM to predict temperature changes in windows of 5–120 s. The model identifies the spatial temperature change patterns via a CNN encoder, which are then fed into an LSTM network. This regression mechanism is trained and validated against a set of unique fire spread conditions and involved live tests ranging from containers to residential and industrial units. The model’s performance was evaluated with MAPE sensitivity analysis against data originating from body-mounted sensors and third-party NIST datasets. The outcome showed an error ranging from 0.89 to 2.05% to 5.46% and 6.23%, respectively. The model efficacy was also evaluated against a range of input–output temperature ranges from 5, 30 to 120-s windows and showed a FN rate of 2.15% for pre-alarm-to-normal and 3.11% for alarm-to-pre-alarm cases in body-mounted sensors and a higher FN rate of 5.14% reported for pre-alarm-to-normal case for the raised platfor sensor tests.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06033-3,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Nevertheless, its crucial challenge lies in how to model multiple complicated spatial dependencies between different regions, dynamic temporal laws among different time intervals with external factors such as holidays, events, and weather. Some existing work leverage the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore temporal relations and spatial relations, respectively; which have outperformed the classical statistical methods. However, it is difficult for these approaches to jointly model spatial and temporal correlations. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic deep hybrid spatio-temporal neural network namely DHSTNet, to predict traffic flows in every region of a city with high accuracy. In particular, our DSHTNet model comprises four properties i.e., closeness volume, daily volume, trend volume, and external branch, respectively. Moreover, the projected model dynamically assigns different weights to various branches and, then, integrate outputs of four properties to produce final prediction outcomes. The model has been evaluated, both for offline and online predictions, using an edge/fog infrastructure where training happens on the remote cloud and prediction occurs at the edge i.e. in the proximity of users. Extensive experiments and evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model, in terms of high accuracy over prevailing state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, we apply the exaggeration approach based on an attention mechanism to the above model, called as AAtt-DHSTNet; to predict citywide short-term traffic crowd flows; and show its notable performance in the traffic flows prediction. The aggregation method collects information from the related time series, remove redundancy and, thus, increases prediction speed and accuracy. Our empirical evaluation suggests that the AAtt-DHSTNet model is approximately 20.8% and 8.8% more accurate than the DHSTNet technique, for two different real-world traffic datasets.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-020-10486-4,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Those interfaces can be utilized for simultaneous transmission of a single TCP flow using Multipath TCP (MPTCP). MPTCP is a protocol that is designed to increase end-to-end throughput and reliability of communications by splitting data through multiple parallel paths. Although delay in MPTCP enhanced significantly in the recent years, high number of data transmissions remains an issue. In this paper, we reduce MPTCP delay by reducing the number of transmissions using Opportunistic Routing (OR) technique. OR is a routing model used to increase the delivery rate and reliability of data transmission in wireless networks by using the broadcasting method. This enables each subflow data to be delivered by multiple relays. We adapted OR on a number of MPTCP protocols namely, traditional MPTCP, Multipath TCP Traffic Splitting Control (MPTCP-TSC) and Redundant MPTCP (ReMP TCP) in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The results show that OR-based MPTCP schemes outperform existing schemes. We further compared the OR-based MPTCP protocols in terms of startup delay and energy efficiency.

A large part of these vehicles will be electrically driven and connected to a vehicular network. Rapid advancements in vehicular technology and communications have led to the evolution of vehicular edge computing (VEC). Computation resource allocation is a vehicular network’s primary operations as vehicles have limited onboard computation. Different resource allocation schemes in VEC operate in different environments such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, software defined networks and require specific network performance characteristics for their operations to achieve maximum efficiency. At present, researchers have proposed numerous computation resource allocation schemes which optimize parameters such as power consumption, network stability, quality of service (QoS), etc. These schemes are based on widely used optimization and mathematical models such as the Markov process, Shannon’s law, etc. So, there is a need to present an organized overview of these schemes to help in the future research of the same.

New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS.

Second, we propose seven criteria for how to design and implement EBA procedures successfully.

Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if offline testing results can be used to help reduce the cost of online testing? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is less effective than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.

Moreover, the notion of viewpoint and illumination invariance of VPR techniques has largely been assessed qualitatively and hence ambiguously in the past. In this paper, we address these gaps through a new comprehensive open-source framework for assessing the performance of VPR techniques, dubbed “VPR-Bench”. VPR-Bench (Open-sourced at: https://github.com/MubarizZaffar/VPR-Bench ) introduces two much-needed capabilities for VPR researchers: firstly, it contains a benchmark of 12 fully-integrated datasets and 10 VPR techniques, and secondly, it integrates a comprehensive variation-quantified dataset for quantifying viewpoint and illumination invariance. We apply and analyse popular evaluation metrics for VPR from both the computer vision and robotics communities, and discuss how these different metrics complement and/or replace each other, depending upon the underlying applications and system requirements. Our analysis reveals that no universal SOTA VPR technique exists, since: (a) state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance is achieved by 8 out of the 10 techniques on at least one dataset, (b) SOTA technique in one community does not necessarily yield SOTA performance in the other given the differences in datasets and metrics. Furthermore, we identify key open challenges since: (c) all 10 techniques suffer greatly in perceptually-aliased and less-structured environments, (d) all techniques suffer from viewpoint variance where lateral change has less effect than 3D change, and (e) directional illumination change has more adverse effects on matching confidence than uniform illumination change. We also present detailed meta-analyses regarding the roles of varying ground-truths, platforms, application requirements and technique parameters. Finally, VPR-Bench provides a unified implementation to deploy these VPR techniques, metrics and datasets, and is extensible through templates.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-021-01469-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

They are either not accurate, time-consuming in training or error accumulative. In this paper, we propose a method consisting of two camera pose estimators that deal with the information from pairwise images and a short sequence of images, respectively. For image sequences, a transformer-like structure is adopted to build a geometry model over a local temporal window, referred to as transformer-based auxiliary pose estimator (TAPE). Meanwhile, a flow-to-flow pose estimator (F2FPE) is proposed to exploit the relationship between pairwise images. The two estimators are constrained through a simple yet effective consistency loss in training. Empirical evaluation has shown that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning-based methods by a large margin and performs comparably to supervised and traditional ones on the KITTI and Malaga dataset.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05545-8,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The proposed FS-CNN is used to detect faces on large scale images then analyzing face landmarks to predict expressions for emotion recognition. The FS-CNN is composed form two stages, patch cropping, and convolutional neural networks. The first stage is used to detect faces in high-resolution images and crop the face for further processing. The second stage is a convolutional neural network used to predict facial expression based on landmarks analytics, it was applied on pyramid images to process scale invariance. The proposed FS-CNN was trained and evaluated on the UMD Faces dataset. High performance was achieved with a mean average precision of about 95%.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-10918-9,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Using ML to learn system features is fundamentally different from manually implementing them in conventional components written in source code. In this paper, we make a first step towards exploring the architecture modeling of safety-critical autonomous systems which are composed of conventional components and ML components, based on natural language requirements. Firstly, augmented intelligence for restricted natural language requirement modeling is proposed. In that, several AI technologies such as natural language processing and clustering are used to recommend candidate terms to the glossary, as well as machine learning is used to predict the category of requirements. The glossary including data dictionary and domain glossary and the category of requirements will be used in the restricted natural language requirement specification method RNLReq, which is equipped with a set of restriction rules and templates to structure and restrict the way how users document requirements. Secondly, automatic generation of SysML architecture models from the RNLReq requirement specifications is presented. Thirdly, the prototype tool is implemented based on Papyrus.

It starts with an introduction of Industry 4.0 concept and an understanding of AI use in this context. Then provides elements of security principles and detection techniques applied to operational technology (OT) which forms the main attack surface of manufacturing systems. As some intrusion detection systems (IDS) already involve some AI-based techniques, we focus on existing machine-learning and data-mining based techniques in use for intrusion detection. This article presents the major strengths and weaknesses of the main techniques in use. We also discuss an assessment of their relevance for application to OT, from the manufacturer point of view. Another part of the paper introduces the essential drivers and principles of Industry 4.0, providing insights on the advent of AI in manufacturing systems as well as an understanding of the new set of challenges it implies. AI-based techniques for production monitoring, optimisation and control are proposed with insights on several application cases. The related technical, operational and security challenges are discussed and an understanding of the impact of such transition on current security practices is then provided in more details.

We further present a conceptual model for a simple self-sustaining, self-organizing, self-regulating distributed ‘organism’ as an operationally closed system that would fulfill all basic definitions and criteria for life, and describe developing technologies, particularly artificial neural network (ANN) based artificial intelligence (AI), that would enable it in the near future. Notably, such systems would have a number of specific advantages over biological life, such as the ability to pass acquired traits to offspring, significantly improved speed, accuracy, and redundancy of their genetic carrier, and potentially unlimited lifespans.

This form of ‘somatic surveillance’ (Hayles, Unthought: the power of the cognitive nonconscious. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2017, p. 11) increasingly relies on behavioural biometrics and sensory algorithms to verify the physiology of bodies in cabin interiors. Such processes secure cyber-physical space, but also register user capabilities for control that yield data as insured risk. In this technical re-formation of human–machine interactions for control and communication ‘a dissonance of attribution’ (Hancock et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 116(16):7684, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1805770115 ) is created between perceptions of phenomena, materials and decision-making. This reconfigures relations not only between humans and machines, objects and subjects, but possibly disrupts attributive functions in the social system of Law. What it requires is shifting a legal accountability for action from a sovereignty of the human to a new materialist account based on a ‘cognitive assemblage’ between physiological data, computation and algorithmic sensing. This paper investigates the function of law as a guidance system to acknowledge this account of sensory and algorithmic computation as autonomous ‘sensing agents’ (Hansen, Feed-forward: on the future of twenty-first-century media. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2015) that may be accountable in situations of risk. This assemblage of robotic computation and sensory determination requires a clearer legal differentiation across the current static terminologies of person, property, liability and rights that maintain strict separations of object from subject.

A key challenge is that robotic platforms and their operations are typically constrained in ways that limit their energy, time, or travel distance, which in turn limits the number of measurements that can be collected. Therefore, paths need to be planned to maximize the information gathered about an unknown environment while satisfying the given budget constraint, which is known as the informative planning problem. This review discusses the literature dedicated to information-driven path planning, introducing the key algorithmic building blocks as well as the outstanding challenges. Recent Findings Machine learning approaches have been introduced to solve the information-driven path planning problem, improving both efficiency and robustness.

Therefore, this article will outline several key approaches to assessing communication, associated data requirements, example applications, verification of methods through HAT use cases, and lessons learned, where applicable. Some approaches are based on the structure of team communication; others draw from dynamical systems theory to consider perspectives across different timescales; other approaches leverage features of team members’ voices or facial expressions to detect emotional states that can provide windows into other workings of the team; still others consider the content of communication to produce insights. Taken together, these approaches comprise a varied toolkit for deriving critical information about how team interactions affect, and are affected by, coordination, trust, cohesion, and performance outcomes.

In this report, we review recent algorithmic development in making multi-robot systems robust to environmental uncertainties, failures, and adversarial attacks. Recent Findings We find the following three trends in the recent research in the area of multi-robot coordination: (1) resilient coordination to either withstand failures and/or attack or recover from failures/attacks; (2) risk-aware coordination to manage the trade-off risk and reward, where the risk stems due to environmental uncertainty; (3) Graph neural networks based coordination to learn decentralized multi-robot coordination policies. These algorithms have been applied to tasks such as formation control, task assignment and scheduling, search and planning, and informative data collection. Summary In order for multi-robot systems to become practical, we need coordination algorithms that can scale to large teams of robots dealing with dynamically changing, failure-prone, contested, and uncertain environments. There has been significant recent research on multi-robot coordination that has contributed resilient and risk-aware algorithms to deal with these issues and reduce the gap between theory and practice. Learning-based approaches have been seen to be promising, especially since they can learn who, when, and how to communicate for effective coordination. However, these algorithms have also been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and as such developing learning-based coordination strategies that are resilient to such attacks and robust to uncertainties is an important open area of research.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43154-021-00046-5,springer,autonomous vehicle,'autonomous vehicle' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
