Although of low complexity the resulting network achieves a high level of accuracy in iris region segmentation for challenging off-axis eye-patches. Interestingly, this network is also shown to achieve high levels of performance for regular, frontal, segmentation of iris regions, comparing favourably with state-of-the-art techniques of significantly higher complexity. Due to its lower complexity this network is well suited for deployment in embedded applications such as augmented and mixed reality headsets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

350944360,2020-10-01T00:00:00,"This study describes the development of a simple and easy-to-build portable automated bag valve mask (BVM) compression system, which, during acute shortages and supply chain disruptions can serve as a temporary emergency ventilator. The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.Peer reviewe","[{'title': 'HardwareX', 'identifiers': ['issn:2468-0672', '2468-0672']}]",'Elsevier BV',Partially RepRapable automated open source bag valve mask-based ventilator,10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00131,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237183624,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Parking vehicle is a daunting task and a common problem in many cities around the globe. The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces and IoU value is used to identify vehicle occupancy information",,'Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)',Deep learning-based vehicle occupancy detection in an open parking lot using thermal camera,10.1049/iet-its.2019.0468,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
322738580,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An important research problem in artificial intelligence is how to organize multiple agents, and coordinate them, so that they can work together to solve problems. Coordinating agents in a multi-agent system can significantly affect the systems performance-the agents can, in many instances, be organized so that they can solve tasks more efficiently, and consequently benefit collectively and individually. Central to this endeavor is coalition formation-the process by which heterogeneous agents organize and form disjoint groups (coalitions). Coalition formation often involves finding a coalition structure (an exhaustive set of disjoint coalitions) that maximizes the systems potential performance (e.g., social welfare) through coalition structure generation. However, coalition structure generation typically has no notion of goals. In cooperative settings, where coordination of multiple coalitions is important, this may generate suboptimal teams for achieving and accomplishing the tasks and goals at hand. With this in mind, we consider simultaneously generating coalitions of agents and assigning the coalitions to independent alternatives (e.g., tasks/goals), and present an anytime algorithm for the simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment problem. This combinatorial optimization problem hasmany real-world applications, including forming goal-oriented teams. To evaluate the presented algorithms performance, we present five methods for synthetic problem set generation, and benchmark the algorithm against the industry-grade solver CPLEXusing randomized data sets of varying distribution and complexity. To test its anytime-performance, we compare the quality of its interim solutions against those generated by a greedy algorithm and pure random search. Finally, we also apply the algorithm to solve the problem of assigning agents to regions in a major commercial strategy game, and show that it can be used in game-playing to coordinate smaller sets of agents in real-time.Funding Agencies|Linkoping University; Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An anytime algorithm for optimal simultaneous coalition structure generation and assignment,10.1007/s10458-020-09450-1,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482629844,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Illegal logging and trafficking of endangered timber species has attracted the world's major organized crime groups, with associated deforestation and serious social damage. The inability of traditional methodologies and DNA analysis to readily perform wood identification to the species level for monitoring has stimulated research on chemotyping techniques. In this study, simple wood extraction of endangered rosewoods (Dalbergia spp), amenable to use in the field, produced colorful hues that were suggestive of wood species. A more definitive study was conducted to develop wood species identification procedures using high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometers interfaced with liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). The time consuming process of extracting “identifying” mass spectral ions for species identification, contentious due to their ubiquitous nature, was supplanted by application of machine learning processes. The unbiased software mining of raw data from multiple analytical batches, followed by statistical Random Forest analysis, enabled discrimination between both anatomically and chemotypically similar Dalbergia species. Statistical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scatterplots with 95% confidence ellipses were visually compelling in showing a differential clustering of Dalbergia from other commonly traded and lookalike wood species.

Also, a very significant element in teaching is teacher motivation that is the trigger that pushes the teachers forward, depending on some internal and external factors. In the current study, seven research questions were designed to explore different aspects of teacher motivation, and they were analyzed via SPSS. The current study also compared the results by using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Due to the similarity of ANFIS to humans' brain intelligence, the results of the current study could be similar to humans regarding what happens in reality. To do so, the researchers used the validated teacher motivation scale (TMS) and asked participants to fill the questionnaire, and analyzed the results. When the inputs were added to the ANFIS system, the model indicated a high accuracy and prediction capability.

389904876,2020-07-09T00:00:00,"The article presents a new concept of “Management of knowledge about virtual promotion” on the Internet. Usually a real produ ct or service is being divided into four components (product, price, promotion and place) in accordance with the theory of marketing. One of the components is a product promotion. But now this element is becoming a fully virtual tool. It is necessary to consider product promotion as an image or a copy of a real product in a virtual space that lives in parallel on the network. Therefore, the objective of the paper is the presentation of a new object of research based on the experience of more than thirty real projects performed in Ukraine, USA, Europe and Canada. We regard the promotion as a software product, which works according to principles of knowledge management and machine learning. It is proposed that virtual promotion is characterized by four views: customer or user, data, technology and marketing. Thus, the structure of virtual promotion business process was presented. It includes four steps: selection of hypertext sources, knowledge representation and extraction, semantic kernel building and quality criterion evaluation to stop the process. Based on the process structure the research tasks were identified. The central task is semantic kernel forming. Then the software architecture was developed. IT solution contains CRM system as accounting tool and Web site as an image of virtual promotion. CRM plays main role as a commander center. Here we form semantic kernel and then send it via marketing channels such as Web site, telegram or viber accounts. Another part of IT solution is Web service such as Bing API or Google API. They help us to build the kernel.

333569035,2020,"Integrated clinical pathways (ICPs) are task-oriented care plans detailing the essential steps of the therapeutic pathway referring to a specific clinical problem with a patient’s expected clinical course. ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient’s health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches",,'MDPI AG',Design and Execution of Integrated Clinical Pathway: A Simplified Meta-Model and Associated Methodology,10.3390/info11070362,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The paper “A Technologically Agnostic Framework for Cyber-Physical and IoT Processing-in-Memory-based Systems Simulation”, by Santos et al., aims to focus on Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a solution for efficiently processing big data. In particular, this work presents a framework to simulate and automatically generate code for IoT PIM-based systems. Moreover, it proposes an high speed and energy efficient architecture for an IoT PIM system, able to compute a real image recognition application.



The paper “Recommender system implementations for embedded collaborative filtering applications”, by Pajuelo-Holguera et al., aims to propose a complete recommender system implemented on reconfigurable hardware with the purpose of testing on-chip, low-energy embedded collaborative filtering applications. The proposed approach solves any prediction problem based on collaborative filtering by using an off-line, highly-portable light computing environment. Moreover, this work exploits a custom, fine-grained parallel circuit for quick matrix multiplication with floating-point numbers.



The paper “SystemC-based Electronic System-Level Design Space Exploration Environment for Dedicated Heterogeneous Multi-Processor Systems”, by Pomante et al., faces the problem of the Electronic System-Level (ESL) HW/SW co-design of dedicated electronic digital systems based on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures. In particular, the work presents a prototype SystemC -based environment that exploits a Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach able to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the system specification and a mapping onto an automatically defined architecture.



The paper “A Fast and Scalable Architecture to Run Convolutional Neural Networks in Low Density FPGAs”, by Véstias et al., deals with efficient configurable architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) inference targeting any density FPGAs. The architecture exploits fixed-point arithmetic and image batch to reduce computational, memory and memory bandwidth requirements without compromising network accuracy.

288570501,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm – II, and ~23–29% improvement is observed in the uncertain objective function. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ~10–95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",,'Elsevier BV',Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper presents an intelligent system capable of deciding which countermeasures to take in order to mitigate an intrusion in a software defined network. The interaction between the intruder and the defender is posed as a Markov game and MuZero algorithm is used to train the model through self-play. Once trained, the model is integrated with an SDN controller, so that it is able to apply the countermeasures of the game in a real network. To measure the performance of the model, attackers and defenders with different training steps have been confronted and the scores obtained by each of them, the duration of the games and the ratio of games won have been collected.

491003696,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Since 2017, we have used IonTorrent NGS platform in our hospital to diagnose and treat cancer. Analyzing variants at each run requires considerable time, and we are still struggling with some variants that appear correct on the metrics at first, but are found to be negative upon further investigation. Can any machine learning algorithm (ML) help us classify NGS variants? This has led us to investigate which ML can fit our NGS data and to develop a tool that can be routinely implemented to help biologists. Currently, one of the greatest challenges in medicine is processing a significant quantity of data. This is particularly true in molecular biology with the advantage of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for profiling and identifying molecular tumors and their treatment. In addition to bioinformatics pipelines, artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable in helping to analyze mutation variants. Generating sequencing data from patient DNA samples has become easy to perform in clinical trials. However, analyzing the massive quantities of genomic or transcriptomic data and extracting the key biomarkers associated with a clinical response to a specific therapy requires a formidable combination of scientific expertise, biomolecular skills and a panel of bioinformatic and biostatistic tools, in which artificial intelligence is now successful in developing future routine diagnostics. However, cancer genome complexity and technical artifacts make identifying real variants challenging. We present a machine learning method for classifying pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs), insertions, and deletions detected by NGS from different types of tumor specimens, such as: colorectal, melanoma, lung and glioma cancer. We compared our NGS data to different machine learning algorithms using the k-fold cross-validation method and to neural networks (deep learning) to measure the performance of the different ML algorithms and determine which one is a valid model for confirming NGS variant calls in cancer diagnosis. We trained our machine learning with 70% of our data samples, extracted from our local database (our data structure had 7 parameters: chromosome, position, exon, variant allele frequency, minor allele frequency, coverage and protein description) and validated it with the 30% remaining data. The model offering the best accuracy was chosen and implemented in the NGS analysis routine. Artificial intelligence was developed with the R script language version 3.6.0. We trained our model on 70% of 102,011 variants. Our best error rate (0.22%) was found with random forest machine learning (ntree = 500 and mtry = 4), with an AUC of 0.99. Neural networks achieved some good scores. The final trained model with the neural network achieved an accuracy of 98% and an ROC-AUC of 0.99 with validation data. We tested our RF model to interpret more than 2000 variants from our NGS database: 20 variants were misclassified (error rate < 1%). The errors were nomenclature problems and false positives. After adding false positives to our training database and implementing our RF model routinely, our error rate was always < 0.5%. The RF model shows excellent results for oncosomatic NGS interpretation and can easily be implemented in other molecular biology laboratories. AI is becoming increasingly important in molecular biomedical analysis and can be very helpful in processing medical data.

The capability of correctly detecting whether a user?s utterance has ended or not improves the accuracy in interpreting the meaning of the message and decreases the latency in the answer. Usually, in dialogue systems, an EOTD-M is coupled with an Automatic Speech Recognition Module (ASR-M) to transmit complete utterances to the Natural Language Understanding unit. Mistakes in the ASR-M transcription can have a strong effect on the performance of the EOTD-M. The actual extent of this effect depends on the particular combination of ASR M transcription errors and the sentence featurization techniques implemented as part of the EOTD-M. In this paper we investigate this important relationship for an EOTD-M based on semantic information and particular characteristics of the speakers (speech profiles). We introduce an Automatic Speech Recognition Simulator (ASR-SIM) that models different types of semantic mistakes in the ASR-M transcription as well as different speech profiles. We use the simulator to evaluate the sensitivity to ASR-M mistakes of a Long Short-Term Memory network classifier trained in EOTD with different featurization techniques. Our experiments reveal the different ways in which the performance of the model is influenced by the ASR-M errors. We corroborate that not only is the ASR-SIM useful to estimate the performance of an EOTD-M in customized noisy scenarios, but it can also be used to generate training datasets with the expected error rates of real working conditions, which leads to better performance.The research presented in this paper has been conducted as part of the project EMPATHIC that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 769872.

480201885,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The increasing digitalization and advancement in information communication technologies has greatly changed how humans interact with digital information. Nowadays, it is not sufficient to only display relevant data in production activities, as the enormous amount of data generated from smart devices can overwhelm operators without being fully utilized. Operators often require extensive knowledge of the machines in use to make informed decisions during processes such as maintenance and production. To enable novice operators to access such knowledge, it is important to reinvent the way of interacting with digitally enhanced smart devices. In this research, a mobile augmented reality remote monitoring system is proposed to help operators with low knowledge and experience level comprehend digital twin data of a device and interact with the device. It analyses both historic logs as well as real-time data through a cloud server and enriches 2D data with 3D models and animations in the 3D physical space. A cloud-based machine learning algorithm is applied to transform learned knowledge into live presentations on a mobile device for users to interact with. A scaled-down case study is conducted using a tower crane model to demonstrate the potential benefits as well as implications when the system is deployed in industrial environments. This user study verifies that the proposed solution yields consistent measurable improvements for novice users in human-device interaction that is statistically significant","[{'title': 'Computers', 'identifiers': ['issn:2073-431X', '2073-431x']}]",'MDPI AG',An Integrated Mobile Augmented Reality Digital Twin Monitoring System,10.3390/computers10080099,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480206406,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The challenges proposed by the HL-LHC era are not limited to the sheer amount of data to be processed: the capability of optimizing the analyser's experience will also bring important benefits for the LHC communities, in terms of total resource needs, user satisfaction and in the reduction of end time to publication. At the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) a portable software stack for analysis has been proposed, based on cloud-native tools and capable of providing users with a fully integrated analysis environment for the CMS experiment. The main characterizing traits of the solution consist in the user-driven design and the portability to any cloud resource provider. All this is made possible via an evolution towards a “python-based” framework, that enables the usage of a set of open-source technologies largely adopted in both cloud-native and data-science environments. In addition, a “single sign on”-like experience is available thanks to the standards-based integration of INDIGO-IAM with all the tools. The integration of compute resources is done through the customization of a JupyterHUB solution, able to spawn identity-aware user instances ready to access data with no further setup actions. The integration with GPU resources is also available, designed to sustain more and more widespread ML based workflow. Seamless connections between the user UI and batch/big data processing framework (Spark, HTCondor) are possible. Eventually, the experiment data access latency is reduced thanks to the integrated deployment of a scalable set of caches, as developed in the context of ESCAPE project, and as such compatible with the future scenarios where a data-lake will be available for the research community.
The outcome of the evaluation of such a solution in action is presented, showing how a real CMS analysis workflow can make use of the infrastructure to achieve its results","[{'title': 'EPJ Web of Conferences', 'identifiers': ['2100-014x', 'issn:2100-014X']}]",'EDP Sciences',First experiences with a portable analysis infrastructure for LHC at INFN,10.1051/epjconf/202125102045,https://core.ac.uk/download/480206406.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
401914974,2021-03-29T00:00:00,"Purpose: This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on the Visual Arts industry in Malaysia. In general, this pandemic has affected various forms of artistic activities and the income of visual arts artists and galleries. The cancellation of art projects and exhibitions has greatly affected the artist's source of income as well as disrupted the sale of works and forms of art appreciation. The crisis has also opened up a new form to the visual arts industry by looking at alternative approaches to the continuity of the arts field by switching to virtual or online methods. This emerging crisis of COVID-19 might be the starting point for all art practitioners including artists, art critics, galleries/museums, collectors, and curators in using the online space to continue to capitalize on and expand the Visual Arts industry.
Design/methodology/approach: Review approach.
Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on the country's Visual Arts industry where a wide range of art activities cannot be implemented and opened up opportunities for online activities
Practical implications: Exhibition and sale of works through online approach has become one of the main methods that support the Visual Arts industry with the application of a combination of the latest technologies such as VR and AI that enable the representation of real experiences in the context of art appreciation.
Originality/value: This paper is original.

524551330,2022-03-04T00:00:00,"The aim of this study was to investigate and assess parents' and teachers' views of the home-visiting program as a method of early childhood education during the COVID-19 outbreak. Exploratory qualitative research employed as methods of inquiry. Twelve resource persons were interviewed (3 teachers and 9 parents). The data revealed, parents and teachers perceive that using home visits has a number of benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are as follows: 1) more effective than online; 2) make learning materials easy for children to understand; 3) pique children's interest and excitement for learning; and 4) eliminate the need for parents to assist their children with their tasks. Meanwhile, the downsides include the following: 1) it was inconvenient for parents because they were needed to entertain teachers and other children; 2) some pupils couldn't study because home visits were far away from their homes.; 3) additional media and learning activities preparation; 4) additional time and energy was wasted; and 5) the risk of exposure to COVID-19 was increased. The researchers recommend that additional study be conducted with a larger and more diverse sample size in order to obtain a more complete picture of this issue.

The exploration and practices (design, implementation, modification) of social technologies mean the work with the widest possible range of social phenomena, deploying on very different spatial and time scales and in various social spheres. At the same time, there remains a need for conceptual and theoretical clarification of “social technologies” on the other hand, and for their institualization as research and practical fields (with its own standards, human and organizational resources and so on).

Seed sorting based on machine vision provides an effective solution to this problem. The deep learning technology, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have exhibited impressive performance in image recognition and classification, and have been proven applicable in seed sorting. However the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in real-time applications, especially on devices with limited resources. In this study, a rapid and highly efficient lightweight CNN based on visual attention, namely SeedSortNet, is proposed for seed sorting. First, a dual-branch lightweight feature extraction module Shield-block is elaborately designed by performing identity mapping, spatial transformation at higher dimensions and different receptive field modeling, and thus it can alleviate information loss and effectively characterize the multi-scale feature while utilizing fewer parameters and lower computational complexity. In the down-sampling layer, the traditional MaxPool is replaced as MaxBlurPool to improve the shift-invariant of the network. Also, an extremely lightweight sub-feature space attention module (SFSAM) is presented to selectively emphasize fine-grained features and suppress the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that SeedSortNet achieves the accuracy rates of 97.33% and 99.56% on the maize seed dataset and sunflower seed dataset, respectively, and outperforms the mainstream lightweight networks (MobileNetv2, ShuffleNetv2, etc.) at similar computational costs, with only 0.400M parameters (vs. 4.06M, 5.40M)","[{'title': 'PeerJ Computer Science', 'identifiers': ['2376-5992', 'issn:2376-5992']}]",'PeerJ',SeedSortNet: a rapid and highly effificient lightweight CNN based on visual attention for seed sorting,10.7717/peerj-cs.639,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The framework is tailored to be computationally lightweight, as well as entertaining and visually appealing through collaboration with designers and animators. The fundamental gesture recognition pipeline employs a Leap motion device and two separate machine learning architectures to evaluate kinematic hand data on-the-fly. The first architecture is used to recognize and segment human motion activity in order to initialize the RPS play, and the second architecture is used to classify hand gestures into rock, paper or scissors. The employed tabletop robot interacts in the RPS play through unique animated gestural movements and vocalizations designed by animators which communicate the robot's choices as well as cognitive reflection on winning, losing and draw states. Performance of both learning architectures is carefully evaluated with respect to accuracy, reliability and run time performance under different feature and classifier types.

This work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test data. We focused on obtaining a clinically useful tool that could be successfully integrated into a hospital workflow. Materials and methods: Based on expert opinion, we selected four target chest x-ray findings, namely lung opacities, fractures, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. For each finding we defined the most suitable type of ground-truth label, and built four training datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our institutional archive. We trained four different Deep Learning architectures and combined their outputs with a late fusion strategy, obtaining a unified tool. The performance was measured on two test datasets: an external openly-available dataset, and a retrospective institutional dataset, to estimate performance on the local population. Results: The external and local test sets had 4376 and 1064 images, respectively, for which the model showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.74–0.76) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.86–0.89) in the detection of abnormal chest x-rays. For the local population, a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI: 84–90), and a specificity of 88% (95%CI: 86–90) were obtained, with no significant differences between demographic subgroups. We present examples of heatmaps to show the accomplished level of interpretability, examining true and false positives. Conclusion: This study presents a new approach for exploiting heterogeneous labels from different chest x-ray datasets, by choosing Deep Learning architectures according to the radiological characteristics of each pathological finding. We estimated the tool's performance on the local population, obtaining results comparable to state-of-the-art metrics. We believe this approach is closer to the actual reading process of chest x-rays by professionals, and therefore more likely to be successful in a real clinical setting.Fil: Mosquera, Candelaria..

La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012).

Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them.

479360462,2021-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction. An important part of an automotive unmanned vehicle (UV) control system is the environment analysis module. This module is based on various types of sensors, e.g. video cameras, lidars and radars. The development of computer and video technologies makes it possible to implement an environment analysis module using a single video camera as a sensor. This approach is expected to reduce the cost of the entire module. The main task in video image processing is to analyse the environment as a 3D scene. The 3D trajectory of an object, which takes into account its dimensions, angle of view and movement vector, as well as the vehicle pose in a video image, provides sufficient information for assessing the real interaction of objects. A basis for constructing a 3D trajectory is vehicle pose estimation.Aim. To develop an automatic method for estimating vehicle pose based on video data analysis from a single video camera.Materials and methods. An automatic method for vehicle pose estimation from a video image was proposed based on a cascade approach. The method includes vehicle detection, key points determination, segmentation and vehicle pose estimation. Vehicle detection and determination of its key points were resolved via a neural network. The segmentation of a vehicle video image and its mask preparation were implemented by transforming it into a polar coordinate system and searching for the outer contour using graph theory.Results. The estimation of vehicle pose was implemented by matching the Fourier image of vehicle mask signatures and the templates obtained based on 3D models. The correctness of the obtained vehicle pose and angle of view estimation was confirmed by experiments based on the proposed method. The vehicle pose estimation had an accuracy of 89 % on an open Carvana image dataset.Conclusion. A new approach for vehicle pose estimation was proposed, involving the transition from end-to-end learning of neural networks to resolve several problems at once, e.g., localization, classification, segmentation, and angle of view, towards cascade analysis of information. The accuracy level of end-to-end learning requires large sets of representative data, which complicates the scalability of solutions for road environments in Russia. The proposed method makes it possible to estimate the vehicle pose with a high accuracy level, at the same time as involving no large costs for manual data annotation and training","[{'title': 'Journal of the Russian Universities Radioelectronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1993-8985', '1993-8985', 'issn:2658-4794', '2658-4794']}]",'St. Petersburg Electrotechnical University LETI',Method for Automatic Determination of a 3D Trajectory of Vehicles in a Video Image,10.32603/1993-8985-2021-24-3-49-59,https://core.ac.uk/download/479360462.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation.

Although of low complexity the resulting network achieves a high level of accuracy in iris region segmentation for challenging off-axis eye-patches. Interestingly, this network is also shown to achieve high levels of performance for regular, frontal, segmentation of iris regions, comparing favourably with state-of-the-art techniques of significantly higher complexity. Due to its lower complexity this network is well suited for deployment in embedded applications such as augmented and mixed reality headsets. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of information is huge, and it is often difficult to distinguish normal news and comments from unreliable information. In this regard, the issue of detecting fake news and countering its spread becomes urgent. This task is not trivial for the following reasons: firstly, the volume of content that is created every day on the Internet is enormous; secondly, the detection system requires news plots that are obviously true; thirdly, the system must be able to analyze information in close to real time. The article presents a new approach to detecting the spread of false information on the Internet based on the use of data science algorithms. The concept of a fake news detection system includes 4 components and a data storage system.

While SAR research has recently experienced prolific growth, long-term trust, clinical translation and patient benefit remain immature. Affective human-robot interactions are unresolved and the deployment of robots with conversational abilities is fundamental for robustness and humanrobot engagement. In this paper, we review the state of the art within the past two decades, design trends, and current applications of conversational affective SAR for ageing and dementia support. A horizon scanning of AI voice technology for healthcare, including ubiquitous smart speakers, is further introduced to address current gaps inhibiting home use. We discuss the role of user-centred approaches in the design of voice systems, including the capacity to handle communication breakdowns for effective use by target populations. We summarise the state of development in interactions using speech and natural language processing, which forms a baseline for longitudinal health monitoring and cognitive assessment.

478762459,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Big data technology has been developed rapidly in recent years. The performance improvement mechanism of targeted poverty alleviation is studied through the big data technology to further promote the comprehensive application of big data technology in poverty alleviation and development. Using the data mining knowledge to accurately identify the poor population under the framework of big data, compared with the traditional identification method, it is obviously more accurate and persuasive, which is also helpful to find out the real causes of poverty and assist the poor residents in the future. In the current targeted poverty alleviation work, the identification of poor households and the matching of assistance measures are mainly through the visiting of village cadres and the establishment of documents. Traditional methods are time-consuming, laborious, and difficult to manage. It always omits lots of useful family information. Therefore, new technologies need to be introduced to realize intelligent identification of poverty-stricken households and reduce labor costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel DBSCAN clustering algorithm via the edge computing-based deep neural network model for targeted poverty alleviation. First, we deploy an edge computing-based deep neural network model. Then, in this constructed model, we execute data mining for the poverty-stricken family. In this paper, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to excavate the poverty features of the poor households and complete the intelligent identification of the poor households. In view of the current situation of high-dimensional and large-volume poverty alleviation data, the algorithm uses the relative density difference of grid to divide the data space into regions with different densities and adopts the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the above result, which improves the accuracy of DBSCAN. This avoids the need for DBSCAN to traverse all data when searching for density connections. Finally, the proposed method is utilized for analyzing and mining the poverty alleviation data. The average accuracy is more than 96%. The average F-measure, NMI, and PRE values exceed 90%. The results show that it provides decision support for precise matching and intelligent pairing of village cadres in poverty alleviation work","[{'title': 'Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing', 'identifiers': ['1530-8677', 'issn:1530-8677']}]",'Hindawi Limited',A Novel DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm via Edge Computing-Based Deep Neural Network Model for Targeted Poverty Alleviation Big Data,10.1155/2021/5536579,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480201299,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They are trained in a batch learning mode; hence, the whole training data should be ready before the training task. However, this is not applicable for many real-time applications where data arrive sequentially such as online topic-detection in social communities, traffic flow prediction, etc. In this paper, an efficient hardware implementation of a low-latency online neural network system is proposed for a traffic flow prediction application. The proposed model is implemented with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict the traffic flow with high accuracy where the Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) model achieves the least mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.001. The proposed system is implemented using floating point and fixed point arithmetics on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the ZedBoard. The implementation is provided using BRAM architecture and distributed memory in FPGA in order to achieve the best trade-off between latency, the consumption of area, and power. Using the fixed point approach, the prediction times using the distributed memory and BRAM architectures are 150 ns and 420 ns, respectively. The area delay product (ADP) of the proposed system is reduced by 17 × compared with the hardware implementation of the latest proposed system in the literature. The execution time of the proposed hardware system is improved by 200 × compared with the software implemented on a dual core Intel i7-7500U CPU at 2.9 GHz.

480278110,2021-12-01T00:00:00,"Among the wide variety of malicious behavior commonly observed in modern social platforms, one of the most notorious is the diffusion of fake news, given its potential to influence the opinions of millions of people who can be voters, consumers, or simply citizens going about their daily lives. In this paper, we implement and carry out an empirical evaluation of a version of the recently-proposed NetDER architecture for hybrid AI decision-support systems with the capability of leveraging the availability of machine learning modules, logical reasoning about unknown objects, and forecasts based on diffusion processes. NetDER is a general architecture for reasoning about different kinds of malicious behavior such as dissemination of fake news, hate speech, and malware, detection of botnet operations, prevention of cyber attacks including those targeting software products or blockchain transactions, among others. Here, we focus on the case of fake news dissemination on social platforms by three different kinds of users: non-malicious, malicious, and botnet members. In particular, we focus on three tasks: (i) determining who is responsible for posting a fake news article, (ii) detecting malicious users, and (iii) detecting which users belong to a botnet designed to disseminate fake news. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate data with ground truth, we also develop a testbed that combines real-world fake news datasets with synthetically generated networks of users and fully-detailed traces of their behavior throughout a series of time points. We designed our testbed to be customizable for different problem sizes and settings, and make its code publicly available to be used in similar evaluation efforts. Finally, we report on the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of three variants of our model and six environmental settings over the three tasks. Our results clearly show the effects that the quality of knowledge engineering tasks, the quality of the underlying machine learning classifier used to detect fake news, and the specific environmental conditions have on smart policing efforts in social platforms.Fil: Paredes, José Nicolás.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation.

In the research, the camera was used in combination with the software for development, and the real-time image processing technology was used to obtain the information of the color of the food, and through calculation parameters, the cooking status of the food was monitored. In the second year, using the color space conversion, a novel algorithm, and artificial intelligence, the foreground segmentation was used to separate the vegetables from the background, and the cooking ripeness, cooking unevenness, oil glossiness, and sauce absorption were calculated. The image color difference and the distribution were used to judge the cooking conditions of the food, so that the cooking system can identify whether or not to adopt partial tumbling, or to end a cooking operation.

387260665,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

323141626,2020-01-01T08:00:00,"2020 Elsevier Ltd Smart cities are conceptualized as a vehicle for sustainable urban development and a means to deliver high quality of life for residents. One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring",,'Sociological Research Online',A sentiment reporting framework for major city events: Case study on the China-United States trade war,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In a machine learning perspective, Customer Value Management departments require automated methods and processes to create marketing campaigns able to identify the most appropriate churn prevention approach. Moving towards a big data-driven environment, a deeper understanding of data provided by churn processes and client operations is needed. In this context, a procedure aiming at reducing the number of churners by planning a customized marketing campaign is deployed through a data-driven approach. Decision Tree methodology is applied to drow up a list of clients with churn propensity: in this way, customer analysis is detailed, as well as the development of a marketing campaign, integrating the individual churn model with viral churn perspective. The first step of the proposed procedure requires the evaluation of churn probability for each customer, based on the influence of his social links. Then, the customer profiling is performed considering (a) individual variables, (b) variables describing customer-company interactions, (c) external variables. The main contribution of this work is the development of a versatile procedure for viral churn prevention, applying Decision Tree techniques in the telecommunication sector, and integrating a direct campaign from the Customer Value Management marketing department to each customer with significant churn risk.

In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

481284576,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Conventional computing systems are limited in performance by the well-known von Neumann bottleneck, arising from the physical separation of processor and memory units. The use of electrical signals in such systems also limits computing speeds and introduces significant energy losses. There is thus a pressing need for unconventional computing approaches, ones that can exploit the high bandwidths/speeds and low losses intrinsic to photonics. A promising platform for such a purpose is that offered by integrated phase-change photonics. Here, chalcogenide phase-change materials are incorporated into standard integrated photonics devices to deliver wide-ranging computational functionality, including non-volatile memory and fast, low-energy arithmetic and neuromorphic processing. We report the development of a compact behavioral model for integrated phase change photonic devices, one which is fast enough to allow system level simulations to be run in a reasonable timescale with basic computing resources, while also being accurate enough to capture the key operating characteristics of real devices. Moreover, our model is readily incorporated with commercially available simulation software for photonic integrated circuits, thereby enabling the design, simulation and optimization of large-scale phase-change photonics systems. We demonstrate such capabilities by exploring the optimization and simulation of the operating characteristics of two important phase-change photonic systems recently reported, namely a spiking neural network system and a matrix-vector photonic crossbar array (photonic tensor core). Results show that use of our behavioral model can significantly facilitate the design and optimization at the system level, as well as expediting exploration of the capabilities of novel phase-change computing architectures",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',System-level simulation for integrated phase-change photonics,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

523156438,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The adoption of fast-paced practices for developing virtual network functions (VNFs) allows for continuous software delivery and creates a market advantage for network operators. This adoption, however, is problematic for testing engineers that need to assure, in shorter development cycles, certain quality of highly-configurable product releases running on heterogeneous clouds. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate testing workflows by detecting performance issues in new software builds. However, the overhead of maintaining several models for all combinations of build types, network configurations, and other stack parameters, can quickly become prohibitive and make the application of ML infeasible.



We propose Env2Vec, a deep learning architecture that combines contextual features with historical resource usage, and characterizes the various stack parameters that influence the test execution within an embedding space, which allows it to generalize model predictions to previously unseen environments. We integrate a single ML model in the testing workflow to automatically debug errors and pinpoint performance bottlenecks.

288570495,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, and ∼23 – 29% improvement is observed in the objective functions. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ∼10 – 95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",,'Elsevier BV',Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
483447297,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"The EO-ALERT European Commission H2020 project proposes the definition, development, and verification and

validation through ground hardware testing, of a next-generation Earth Observation (EO) data processing chain. The

proposed data processing chain is based on a novel flight segment architecture that moves EO data processing

elements traditionally executed in the ground segment to on-board the satellite, with the aim of delivering EO

products to the end user with very low latency. EO-ALERT achieves, globally, latencies below five minutes for EO

products delivery, and below one minute in realistic scenarios.

The proposed EO-ALERT architecture is enabled by on-board processing, recent improvements in processing

hardware using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, and persistent space-to-ground communications

links. EO-ALERT combines innovations in the on-board elements of the data chain and the communications,

namely: on-board reconfigurable data handling, on-board image generation and processing for the generation of

alerts (EO products) using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), on-board AI-based compression and encryption, high-speed on-board avionics, and reconfigurable high data rate communication links

to ground, including a separate chain for alerts with minimum latency and global coverage.

This paper presents the proposed architecture, its hardware realization for the ground testing in a representative

environment and its performance. The architecture’s performance is evaluated considering two different user

scenarios where very low latency (almost-real-time) EO product delivery is required: ship detection and extreme

weather monitoring/nowcasting. The hardware testing results show that, when implemented using COTS

components and available communication links, the proposed architecture can deliver alerts to the end user with a

latency below five minutes, for both SAR and Optical missions, demonstrating the viability of the EO-ALERT

architecture. In particular, in several test scenarios, for both the TerraSAR-X SAR and DEIMOS-2 Optical Very

High Resolution (VHR) missions, hardware testing of the proposed architecture has shown it can deliver EO

products and alerts to the end user globally, with latency lower than one-point-five minutes",,,A Novel Architecture for the Next Generation of Earth Observation Satellites Supporting Rapid Civil Alert,,https://core.ac.uk/download/483447297.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

477671455,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"This research is concerned with the novel application and investigation of ‘Soft Actor Critic’ based deep reinforcement learning to control the cooling setpoint (and hence cooling loads) of a large commercial building to harness energy flexibility. The research is motivated by the challenge associated with the development and application of conventional model-based control approaches at scale to the wider building stock. Soft Actor Critic is a model-free deep reinforcement learning technique that is able to handle continuous action spaces and which has seen limited application to real-life or high-fidelity simulation implementations in the context of automated and intelligent control of building energy systems. Such control techniques are seen as one possible solution to supporting the operation of a smart, sustainable and future electrical grid. This research tests the suitability of the technique through training and deployment of the agent on an EnergyPlus based environment of the office building. The agent was found to learn an optimal control policy that was able to minimise energy costs by 9.7% compared to the default rule-based control scheme and was able to improve or maintain thermal comfort limits over a test period of one week. The algorithm was shown to be robust to the different hyperparameters and this optimal control policy was learnt through the use of a minimal state space consisting of readily available variables. The robustness of the algorithm was tested through investigation of the speed of learning and ability to deploy to different seasons and climates. It was found that the agent requires minimal training sample points and outperforms the baseline after three months of operation and also without disruption to thermal comfort during this period. The agent is transferable to other climates and seasons although further retraining or hyperparameter tuning is recommended","[{'title': 'Energy and AI', 'identifiers': ['issn:2666-5468', '2666-5468']}]",'Elsevier BV',Development of a Soft Actor Critic deep reinforcement learning approach for harnessing energy flexibility in a Large Office building,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100101,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Although a thorough and consistent benchmarking procedure can allow us to estimate the expected operational abilities of the underlying deep model, this topic remains under-researched. This paper tackles this issue and presents an end-to-end benchmarking approach for quantifying the abilities of deep learning algorithms in virtually any kind of on-board space applications. The experimental validation, performed over several state-of-the-art deep models and benchmark datasets, showed that different deep learning techniques may be effectively benchmarked using the standardized approach, which delivers quantifiable performance measures and is highly configurable.

480045276,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"A computationally efficient method for online joint state inference and dynamical model learning is presented. The dynamical model combines an a priori known, physically derived, state-space model with a radial basis function expansion representing unknown system dynamics and inherits properties from both physical and data-driven modeling. The method uses an extended Kalman filter approach to jointly estimate the state of the system and learn the unknown system dynamics, via the parameters of the basis function expansion. The key contribution is a computational complexity reduction compared to a similar approach with globally supported basis functions. By using compactly supported radial basis functions and an approximate Kalman gain, the computational complexity is considerably reduced and is essentially determined by the support of the basis functions. The approximation works well when the system dynamics exhibit limited correlation between points well separated in the state-space domain. The method is exemplified via two intelligent vehicle applications where it is shown to: (i) have competitive system dynamics estimation performance compared to the globally supported basis function method, and (ii) be real-time applicable to problems with a large-scale state-space.Funding: Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) - Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</p",,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Online Joint State Inference and Learning of Partially Unknown State-Space Models,10.1109/TSP.2021.3095709,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

491084922,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Miniaturization of electronics devices is often limited by the concomitant high heat fluxes (cooling load) and maldistribution of temperature profiles (hot spots). Thermal energy storage (TES) platforms providing supplemental cooling can be a cost-effective solution, that often leverages phase change materials (PCM). Although salt hydrates provide higher storage capacities and power ratings (as compared to that of the organic PCMs), they suffer from reliability issues (e.g., supercooling). “Cold Finger Technique (CFT)” can obviate supercooling by maintaining a small mass fraction of the PCM in a solid state for enabling spontaneous nucleation. Optimization of CFT necessitates real-time forecasting of the transient values of the melt-fraction. In this study, the artificial neural network (ANN) is explored for real-time prediction of the time remaining to reach a target value of melt-fraction based on the prior history of the spatial distribution of the surface temperature transients. Two different approaches were explored for training the ANN model, using: (1) transient PCM-temperature data; or (2) transient surface-temperature data. When deployed in a heat sink that leverages PCM-based passive thermal management systems for cooling electronic chips and packages, this maverick approach (using the second method) affords cheaper costs, better sustainability, higher reliability, and resilience. The error in prediction varies during the melting process. During the final stages of the melting cycle, the errors in the predicted values are ~5% of the total time-scale of the PCM melting experiments","[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",'MDPI AG',Machine Learning (ML) Based Thermal Management for Cooling of Electronics Chips by Utilizing Thermal Energy Storage (TES) in Packaging That Leverages Phase Change Materials (PCM),10.3390/electronics10222785,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
390285317,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceIn the problem of domain generalization (DG), there are labeled training data sets from several related prediction problems, and the goal is to make accurate predictions on future unlabeled data sets that are not known to the learner. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced Blanchard et al., 2011. We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets",,Microtome Publishing,Domain Generalization by Marginal Transfer Learning,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence",,'Elsevier BV',Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at the Exascale,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

491201752,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"An image is worth a thousand words; hence, a face image illustrates extensive details about the specification, gender, age, and emotional states of mind. Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise. The proposed method is compared with existing approaches using four evaluation metrics, namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

Consequently, analysing online conversations, for example, to predict election outcomes, is becoming a popular and challenging research area. On social networking sites, citizens express themselves spontaneously regarding political topics, often driven by specific events in social life. Real-time analysis of social media can provide valuable feedback and insights to both politicians and news agencies. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a system for tracking and analysing social media.

By the time of this article, most states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses a haar cascade classifier to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. With the increasing number of cases all over the world, a system to replace humans to check masks on the faces of people is greatly needed. This system satisfies that need. This system can be employed in public places like transport stations and malls. It will be of great help in companies and huge establishments where there will be a lot of workers.   Alongside this, we have used basic concepts of transfer learning in neural networks to finally output the presence or absence of a face mask in an image or a video stream. Experimental results show that our model performs well on the test data with 100 percent and 99 percent precision and recall, respectively. We are making a savvy framework that will identify whether the specific user has worn the mask or not and further tell the accuracy level of the detection. Our framework will be python and AI-based which will be safe and quick for implementation.  This system will be of great help there because it is easy to obtain and store the data of the employees working in that Company and will very easily find the people who are not wearing the mask and a will be  sent to that respective person to take Precautions not wearing a mask.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples. The results for BiLSTM shows that even with a holdout of 90%, the model was still able to effectively recognize PD with an average accuracy for ten rounds experiment using 22 features as 82.86%, 97.1%, and 96.37% for original, augmented (Spline) and augmented (Pchip) datasets, respectively.

Much effort has been paid to fully understand the relationship between mesoscopic network structure and macroscopic mechanical properties of hydrogels.

First, network structural models of hydrogels are constructed from mesoscopic scale using self-avoiding walk method. The constructed model is similar to the real hydrogel network. Then, two deep learning models are proposed to capture the nonlinear mapping from mesoscopic hydrogel network structural model to its macroscale mechanical property. A deep neural network and a 3D convolutional neural network containing the physical information of the network structural model are implemented to predict the nominal stress–stretch curves of hydrogels under uniaxial tension. Our results show that the end-to-end deep learning framework can effectively predict the nominal stress–stretch curves of hydrogel within a wide range of mesoscopic network structures, which demonstrates that the deep learning models are able to capture the internal relationship between complex network structures and mechanical properties.

Two main contributions can be highlighted from this research. First, a method is proposed to automatically analyze the microstructural elements of vegetal tissue; and second, a comparison was conducted to select a classifier to discriminate between tissue structures. For the comparison, a database of microstructural elements images was obtained from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) micrographs. Two classifiers were implemented using CNN and RBNN, and statistical performance metrics were computed using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. This process was repeated one hundred times with a random selection of images in each repetition. The comparison showed that the classifiers based on CNN produced a better fit, obtaining F1¿score average of 89.42% in front of 83.83% for RBNN.

227186025,,"In this paper we present a new methodology for robot learning that combines ideas from statistical generalization and reinforcement learning. First we apply statistical generalization to compute an approximation for the optimal control policy as defined by training movements that solve the given task in a number of specific situations. This way we obtain a manifold of movements, which dimensionality is usually much smaller than the dimensionality of a full space of movement primitives. Next we refine the policy by means of reinforcement learning on the approximating manifold, which results in a learning problem constrained to the low dimensional manifold. We show that in some situations, learning on the low dimensional manifold can be implemented as an error learning algorithm. We apply golden section search to refine the control policy. Furthermore, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with an extended parameter set, which combines learning in constrained domain with learning in full space of parametric movement primitives, which makes it possible to explore actions outside of the initial approximating manifold.

479942346,2021-07-15T00:00:00,"This interdisciplinary article presents a concept of the 21st century and phenomena that are products of the 4th industrial revolution – big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies – as well as the opportunities of their application in public governance and social policy. This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of big data, problems of data collection, its reliability and use. Big data can be used for the analysis and modeling of phenomena relevant to public governance and social policy. Big data consist of three main types: a) historical data, b) present data with little delay, c) prognostic data for future forecasting. The following categories of big data can be defined as: a) data from social networks, b) traditional data from business systems, c) machine-generated data, such as water extraction, pollution, satellite information. The article analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of big data. There are big data challenges such as data security, lack of cooperation in civil service and social work, in rare situations – data fragmentation, incompleteness and erroneous issues, as well as ethical issues regarding the analysis of data and its use in social policy and social administration.
Big data, covered by Artificial Intelligence, can be used in public governance and social policy by identifying “the hot spots” of various phenomena, by prognosing the meanings of variables in the future on the basis of past time rows, and by calculating the optimal motion of actions in the situations where there are possible various alternatives. The technologies of Artificial Intelligence are used more profoundly in many spheres of public policy, and in the governance of COVID-19 pandemics too.
The substantial advantages of the provided big data and Artificial Intelligence are a holistic improvement of public services, possibilities of personalization, the enhancement of citizen satisfaction, the diminishing of the costs of processing expenditure, the targeting of adopted and implemented decisions, more active involvement of citizens, the feedback of the preferences of policy formation and implementation, the observation of social phenomenas in real time, and possibilities for more detailed prognosing.
Challenges to security of data, necessary resources and competences, the lack of cooperation in public service, especially rare instances of data fragmentation, roughness, falseness, and ethical questions regarding data analysis and application can be evaluated as the most significant problems of using big data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.
Big data and their analytics conducted using Artificial Intelligence technologies can contribute to the adequacy and objectivity of decisions in public governance and social policy, effectively curbing corruption and nepotism by raising the authority and confidence of public sector organizations in governance, which is so lacking in the modern world.Šiame tarpdisciplininiame straipsnyje pateikiama XXI amžiaus ketvirtosios pramonės revoliucijos fenomenų – didžiųjų duomenų ir dirbtinio intelekto technologijų – samprata ir aptariamos jų naudojimo viešojo valdymo srityje ir socialinėje politikoje galimybės, nagrinėjami didžiųjų duomenų pranašumai ir trūkumai, jų rinkimo, patikimumo ir naudojimo problemos.

491009957,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"As machining processes are complex in nature due to the involvement of large plastic strains occurring at higher strain rates, and simultaneous thermal softening of material, it is necessary for manufacturers to have some manner of determining whether the inputs will achieve the desired outputs within the limitations of available resources. However, finite element simulations—the most common means to analyze and understand the machining of high-performance materials under various cutting conditions and environments—require high amounts of processing power and time in order to output reliable and accurate results which can lead to delays in the initiation of manufacture. The objective of this study is to reduce the time required prior to fabrication to determine how available inputs will affect the desired outputs and machining parameters. This study proposes a hybrid predictive methodology where finite element simulation data and machine learning are combined by feeding the time series output data generated by Finite Element Modeling to an Artificial Neural Network in order to acquire reliable predictions of optimal and/or expected machining inputs (depending on the application of the proposed approach) using what we describe as a backwards training model. The trained network was then fed a test dataset from the simulations, and the results acquired show a high degree of accuracy with regards to cutting force and depth of cut, whereas the predicted/expected feed rate was wildly inaccurate. This is believed to be due to either a limited dataset or the much stronger effect that cutting speed and depth of cut have on power, cutting forces, etc., as opposed to the feed rate. It shows great promise for further research to be performed for implementation in manufacturing facilities for the generation of optimal inputs or the real-time monitoring of input conditions to ensure machining conditions do not vary beyond the norm during the machining process","[{'title': 'Materials', 'identifiers': ['issn:1996-1944', '1996-1944']}]",'MDPI AG',A Hybrid Finite Element—Machine Learning Backward Training Approach to Analyze the Optimal Machining Conditions,10.3390/ma14216717,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
491096314,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"Proprioception, the ability to perceive one's own configuration and movement in space, enables organisms to safely and accurately interact with their environment and each other. The underlying sensory nerves that make this possible are highly dense and use sophisticated communication pathways to propagate signals from nerves in muscle, skin, and joints to the central nervous system wherein the organism can process and react to stimuli. In a step forward to realize robots with such perceptive capability, a flexible sensor framework that incorporates a novel modeling strategy, taking advantage of computational mechanics and machine learning, is proposed. The sensor framework on a large flexible sensor that transforms sparsely distributed strains into continuous surface is implemented. Finite element (FE) analysis is utilized to determine design parameters, while an FE model is built to enrich the morphological data used in the supervised training to achieve continuous surface reconstruction. A mapping between the local strain data and the enriched surface data is subsequently trained using ensemble learning. This hybrid approach enables real time, robust, and high‐order surface reconstruction. The sensing performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and feasibility with numerous scenarios, which has not been demonstrated on such a large‐scale sensor before","[{'title': 'Advanced Intelligent Systems', 'identifiers': ['2640-4567', 'issn:2640-4567']}]",'Wiley',Large‐Scale Surface Shape Sensing with Learning‐Based Computational Mechanics,10.1002/aisy.202100089,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482629957,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"Objective: Traditionally, cadaveric courses have been an important tool in surgical education for Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). The recent COVID-19 pandemic, however, has had a significant global impact on such courses due to its travel restrictions, social distancing regulations, and infection risk. Here, we report the world-first remote (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) FESS training course between Japan and Australia, utilizing novel 3D-printed sinus models. We examined the feasibility and educational effect of the course conducted entirely remotely with encrypted telemedicine software.Methods: Three otolaryngologists in Hokkaido, Japan, were trained to perform frontal sinus dissections on novel 3D sinus models of increasing difficulty, by two rhinologists located in Adelaide, South Australia. The advanced manufactured sinus models were 3D printed from the Computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Using Zoom and the Quintree telemedicine platform, the surgeons in Adelaide first lectured the Japanese surgeons on the Building Block Concept for a three Dimensional understanding of the frontal recess. They in real time directly supervised the surgeons as they planned and then performed the frontal sinus dissections. The Japanese surgeons were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to their experience and the time taken to perform the frontal dissection was recorded. The course was streamed to over 200 otolaryngologists worldwide.Results: All dissectors completed five frontal sinusotomies. The time to identify the frontal sinus drainage pathway (FSDP) significantly reduced from 1,292 ± 672 to 321 ± 267 s (p = 0.02), despite an increase in the difficulty of the frontal recess anatomy. Image analysis revealed the volume of FSDP was improved (2.36 ± 0.00 to 9.70 ± 1.49 ml, p = 0.014). Questionnaires showed the course's general benefit was 95.47 ± 5.13 in dissectors and 89.24 ± 15.75 in audiences.Conclusion: The combination of telemedicine software, web-conferencing technology, standardized 3D sinus models, and expert supervision, provides excellent training outcomes for surgeons in circumstances when classical surgical workshops cannot be realized","[{'title': 'Frontiers in Surgery', 'identifiers': ['issn:2296-875X', '2296-875x']}]",'Frontiers Media SA',Remote Training of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery With Advanced Manufactured 3D Sinus Models and a Telemedicine System,10.3389/fsurg.2021.746837,https://core.ac.uk/download/482629957.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478204378,2021-08-26T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods & Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of > 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P < 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",,'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,10.22456/1679-9216.111167,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this recordShared e-mobility services have been widely tested and piloted in cities across the globe, and already woven into the fabric of modern urban planning. This paper studies a practical yet important problem in those systems: how to deploy and manage their infrastructure across space and time, so that the services are ubiquitous to the users while sustainable in profitability. However, in real-world systems evaluating the performance of different deployment strategies and then finding the optimal plan is prohibitively expensive, as it is often infeasible to conduct many iterations of trial-and-error. We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation environment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility systems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the real-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the optimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the real-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search approach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative deployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a multi-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are used to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed loop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating better deployment plans in future iterations. The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively in our simulation environment, and experimental results show that it outperforms baselines e.g., human knowledge, and state-of-the-art heuristic-based optimization approaches in both service coverage and net revenue.Alan Turing InstituteEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC","[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems', 'identifiers': ['1524-9050', 'issn:1524-9050']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Deployment Optimization for Shared e-Mobility Systems with Multi-agent Deep Neural Search,10.1109/TITS.2021.3125745,https://core.ac.uk/download/489426654.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
390193721,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceIn the problem of domain generalization (DG), there are labeled training data sets from several related prediction problems, and the goal is to make accurate predictions on future unlabeled data sets that are not known to the learner. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced Blanchard et al., 2011. We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets",,Microtome Publishing,Domain Generalization by Marginal Transfer Learning,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this study, we test the feasibility of a deep UV Raman spectrometer for the detection of nitrate/nitrite, selected pharmaceuticals and the most widespread microplastic polymers. Software utilizing artificial intelligence, such as a convolutional neural network, is trained for recognizing typical spectral patterns of individual pollutants, once processed by mathematical filters and machine learning algorithms.

479312419,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables enterprises to manage large amounts of data in order to derive predictions about future performance and to gain meaningful insights. In this context, descriptive and predictive analytics has gained a significant research attention; however, prescriptive analytics has just started to emerge as the next step towards increasing data analytics maturity and leading to optimized decision making ahead of time. Although machine learning for decision making has been identified as one of the most important applications of AI, up to now, prescriptive analytics is mainly addressed with domain-specific optimization models. On the other hand, existing literature lacks generalized prescriptive analytics models capable of being dynamically adapted according to the human preferences. Reinforcement Learning, as the third machine learning paradigm alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning, has the potential to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and time-variant environments, the huge states space of sequential decision making processes, as well as the incomplete knowledge. In this paper, we propose a human-augmented prescriptive analytics approach using Interactive Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (IMORL) in order to cope with the complexity of real-life environments and the need for optimized human-machine collaboration. The decision making process is modelled in a generalized way in order to assure scalability and applicability in a wide range of problems and applications.

However, in 2021 the tourism sector is slowly rising marked by the number of tourist attractions that are starting to open to the public with the implementation of strict health protocols. However, in practice there are still many cases of violations of health protocols in various tourist attractions, ranging from the undisciplined use of masks, not keeping a distance (social distancing), and the absence of setting the ideal number of visitors during a pandemic like the current one. Managers of tourist attractions tend to ignore restrictions on the number of visitors due to the absence of an management system to run. There needs to be an application that can inform the condition of visitors to tourist attractions in real-time so that people have self-awareness of their personal health so that people can make early plans before traveling. In good governance, this application contributes to controlling the risk of Covid-19 transmission originating from crowded centers (tourist spots). The government can easily monitor the distribution of tourist visitor density in the area so that it can then be used as a basis for carrying out policies and handling in the field.

The work ends with a discussion in which the staged and segmented nature of the changes introduced in the analyzed sector is emphasized. Based on the three case studies described in the paper, a comparative analysis was conducted between them. When we tried to compare methods used in the three analyzed steel producers (capital groups): ArcelorMittal, Thyssenkrupp, and Tata Steel Group, it can be seen that in all organizations, the main problem connected with steelworks 4.0 transition is the digitalization of all processes within an organization and in the entire supply chain. This is realized using various tools and methods but they are concentrated on using technologies and methods such as artificial intelligence, drones, virtual reality, full automatization, and industrial robots. The effects are connected to better relations with customers, which leads to an increase in customer satisfaction and the organizations’ profit. The steel industry will undergo further strong changes, bringing it closer to Industry 4.0 because it occupies an important place in the economies of many countries due to the strong dependence of steel producers on the markets of the recipients (steel consumers). Steel is the basic material needed to make many products, and its properties have been valued for centuries. In addition, steel mills with positive economic, social, and environmental aspects are part of the concept of sustainability for industries and economies","[{'title': 'Energies', 'identifiers': ['issn:1996-1073', '1996-1073']}]",'MDPI AG',Transitioning of Steel Producers to the Steelworks 4.0—Literature Review with Case Studies,10.3390/en14144109,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The use of recommendation systems is common in e-commerce websites now-a-days. Since enormous amounts of data including users’ click streams, purchase history, demographics, social networking comments and user-item ratings are stored in e-commerce systems databases, the volume of the data is getting bigger at high speed, and the data is sparse. However, the recommendations and predictions must be made in real time, enabling to bring enormous benefits to human beings. Apache spark is well suited for applications which require high speed query of data, transformation and analytics results. Therefore, the recommendation system developed in this research is implemented on Apache Spark. Also, the matrix factorization using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm which is a type of collaborative filtering is used to solve overfitting issues in sparse data and increases prediction accuracy. The overfitting problem arises in the data as the user-item rating matrix is sparse. In this research a recommendation system for e-commerce using alternating least squares (ALS) matrix factorization method on Apache Spark MLlib is developed. The research shows that the RMSE value is significantly reduced using ALS matrix factorization method and the RMSE is 0.870. Consequently, it is shown that the ALS algorithm is suitable for training explicit feedback data set where users provide ratings for items.ISBN för värdpublikation: 978-3-030-68153-1,  978-3-030-68154-8</p",,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Recommendation System for E-commerce Using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on Apache Spark,10.1007/978-3-030-68154-8_75,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479911473,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Описана исследовательская программа когнитивно-информационного моделирования социальной реальности в массовой коммуникации. Моделирование рассматривается как метод исследования концептуализированных фрагментов социальной реальности, образующих и формирующих медиасферу – иерархическую гиперсеть, образуемую концептами национальной концептосферы и медиасобытиями. В качестве материала используются 207 обучающих текстовых выборок, каждая из которых посвящена одному медиасобытию, входящему в медиаповестку российских массмедиа за годовой период. The article describes the research program of social reality cognitive-information modeling in mass communication. Modeling in this case is considered as a method to investigate conceptualized fragments of social reality, which form and shape the media sphere. The media sphere appears as a hierarchical hyper network, the lower level of which is constituted by the concepts of the national concept sphere, while the upper levels represent media events along with their various clusters. Media events are not understood as mirror images of social reality phenomena, but rather as modes of their existence for mass audiences. In order to select media events for this study, we considered the current media agenda, which consists of issues with a significant number of reposts of relevant messages by a wide range of sources that reflect different views on specific social events. The study included the implementation of the following steps. (1) Media events were collected, and each of them was presented in the form of a sample of unique texts (publications in the media). The material was collected through the web application “Automated Classifier of News Content”, tagging text messages of users of the social network MirTesen. As a result, 207 training text samples were studied, each of which is devoted to a single media event that is included in the media agenda of the Russian mass media over a year. Within the framework of the supervised machine learning methods, each sample of at least one hundred unique publications in the Russian media was used to create a model of the event. Such models were used for automatic tagging classification of new texts placed on the MirTesen platform (automatic classification revealed the relevance of each created media event model). The total amount of training samples was more than 40,000 media texts; the total number of tagged texts is more than 1 million. (2) Each media event was designated by ten most significant concepts represented in the attributes of its model. The model was built on the basis of mathematical processing of a texts sample. The units (words and word combinations), identified as a result of applying the TF-IDF method and ranked by criterion х2, were regarded as concepts due to the fact that in their system of presenting media events they serve as a knowledge construct that sets the perception and understanding of a given event in the interests of leading actors. (3) The concept hyper-network, representing the national sociopolitical concept sphere, which was formed in the Russian mass media in the studied time period, was reconstructed. In total, there are 1,317 nodes (concepts) and 8,822 edges in the constructed hypernet. (4) Clustering using the hypergraph modularity method and subgraph selection was made. (5) The most significant classes of events were described/interpreted. As a result of the research, a conceptual apparatus has been developed for modeling the media sphere, which combines methods of machine learning, linguistic analysis, network analysis and visual analytics. In this work, the classes of media events were reconstructed, their hierarchy (conceptual priorities) was established, and the relationship between media events was revealed. The most significant classes of media events were the EVENTS (10.48% of the vertices of the hypergraph network), PERSONIFIED POWER (9.79%), UKRAINE (8.5%) and COURT (7.2%).

491013080,2021-11-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the implementation of an autonomous electric vehicle (EV) project in the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) campus in Taiwan. The aim of this work was to integrate two important practices of realizing an autonomous vehicle in a campus environment, including vehicle positioning and path tracking. Such a project is helpful to the students to learn and practice key technologies of autonomous vehicles conveniently. Therefore, a laboratory-made EV was equipped with real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) to provide centimeter position accuracy. Furthermore, the model predictive control (MPC) was proposed to perform the path tracking capability. Nevertheless, the RTK-GPS exhibited some robust positioning concerns in practical application, such as a low update rate, signal obstruction, signal drift, and network instability. To solve this problem, a multisensory fusion approach using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was utilized to improve the vehicle positioning performance by further considering an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometry. On the other hand, the model predictive control (MPC) is usually used to control autonomous EVs. However, the determination of MPC parameters is a challenging task. Hence, reinforcement learning (RL) was utilized to generalize the pre-trained datum value for the determination of MPC parameters in practice. To evaluate the performance of the RL-based MPC, software simulations using MATLAB and a laboratory-made, full-scale electric vehicle were arranged for experiments and validation. In a 199.27 m campus loop path, the estimated travel distance error was 0.82% in terms of UKF. The MPC parameters generated by RL also achieved a better tracking performance with 0.227 m RMSE in path tracking experiments, and they also achieved a better tracking performance when compared to that of human-tuned MPC parameters","[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",'MDPI AG',Integrating Vehicle Positioning and Path Tracking Practices for an Autonomous Vehicle Prototype in Campus Environment,10.3390/electronics10212703,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
490592519,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: Following the induction of oestrus out of season in small ruminants, low fertility and variations in fertility rates are associated with embryonic losses. One of the main causes of embryonic loss is luteal dysfunction. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) supports the luteal structure, and increasing progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of promoting embryonic life. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH administration following an oestrus induction protocol in the anoestrus season for preventing embryonic loss in goats having failure to conceive during the season. Materials, Methods &amp; Results: In the study, 106 Damascus goats aged 3-5 years and weighing 45-60 kg were used. The oestrus of 106 goats in the anoestrous group was stimulated with progesterone and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) treatment. Out of breeding season, goats were divided into the 4 following groups: GnRH0 (n = 27), GnRH7 (n = 26), GnRH0+7 (n = 27) and control (n = 26). In each goat, an intravaginal sponge (IS) containing 20 mg of fluorogestone acetate (FGA) was placed into the vagina and left for 9 days. With the withdrawal of the sponge, 550IU PMSG and 125 μg of d-cloprostenol were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus detection was made via teaser bucks for 3 days starting 24 h after withdrawal of the IS. Eighteen bucks known to be fertile were used for breeding. Goats in the oestrus period were mated via natural breeding. The GnRH analogue lecirelin was injected intramuscularly at breeding in the GnRH0 group, on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH7 group, and both at breeding and on day 7 post-breeding in the GnRH0+7 group. No injections were given to the control group. Blood samples for progesterone measurement were taken by jugular vena puncturing on days 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 after breeding from 10 randomly chosen goats in all groups. The goats with a level of &gt; 3.5 ng/mL of progesterone on day 21 post-breeding were evaluated as pregnant. Pregnancy was also viewed on day 50 after breeding by real-time ultrasonography (USG) with a 5-7.5 MHz convex probe. The oestrus rate was 96.23% (102/106) in the goats. The rates of onset of oestrus between 36-48 h, 48-60 h and 60 h and beyond were 38.7% (41/106), 21.7% (23/106) and 35.8% (38/106), respectively. The total pregnancy rate was 35.8% (38/106). There were no statistically significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) found for the pregnancy rate, embryonic death rate or progesterone concentration of the groups. However, serum progesterone levels were statistically different in the GnRH7 group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05).Discussion: After synchronisation, various anti-luteolytic strategies can be used to support corpus luteum development and elevate progesterone concentration in the luteal phase to decrease embryonic loss and increase reproductive performance. Therefore, application of GnRH to support the luteal structure and to increase progesterone levels may be beneficial in terms of supporting embryonic life. The results showed that GnRH treatment on the day 7 post-breeding following oestrus induction, including FGA and PMSG, can increase serum progesterone levels in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period. However, following oestrus induction in the anoestrus period, it was seen that GnRH treatment at breeding or on day 7 after breeding did not have any positive effect on embryonic loss or reproductive performance. In conclusion, it was considered that this protocol could be implemented successfully, yielding a 35% pregnancy rate in Damascus goats in the anoestrus period, but embryonic loss must be deeply studied in detail",,'PGDesign / Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul',The Effect of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Administration on Fertility and Embryonic Loss in Goats during the Anoestrus Period,,https://core.ac.uk/download/490592519.pdf,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

BN have been applied in a wide range of real-world domains, such as medical diagnosis, forensic analysis, dependability assessment, risk management, etc. With respect to other types of models, BN provide relevant advantages: at the modelling level, the compact representation of the joint distribution of the system variables leads to the factorization of the set of possible states, avoiding the generation of the complete state space of the system; at the analysis level, inference algorithms can compute the probability distribution of any variable, possibly conditioned on the observation of the value (state) of other variables, so that predictive and diagnostic measures can be easily evaluated. During the years, BN have been extended in order to increase their modelling and analysis power; for instance, Dynamic Bayesian Networks and Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks take time into account, Hybrid Bayesian Networks deal with both discrete and continuous variables, Decision Networks contain decision nodes and value nodes.

This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.

Materials and methods: A total of 100 patients with a mean age 25.1 of years were included in this study. In 33 patients a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and in seven patients a Le Fort I osteotomy was performed. A total of 60 patients were treated by a bimaxillary approach. Onyx Ceph (R) was used as cephalometric planning software (Onyx Ceph (R)), followed by mock operations. Postoperative cephalograms were obtained after 3.3 days and compared to preoperative planning cephalograms for sagittal (SNA, SNB, ANB) and vertical (ArGoMe, ML-NSL, NL-NSL) angle measurements. Real and absolute mean deviation were documented. Results: Absolute mean deviation (degrees) between postoperative and planned jaw movement was lower for the sagittal parameters SNA (0.58), SNB (1.15) and ANB (1.05) compared to the vertical parameters NL-NSL (1.47), ML-NSL (1.96) and ArGoMe (3.20). SNA, SNB and ANB showed constant deviations independent from the extent of jaw movement. With regard to the vertical parameters ML-NSL, ArGoMe and NL-NSL the extent of the postoperative rotational jaw movement was not as much as planned, particularly for vertical shifts of more than 4 degrees. Conclusion: By using the 2D Onyx Ceph (R) cephalometric software for orthognathic surgery, the deviations between planned and actual movements are within an acceptable and predictable range.

323114427,2019-12-01T00:00:00,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: During the last years different model solutions were proposed for solving cell forces under different conditions. The solution relies on a deformation field that is obtained under cell relaxation with a chemical cocktail. Once the deformation field of the matrix is determined, cell forces can be computed by an inverse algorithm, given the mechanical properties of the matrix. Most of the Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) methods presented so far relied on a linear stress-strain response of the matrix. However, the mechanical response of some biopolymer networks, such as collagen gels is more complex. In this work, we present a numerical method for solving cell forces on non-linear materials. METHODS: The proposed method relies on solving the inverse problem based on an iterative optimization. The objective function is defined by least-square minimization of the difference between the target and the current computed deformed configuration of the cell, and the iterative formulation is based on the solution of several direct mechanical problems. The model presents a well-posed discretized inverse elasticity problem in the absence of regularization. The algorithm can be easily implemented in any kind of Finite Element (FE) code as a sequence of different standard FE analysis. RESULTS: To illustrate the proposed iterative formulation we apply the theoretical model to some illustrative examples by using real experimental data of Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast cells (NHDF) migrating inside a 2 mg/ml collagen-based gel. Different examples of application have been simulated to test the inverse numerical model proposed and to investigate the effect of introducing the correct cell properties onto the obtained cell forces. The algorithm converges after a small number of iterations, generating errors of around 5% for the tractions field in the cell contour domain. The resulting maximum traction values increased by 11% as a consequence of doubling the mechanical properties of the cell domain. CONCLUSIONS: With the results generated from computations we demonstrate the application of the algorithm and explain how the mechanical properties of both, the cell and the gel, domains are important for arriving to the correct results when using inverse traction force reconstruction algorithms, however, have only a minor effect on the resulting traction values.status: accepte",An iterative finite element-based method for solving inverse problems in traction force microscopy,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105056,,"[{'title': 'Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine', 'identifiers': ['1872-7565', '0169-2607', 'issn:0169-2607', 'issn:1872-7565']}]",'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237114799,2018,"Public bicycle sharing programmes (PBSPs) have become increasingly popular across many urban areas in China. Hangzhou PBSP is the world&#039;s largest and forms this case study. The management of this large inventory of bicycles is a particularly challenging issue with the goal to ensure the demand for bicycles is met at all times across the network. To this end, an efficient scheduling approach is needed with the capacity to guide the redistribution of bicycles across the self-service stations. Drawing on 7 years of disaggregate trip data, this study first captures the usage dynamics across both space and time to extract the candidate stations and redistribution periods for vehicle scheduling. A region partition method with K-means clustering is proposed to satisfy the real-time requirement of large-scale PBSPs&#039; redistribution. Moreover, drawing on the variations in demand a back-propagation neural network short-term prediction model is computed to inform the necessary prospective redistribution of bicycles to ensure demand is always met. Finally, a vehicle scheduling model employing a rolling horizon scheduling algorithm is established and implemented in a GIS-based prototype system.

226908873,2019-07-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThe Industry 4.0 framework needs new intelligent approaches. Thus, the manufacturing industries more and more pay close attention to artificial intelligence (AI). For example, smart monitoring and diagnosis, real time evaluation and optimization of the whole production and raw materials management can be improved by using machine learning and big data tools. An accurate milling process implies a high quality of the obtained material surface (roughness, flatness). With the involvement of AI-based algorithms, milling process is expected to be more accurate during complex operations.In this work, a smart milling diagnosis has been developed for composite sandwich structures based on honey-comb core. The use of such material has grown considerably in recent years, especially in the aeronautic, aerospace, sporting and automotive industries. But the precise milling of such material presents many difficulties. The objective of this work is to develop a data-driven industrial surface quality diagnosis for the milling of honey-comb material, by using supervised machine learning methods. Therefore, cutting forces and workpiece material vibrations are online measured in order to predict the resulting surface flatness.The workpiece material studied in this investigation is Nomex® honeycomb cores with thin cell walls. The Nomex® honeycomb machining presents several defects related to its composite nature (uncut fiber, tearing of the walls), the cutting conditions and to the alveolar geometry of the structure which causes vibration on the different components of the cutting effort.Given the low level of cutting forces, the quality of the obtained machined surface allows to establish criteria for determining the machinability of the honeycomb structures. Nearly 40 features are calculated in time domain and frequency domain from the raw signal in steady state behavior (transient zones are not taken into account). The features are then normalized. The input parameters for each experiment are: the tool rotation speed, the cutting speed and the depth of cut. It is then necessary to make a dimensional reduction of that feature table in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce the computing time of the learning algorithm.In this work, several classification algorithms have been implemented such as : k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The different supervised learning algorithms have been implemented and compared. Each AI-based model has been applied to a set of features. From the prediction results, SVM algorithm seems to be the most efficient algorithm in this application",Milling diagnosis using machine learning approaches,,,,HAL CCSD,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

Due to the notable similarities in growth patterns of neuronal cells and mycelial networks, we sought to repurpose the NeuroTrack (NT) processing module of the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system as a tool to quantify mycelial growth and branching of pathogenic fungi. We showed the robustness of NT analysis to study Candida albicans and five different molds and confirmed established characteristics of mycelial growth kinetics. We also documented high intra-and interassay reproducibility of the NT module for a spectrum of spore inocula and culture periods. Using GFP-expressing Aspergillus fumigatus and Rhizopus arrhizus, the feasibility of fluorescence-based NT analysis was validated. In addition, we performed proof-of-concept experiments of NT analysis for several translational applications such as studying the morphogenesis of a filamentation-defective C. albicans mutant, the effects of different classes of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, and echino-candins), and coculture with host immune cells. High accuracy was found, even at high immune cell-to-fungus ratios or in the presence of fungal debris. For antifungal efficacy studies, addition of a cytotoxicity dye further refined IncuCyte-based analysis, facilitating real-time determination of fungistatic and fungicidal activity in a single assay. Complementing conventional MIC-based assays, NT analysis is an appealing method to study fungal morphogenesis and viability in the context of antifungal compound screening and evaluation of novel immune therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Pathogenic fungi remain a major cause of infectious complications in immunocompromised patients. Microscopic techniques are crucial for our understanding of fungal biology, host-pathogen interaction, and the pleiotropic effects of antifungal drugs on fungal cell growth and morphogenesis. Taking advantage of the morphological similarities of neuronal cell networks and mycelial growth patterns, we employed the IncuCyte time-lapse microscopy system and its NeuroTrack image analysis software package to study growth and branching of a variety of pathogenic yeasts and molds. Using optimized image processing definitions, we validated IncuCyte NeuroTrack analysis as a reliable and efficient tool for translational applications such as antifungal efficacy evaluation and coculture with host immune effector cells. Hence, the IncuCyte system and its NeuroTrack module provide an appealing platform for efficient in vitro studies of antifungal compounds and immunotherapeu-tic strategies in medical mycology.openWurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P.Wurster S.; Kumaresan P.R.; Albert N.D.; Hauser P.J.; Lewis R.E.; Kontoyiannis D.P","Live monitoring and analysis of fungal growth, viability, and mycelial morphology using the incucyte neurotrack processing module",10.1128/mBio.00673-19,https://core.ac.uk/download/233571269.pdf,,'American Society for Microbiology',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A common approach in phishing is through the use of e-mail communication with an embedded hyperlink. The detection and mitigation of phishing attacks are a grand challenge due to the complexity of current phishing attacks. Existing techniques are often too time consuming to be used in the real world in terms of detection and mitigation time. Likewise, they employ static detection rules that are not effective in the real world due to the dynamics of phishing attacks.

The proposed DPI approach consists of two components: phishing signature classification and real-time DPI. Based on the programmability of SDN, we develop the store and forward mode and the forward and inspect mode to the direct network traffic by using an artificial neural network model to classify phishing attack signatures and design the real-time DPI so that PhishLimiter can flexibly address the dynamics of phishing attacks in the real world. PhishLimiter also provides better network traffic management for containing phishing attacks since it has the global view of a network through SDN. Furthermore, we evaluate PhishLimiter using a real-world testbed environment and data sets consisting of real-world email with embedded links.

In this paper, we provide an overview of available technical solutions to enhance fairness, accountability, and transparency in algorithmic decision-making. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy-makers, and citizens to co-develop, deploy, and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness and transparency. In doing so, we describe the Open Algortihms (OPAL) project as a step towards realizing the vision of a world where data and algorithms are used as lenses and levers in support of democracy and development.

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under $170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800 mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided",Partially RepRapable automated open source bag valve mask-based ventilator,,,,Scholarship@Western,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, we address the problem of indoor room classification via several convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, i.e., VGG16, VGG19, &amp; Inception V3. The main objective is to recognize five indoor classes (bathroom, bedroom, dining room, kitchen, and living room) from a Places dataset. We considered 11600 images per class and subsequently fine-tuned the networks. The simulation studies suggest that cleaning the disparate data produced much better results in all the examined CNN architectures. We report that VGG16 &amp; VGG19 fine-tuned models with training on all layers produced the best validation accuracy, with 93.29% and 93.61% on clean data, respectively. We also propose and examine a combination model of CNN and a multi-binary classifier referred to as error correcting output code (ECOC) with the clean data. The highest validation accuracy of 15 binary classifiers reached up to 98.5%, where the average of all classifiers was 95.37%. CNN and CNN-ECOC, and an alternative form called CNN-ECOC Regression, were evaluated in real-time implementation on a NAO humanoid robot. The results show the superiority of the combination model of CNN and ECOC over the conventional CNN. The implications and the challenges of real-time experiments are also discussed in the paper",An Indoor Room Classification System for Social Robots via Integration of CNN and ECOC,,https://core.ac.uk/download/186636174.pdf,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
387260665,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The product-service system (PSS) business model has received increasing attention in equipment maintenance studies, as it has the potential to provide high value-added services for equipment users and construct ethical principles for equipment providers to support the implementation of circular economy. However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

323141626,2020-01-01T08:00:00,"2020 Elsevier Ltd Smart cities are conceptualized as a vehicle for sustainable urban development and a means to deliver high quality of life for residents. One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring",A sentiment reporting framework for major city events: Case study on the China-United States trade war,,,,'Sociological Research Online',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

162022928,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Python has evolved to become the most popular language for data science. It sports state-of-the-art libraries for analytics and machine learning, like Sci-Kit Learn. However, Python lacks the computational performance that a industrial system requires for high frequency real time predictions.

Building upon a year long research project heavily based on SciKit Learn (sklearn), we faced performance issues in deploying to production. Replacing sklearn with a better performing framework would require re-evaluating and tuning hyperparameters from scratch. Instead we developed a python embedding in a C++ based server application that increased performance by up to 20x, achieving linear scalability up to a point of convergence. Our implementation was done for mainstream cost effective hardware, which means we observed similar performance gains on small as well as large systems, from a laptop to an Amazon EC2 instance to a high-end server",Distributed C++-Python embedding for fast predictions and fast prototyping,,https://core.ac.uk/download/162022928.pdf,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

480478981,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Face detection is the task of detecting faces on photos, videos as well as the streaming data such as a webcam. Face detection, which is a specific type of general-purpose object detection, is a key prerequisite for many other artificial intelligence tasks such as face verification, face tagging and retrieval, and face tracking. In addition to that, convolutional neural nowadays, face detection is commonly used in daily routines such as social media, and network camera software of smartphones. As a result of this necessity, several face detection tools have been proposed. In this study, an experimental performance comparison of well-known face detection tools in terms of (1) accuracy, and (2) elapsed time of detection, which has become even more critical criteria especially when the face detection mechanism is utilized for a real-time system, is proposed. As a result of this experimental study, it is aimed that shed light on the much-concerned query which face detection tool provides the best performance?.

389599128,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Induction heating has become the reference technology for domestic heating applications due to its benefits in terms of performance, efficiency and safety, among others. In this context, recent design trends aim at providing highly flexible cooking surfaces composed of multi-coil structures. As in many other wireless power transfer systems, one of the main challenges to face is the proper detection of the magnetic coupling with the induction heating load in order to provide improved thermal performance and safe power electronic converter operation. This is specially challenging due to the high variability in the materials used in cookware as well as the random pot placement in flexible induction heating appliances. This paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques in order to provide accurate area overlap estimation regardless of the used pot and its position. An experimental test-bench composed of a complete power converter, multi-coil system and real-Time measurement system has been implemented and used in this study to characterize the parameter variation with overlapped area. Convolutional neural networks are then proposed as an effective method to estimate the covered area, and several implementations are studied and compared according to their computational cost and accuracy. As a conclusion, the presented deep learning-based technique is proposed as an effective tool to estimate the magnetic coupling between the coil and the induction heating load in advanced induction heating appliances",Deep Learning-Based Magnetic Coupling Detection for Advanced Induction Heating Appliances,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960109,https://core.ac.uk/download/389599128.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
523156438,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The adoption of fast-paced practices for developing virtual network functions (VNFs) allows for continuous software delivery and creates a market advantage for network operators. This adoption, however, is problematic for testing engineers that need to assure, in shorter development cycles, certain quality of highly-configurable product releases running on heterogeneous clouds. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate testing workflows by detecting performance issues in new software builds. However, the overhead of maintaining several models for all combinations of build types, network configurations, and other stack parameters, can quickly become prohibitive and make the application of ML infeasible.



We propose Env2Vec, a deep learning architecture that combines contextual features with historical resource usage, and characterizes the various stack parameters that influence the test execution within an embedding space, which allows it to generalize model predictions to previously unseen environments. We integrate a single ML model in the testing workflow to automatically debug errors and pinpoint performance bottlenecks. Results obtained with real testing data show an accuracy between 86.2%-100%, while reducing the false alarm rate by 20.9%-38.1% when reporting performance issues compared to state-of-the-art approaches",Env2Vec: accelerating VNF testing with deep learning,10.1145/3342195.3387525,https://core.ac.uk/download/523156438.pdf,,'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
159636017,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Le frane per crollo da ammassi rocciosi fratturati sono tra i processi di instabilità gravitativa che più frequentemente interessano opere antropiche quali tagli su versanti naturali o artificiali, pareti di cava, trincee stradali, autostradali o ferroviarie, sia per ciò che attiene le aree di distacco che per quelle di accumulo. Nell’ambito dell’applicazione di sistemi di early warning per la gestione del rischio geologico legato a queste tipologie di frana, una sperimentazione della tecnica del monitoraggio nanosismometrico è stata effettuata presso due siti estrattivi non più in attività: le “Pirrere” della Baia di Cala Rossa sull’isola di Favignana (Trapani), in Sicilia, e la cava dismessa di Acuto (Frosinone), in Italia Centrale. Il monitoraggio nanosismometrico è una tecnica di indagine che consente di individuare e localizzare deboli eventi sismici, fino a magnitudo locale (ML) nell’ordine di -3, attraverso l’impiego di quattro sensori sismometrici disposti secondo una specifica geometria di array detta SNS (Seismic Navigation System).

Nel presente lavoro, mediante il software NanoseismicSuite sono stati analizzati 73 eventi di crollo indotti artificialmente attraverso la caduta controllata di blocchi di roccia nei due siti estrattivi abbandonati; sono stati lanciati, simulando fenomeni di rockfalls, rispettivamente 47 blocchi di roccia nella cava di Acuto e 26 eventi in quattro diverse cave a cielo aperto presenti nel settore occidentale di Cala Rossa. Tali eventi, avendo punto epicentrale noto, hanno permesso di determinare il miglior modello di sottosuolo in termini di valori di velocità delle onde P ed S attraverso un’operazione di back analysis. L’analisi è stata, infatti, effettuata variando i valori di velocità e scegliendo quelli relativi all’epicentro teorico ottenuto dall’analisi dell’evento che fosse il più vicino possibile al punto reale di impatto del blocco di roccia. Al fine di valutare la sensibilità della geometria dell’array SNS e l’influenza del sito di installazione sulla capacità di individuare e localizzare gli eventi, le sperimentazioni sono state condotte sia variando il raggio di apertura che la zona di installazione degli array: presso Acuto le acquisizioni di segnale sono state condotte prima con un array SNS con apertura di 20 m e successivamente con un array di apertura 10 m, mentre presso Cala Rossa l’array è stato installato alternativamente all’aperto in un’area di plateau roccioso ed in una galleria facente parte dell’area di cava abbandonata.

Analizzando i dati si è ottenuta una precisione dell’ubicazione epicentrale compresa tra il 10 ed il 22% della distanza che intercorre tra la sorgente e l’array nanosismometrico. Il miglior modello di sottosuolo ottenuto per entrambi i casi di studio è risultato avere una velocità delle onde P pari a 900 m/s ed un rapporto VP/VS pari a 1.73, valori in accordo con le condizioni di intenso stato di fratturazione delle rocce carbonatiche affioranti nelle due zone di cava. Per gli eventi di crollo indotti la magnitudo ML è risultata essere compresa tra -2.8 e -1.3; considerando l’energia sviluppata dall’impatto, legata alla massa del blocco ed all’altezza e alla velocità di caduta, non è stato possibile definire una relazione tra magnitudo ed energia, probabilmente a causa delle differenti caratteristiche del punto di impatto dei diversi blocchi. In generale, si è osservato che la precisione di ubicazione degli eventi, in termini di azimuth e distanza dal reale epicentro, è risultata paragonabile sia variando l’apertura dell’array che variando il sito di installazione. Per il sito sperimentale di Acuto, il processo di picking manuale del tempo di primo arrivo delle onde P è risultato essere più affidabile nel caso di array con apertura pari a 10 m. La sperimentazione effettuata a Cala Rossa ha permesso, invece, di osservare una migliore capacità di individuazione degli eventi nelle tracce relative all’array posizionato in galleria a causa della minore rumorosità di base del sito di installazione.

Tra le registrazioni sismometriche sono state identificate varie tipologie di segnali, oltre a quelli generati dal lancio dei blocchi, alcune riconducibili ad eventi naturali di crollo altre a deboli terremoti. L’analisi dei segnali riferibili alla prima tipologia di eventi naturali, effettuata tenendo in considerazione i modelli di sottosuolo precedentemente calibrati, ha portato all’identificazione in ambedue i siti di aree aventi maggiore suscettibilità a frane per crollo. In definitiva, si può ritenere che i risultati ottenuti in questo studio siano incoraggianti rispetto all’efficacia della tecnica di monitoraggio nanosismometrico nell’individuazione e nell’ubicazione di fenomeni di crollo in roccia e portano a ritenere questa tecnica potenzialmente applicabile in aree in cui tali eventi possono interferire con infrastrutture antropiche.In the frame of early warning and risk mitigation studies for landslide processes involving rock masses, two quarry areas (Cala Rossa Bay in Sicily and Acuto in Central Italy) were monitored with SNS (Seismic Navigation System) arrays. In this study, 73 rockfalls were simulated by launches of rock blocks. This allowed to perform a back analysis for defining the best seismic velocity model of the subsoil half-space; the records related to each impact caused by the rock block launch were managed by the nanoseismic monitoring approach, varying the velocity model to obtain a theoretical epicentre as close as possible to the actual location of the impact point. In order to evaluate the sensibility of the SNS array, the results obtained by different array apertures and positions were compared in terms of azimuth and distance error with respect to the real epicentres. On the other hand, several natural rockfalls were detected; their analysis allowed to identify areas having higher susceptibility to rockfalls by using the previously calibrated subsoil half-space model. Further studies are required to better define the areas prone to rockfall generation in the considered test sites; nevertheless, the here obtained results show an encouraging perspective about the application of the nanoseismic monitoring with respect to vulnerable infrastructures in rockfall prone areas",Nanoseismic monitoring for detection of rockfalls.

288570495,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Performing multi-objective optimization under uncertainty is a common requirement in industries and academia. Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has access to behavioral data for the uncertain parameters. However, solutions of RO may be far from the real solution and less reliable due to inability to map the uncertain space accurately, especially when the data appears discontinuous and scattered in the uncertain domain. Amalgamating machine learning algorithms with RO, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology, where a novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented along-with boundary construction, to transcript the uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, using intelligent Sobol sampling, samples are generated in the mapped uncertain regions. Results of two test cases are presented along with a comprehensive comparison study. Considered case-studies include highly nonlinear model for continuous casting process from steelmaking industries, where a multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is solved to balance the conflict between productivity and energy consumption. The Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting RO problem are obtained through Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, and ∼23 – 29% improvement is observed in the objective functions. Further, the spread and diversity metrics are enhanced by ∼10 – 95% as compared to those obtained using other standard uncertainty sets",Towards Efficient Robust Optimization using Data based Optimal Segmentation of Uncertain Space,10.1016/j.ress.2020.106821,,,'Elsevier BV',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

151268456,2018-05-08T00:00:00,International audienceThe last decade has seen a rapid development of the number of NLP tools which have been made available to the community. The usability of several e-lexicography tools represents a serious obstacle for researchers with little or no background in computer science. We present in this paper our efforts to overcome this issue in the case of a machine learning system for the automatic segmentation and semantic annotation of digitised dictionaries. Our approach is based on limiting the burdens of managing the tool's setup in different execution environments and lightening the complexity of the training process. We illustrate the possibility to reach this goal through the adaptation of existing functionalities and through using out of the box software deployment technology. We also report on the community's feedback after exposing the new setup to real users of different professional backgrounds,Enhancing Usability for Automatically Structuring Digitised Dictionaries,,,,HAL CCSD,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
237331362,2018-10-08T00:00:00,"International audienceThis work deals with the optimization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). It elaborates on the concept of Adaptive Energy-Accuracy Scaling through multi-precision arithmetic, a solution that allows ConvNets to be adapted at run-time and meet different energy budgets and accuracy constraints. The strategy is particularly suited for embedded applications made run at the “edge” on resource-constrained platforms. After the very basics that distinguish the proposed adaptive strategy, the paper recalls the software-to-hardware vertical implementation of precision scalable arithmetic for ConvNets, then it focuses on the energy-driven per-layer precision assignment problem describing a meta-heuristic that searches for the most suited representation of both weights and activations of the neural network. The same heuristic is then used to explore the optimal trade-off providing the Pareto points in the energy-accuracy space. Experiments conducted on three different ConvNets deployed in real-life applications, i.e. Image Classification, Keyword Spotting, and Facial Expression Recognition, show adaptive ConvNets reach better energy-accuracy trade-off w.r.t. conventional static fixed-point quantization methods",Energy-Accuracy Scalable Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A Pareto Analysis,10.1007/978-3-030-23425-6_6,,,'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The implemented game made use of optical capture of the user’s hands using a Leap Motion controller attached to the front of a virtual reality headset. The captured gesture data was passed through a neural network for precise gesture classification in real-time, and the correct sequence of classified gestures created a spell effect in the game.

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities. Meanwhile, VIS4ML is intended to be extensible and will continue to be updated to reflect future advancements in using VA for building high-quality data-analytical models or for building such models rapidly",VIS4ML: an ontology for visual analytics assisted machine learning,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864838,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics', 'identifiers': ['1077-2626', 'issn:1077-2626']}]",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

232211197,2019-02-01T00:00:00,"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are widely used in machine learning and optimization. This paper proposes a time-dependent genetic algorithm (TDGA) based on real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to improve the convergence performance of functions over time such as a foot trajectory. TDGA has several distinguishing features when compared with traditional RCGA. First, individuals are arranged over time, and then the individuals are optimized in sequence. Second, search spaces of design variables are newly comprised of processes of reductions for search spaces. Third, the search space for crossover operations is expanded to avoid local minima traps that can occur in new search spaces up to the previous search space before performing any reduction of search space, and boundary mutation operation is performed to the new search spaces. Computer simulations are implemented to verify the convergence performance of the robot locomotion optimized by TDGA. Then, TDGA optimizes the desired feet trajectories of quadruped robots that climb up a slope and the impedance parameters of admittance control so that quadruped robots can trot stably over irregular terrains. Simulation results clearly represent that the convergence performance is improved by TDGA, which also shows that TDGA could be broadly used in robot locomotion research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, research has focused on developing a very promising form of intervention named Robot-Assisted Therapy. This area of intervention poses many challenges, including the necessary flexibility and adaptability to real unconstrained therapeutic settings, which are different from the constrained lab settings where most of the technology is typically tested. Among the most common impairments of children with autism and intellectual disability is social attention, which includes difficulties in establishing the correct visual focus of attention. This article presents an investigation on the use of novel deep learning neural network architectures for automatically estimating if the child is focusing their visual attention on the robot during a therapy session, which is an indicator of their engagement. To study the application, the authors gathered data from a clinical experiment in an unconstrained setting, which provided low-resolution videos recorded by the robot camera during the child&ndash;robot interaction. Two deep learning approaches are implemented in several variants and compared with a standard algorithm for face detection to verify the feasibility of estimating the status of the child directly from the robot sensors without relying on bulky external settings, which can distress the child with autism. One of the proposed approaches demonstrated a very high accuracy and it can be used for off-line continuous assessment during the therapy or for autonomously adapting the intervention in future robots with better computational capabilities",Deep Learning Systems for Estimating Visual Attention in Robot-Assisted Therapy of Children with Autism and Intellectual Disability,10.3390/robotics7020025,,"[{'title': 'Robotics', 'identifiers': ['2218-6581', 'issn:2218-6581']}]",'MDPI AG',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures.

211049053,2019-04-05T00:00:00,"Autonomic optical transmission and networking requires machine learning (ML) models to be trained with large datasets. However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human-computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one finds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The first branch explores geometric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the final classification score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on five benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The databases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

After the learning process, the semantic segmentation floor mask is used to implement indoor navigation and motion calculations for the autonomous mobile robot. This motion calculations are based on how much the estimated path differs from the center vertical line. The highest point is used to move the motors toward that direction. In this way, the robot can move in a real scenario by avoiding different obstacles.

First, a large-scale analysis with 628 Macro-cells (Mcells) and 221 Small-cells (Scells) is used to test different algorithms oriented to optimize the network deployment by minimizing delays, balancing the load among the Base Band Unit (BBU) pools, or clustering the Remote Radio Heads (RRH) efficiently to maximize the multiplexing gain. After planning, real-time resource allocation strategies with QoS constraints should be optimized as well. To do so, a realistic small-scale scenario for the metropolitan area is defined by modelling the individual time-variant traffic patterns of 7000 users (UEs)

connected to different services. The distribution of resources among UEs and BBUs is optimized by algorithms, based on a realistic calculation of the UEs Signal to Interference and Noise Ratios (SINRs), that account for the required computational capacity per cell, the QoS constraints and the service priorities.

Results show that even after the optimization, there are some time intervals where the allocated resources are underutilized, which opens the door to the definition of new Machine Learning algorithms able to predict the required capacity.This work has been funded by the Spanish ministry of science through the project RTI2018-099880-B-C32 and with ERFD funds.

237215238,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Parking vehicle is a daunting task and a common problem in many cities around the globe. The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection. The detected results were compared with a template of parking spaces and IoU value is used to identify vehicle occupancy information",Deep learning-based vehicle occupancy detection in an open parking lot using thermal camera,10.1049/iet-its.2019.0468,,,'Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
478373242,2019-07-16T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has wide range of applications in all areas and is gaining the understanding of the society as necessity instead of luxury. AI start ups are working to improve the quality of social interactions (social good), Education, Agriculture, manufacturing, health and medicine and public services. Hence the cost of not developing AI or developing it late is enormous. Despite the opportunities AI technologies may offer, there is a real risk that without thoughtful intervention it may in fact exacerbate structural, economic, social, and political imbalances, and further reinforce entrenched inequalities. For regulators and policymakers around the world, uneven access to technology remains a major concern because of its potential impacts on social and economic inequality. The author has conducted an exploratory research by reviewing related literatures on AI opportunities and challenges from experiences of the developed world and provided a discussion to identify the potential opportunities and expected challenges for AI adoption and implementation in Ethiopia. Finally the author has recommended what should be done.Keywords: Artificial, Intelligence,, Exploratory, Research, Skills, Infrastructure, Data, Privac",Artificial intelligence for Ethiopia: opportunities and challenges,10.4314/ict.v16i1.,,,'African Journals Online (AJOL)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Many lives have been ruined due to bullying and the fear it implants into students' mind has caused many of them to go into depression which can lead to suicide. Traditional methods [1] need to be accompanied with modern technology to make the method more effective and efficient. If real time alerts are to school staff, they can identify the perpetuator and extricate the victim swiftly. It this proposed method an AI based solution is implemented to monitor students using standard school surveillance technologies and CCTV to maintain a decorum and safe environment in the school premise. Also the proposed method utilizes other unstructured sources such as attendance records, social media activity and general nature of the students to deliver quick response. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which includes image processing capabilities, logistic regression methods, LSTM (Long short-term memory), and pre-trained model Darknet-19 is used for classification. Further, the model also included sentiment analysis to identify commonly used abuse terms and noisy labels to improve overall model accuracy. &nbsp;The model has been trained and validated with the realistic data from all the sources mentioned and has achieved the classification accuracy of 87% for detecting any sign of bullying","Using Machine Learning, Image Processing & Neural Networks to Sense Bullying in K-12 Schools",10.33130/AJCT.2020v06i01.004,,,'Asian Journal of Convergence in Technology',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389282241,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"The paper is dedicated to particular cases of interaction and mutual impact of philosophy and cognitive science. Thus, philosophical preconditions in the middle of the 20th century shaped the newly born cognitive science as mainly based on conceptual and propositional representations and syntactical inference. Further developments towards neural networks and statistical representations did not change the prejudice much: many still believe that network models must be complemented with some extra tools that would account for proper human cognitive traits. I address some real implemented connectionist models that show how ‘new associationism’ of the neural network approach may not only surpass Humean limitations, but, as well, realistically explain abstraction, inference and prediction. Then I stay on Predictive Processing theories in a little more detail to demonstrate that sophisti-cated statistical tools applied to a biologically realist ontology may not only provide solu-tions to scientific problems or integrate different cognitive paradigms but propose some philosophical insights either. To conclude, I touch on a certain parallelism of Predictive Processing and philosophical inferentialism as presented by Robert Brandom",Inference and representation: philosophical and cognitive issues,10.17223/1998863,https://core.ac.uk/download/389282241.pdf,,'Tomsk State University',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
395142912,2019-11-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Falls represent a major public health risk worldwide for the elderly people. A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elderly and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence, and life quality. In this sense, we propose IoTE-Fall system, an intelligent system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments that takes advantages of the Internet of Thing and the ensemble machine learning algorithm. IoTE-Fall system employs a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN wearable device capable of capturing in real time the data of the movements of elderly volunteers. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, in this paper, four machine learning algorithms (classifiers): decision trees, ensemble, logistic regression, and Deepnets are evaluated in terms of AUC ROC, training time and testing time. The acceleration readings are processed and analyzed at the edge of the network using an ensemble-based predictor model that is identified as the most suitable predictor for fall detection. The experiment results from collection data, interoperability services, data processing, data analysis, alert emergency service, and cloud services show that our system achieves accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity above 94%.Research presented in this article has been partially funded by Horizon 2020 European Project grant INTER-IoT no. 687283, ACTIVAGE project under grant agreement no. 732679, the Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Ecuador, and Secretaria de Educacion Superior Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SENESCYT), Ecuador.Yacchirema, D.; Suárez De Puga, J.; Palau Salvador, CE.; Esteve Domingo, M.

322493914,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"Domain science applications and workflow processes are currently forced to view the network as an opaque infrastructure into which they inject data and hope that it emerges at the destination with an acceptable Quality of Experience. There is little ability for applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments, compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture definition, reference implementation, and deployment. This provides the basis for further innovation of smart network services to accelerate scientific discovery in the era of big data, cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence",Software-Defined Network for End-to-end Networked Science at the Exascale,,https://core.ac.uk/download/322493914.pdf,,"eScholarship, University of California",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
480281567,2020-07-01T00:00:00,"Web Service registries have progressively evolved to social networks-like software repositories. Users cooperate to produce an ever-growing, rich source of Web APIs upon which new value-added Web applications can be built. Such users often interact in order to follow, comment on, consume and compose services published by other users. In this context, Web Service discovery is a core functionality of modern registries as needed Web Services must be discovered before being consumed or composed. Many efforts to provide effective keyword-based service discovery mechanisms are based on Information Retrieval techniques as services are described using structured or unstructured textdocuments that specify the provided functionality. However, traditional techniques suffer from term-mismatch, which means that only the terms that are contained in both user queries and descriptions are exploited to perform service retrieval. Early feature learning techniques such as LSA or LDA tried to solve this problem by finding hidden or latent features in text documents. Recently, alternative feature learning based techniques such as Word Embeddings achieved state of the art results for Web Service discovery. In this paper, we propose to learn features from service descriptions by using Variational Autoencoders, a special kind of autoencoder which restricts the encoded representation to model latent variables. Autoencoders in turn are deep neural networks used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. We train our autoencoder using a real 17 113-service dataset extracted from the ProgrammableWeb.com API social repository. We measure discovery efficacy by using both Recall and Precision metrics, achieving significant gains compared to both Word Embeddings and classic latent features modelling techniques. Also, performance-oriented experiments show that the proposed approach can be readily exploited in practice.Fil: Lizarralde, Ignacio. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

This paper discusses how an ""open science"" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. METHOD:In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. RESULTS:The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of ""black-box"" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing.

287207806,2019,"The pervasive and increasing deployment of smart meters allows collecting a huge amount of fine-grained energy data in different urban scenarios. 

The analysis of such data is challenging and opening up a variety of interesting and new research issues across energy and computer science research areas. 

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

As a case study, SPEC has been tested on real data {of an heating distribution network and power consumption data} collected in a major Italian city.

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPEC to forecast both fine-grained values and coarse levels of power consumption of~buildings",Exploiting scalable machine-learning distributed frameworks to forecast power consumption of buildings,10.3390/en12152933,,,'MDPI AG',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Recent developments based on the concept of Industry 4.0 such as big data, new communication protocols and artificial intelligence provide several new avenues to explore. In the specific context of machining, we are working toward the development of a system capable of making the prognostic of the quality (in terms of dimensional conformance) of a workpiece in real time while it is being manufactured. The goal of this paper is to showcase a prototype of the data acquisition aspect of this system and a case study presenting our first results. This case study has been conducted at our industrial partner facility (Quebec, Canada) and is based on the manufacturing of an aircraft component made from Inconel alloy 625 (AMS5666). The proposed prototype is a data acquisition system installed on a 5 axis CNC machines (GROB model G352) used to acquire and to contextualize the vibration signal obtained from the CNC machine sensor. The contextualization of the data is a key component for future work regarding the development of a prognostic system based on supervised machine learning algorithms. In the end, this paper depicts the system architecture as well as its interactions between the multiple systems and software already in place at our industrial partner. This paper also shows preliminary results describing the relationship between the workpiece quality (in terms of respect toward the dimensional requirements) and the extracted features from the sensors signals. We conclude that it is now possible to do the diagnostic of a cutting operation. Additionally, with the same information we show that it is possible to quickly do the general diagnostic of the health state of the machine. Future work regarding this project will include data acquisition from a wider range of products (i.e. different shapes, materials, processes, etc.) and the development of a machine learning based prognostic model",Toward the quality prognostic of an aircraft engine workpiece in Inconel Alloy 625: case study and proposed system architecture,,,,HAL CCSD,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Obtaining the method with the least prediction error is one of the difficult problems of financial market and investment analysts. State space modelling is an efficient and flexible method for statistical inference of a broad class of time series and other data. The neural network is an important tool for analyzing time series especially when it is nonlinear and nonstationary. Essential tools for the study of Box-Jenkins methodology, neural networks, and extended Kalman filter were put together. We examine the use of the nonlinear autoregressive neural network method as a prediction technique for financial time series and the application of the extended Kalman filter algorithm to improve the accuracy of the model.

Specifically, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) was applied removing the need for reliance on expert judgement, and analysed interdependencies among water quality parameters and microbiological characteristics of DWDS composed of different pipe materials. In addition, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) ranked the most common bacteria identified during trials in a DWDS according to their relative abundance while managing vagueness affecting the measurements. The novel integrated approach presented and proven here for an initial real world data set provides new insights in the interdependence of environmental conditions and microbial populations. Specifically, the application shows as the bacteria having associated the most significant microbial impact may not be the most abundant.

429121482,2020-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Background and objective: As Computed Tomography scans are an essential medical test, many techniques have been proposed to reconstruct high-quality images using a smaller amount of radiation. One approach is to employ algebraic factorization methods to reconstruct the images, using fewer views than the traditional analytical methods. However, their main drawback is the high computational cost and hence the time needed to obtain the images, which is critical in the daily clinical practice. For this reason, faster methods for solving this problem are required.

Methods: In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the QR factorization that is very efficient on affordable equipment (standard multicore processors and standard Solid-State Drives) by using Out-Of-Core techniques.

Results: Combining both affordable hardware and the new software proposed in our work, the images can be reconstructed very quickly and with high quality. We analyze the reconstructions using real Computed Tomography images selected from a dataset, comparing the QR method to the LSQR and FBP. We measure the quality of the images using the metrics Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index, obtaining very high values. We also compare the efficiency of using spinning disks versus Solid-State Drives, showing how the latter performs the Input/Output operations in a significantly lower amount of time. Conclusions: The results indicate that our proposed me thod and software are valid to efficiently solve large-scale systems and can be applied to the Computed Tomography reconstruction problem to obtain high-quality images.This research has been supported by ""Universitat Politecnica de Valencia"", ""Generalitat Valenciana"" under PROMETEO/2018/035 and ACIF/2017/075, co-financed by FEDER and FSE funds, and the ""Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities"" under Grant RTI2018-098156-B-C54 co-financed by FEDER funds.Chillarón-Pérez, M.; Quintana Ortí, G.; Vidal-Gimeno, V.; Verdú Martín, GJ.

304117829,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Deep Learning is increasingly being adopted by industry for computer vision applications running on embedded devices. While Convolutional Neural Networks' accuracy has achieved a mature and remarkable state, inference latency and throughput are a major concern especially when targeting low-cost and low-power embedded platforms. CNNs' inference latency may become a bottleneck for Deep Learning adoption by industry, as it is a crucial specification for many real-time processes. Furthermore, deployment of CNNs across heterogeneous platforms presents major compatibility issues due to vendor-specific technology and acceleration libraries.In this work, we present QS-DNN, a fully automatic search based on Reinforcement Learning which, combined with an inference engine optimizer, efficiently explores through the design space and empirically finds the optimal combinations of libraries and primitives to speed up the inference of CNNs on heterogeneous embedded devices. We show that, an optimized combination can achieve 45x speedup in inference latency on CPU compared to a dependency-free baseline and 2x on average on GPGPU compared to the best vendor library. Further, we demonstrate that, the quality of results and time ""to-solution"" is much better than with Random Search and achieves up to 15x better results for a short-time search",Learning to infer: RL-based search for DNN primitive selection on Heterogeneous Embedded Systems,10.23919/DATE.2019.8714959,https://core.ac.uk/download/304117829.pdf,,'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
477989584,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Interactive spaces for education are emerging as a mechanism for fostering children's natural ways of learning by means of play and exploration in physical spaces. The advanced interactive modalities and devices for such environments need to be both motivating and intuitive for children. Among the wide variety of interactive mechanisms, robots have been a popular research topic in the context of educational tools due to their attractiveness for children. However, few studies have focused on how children would naturally interact and explore interactive environments with robots. While there is abundant research on full-body interaction and intuitive manipulation of robots by adults, no similar research has been done with children. This paper therefore describes a gesture elicitation study that identified the preferred gestures and body language communication used by children to control ground robots. The results of the elicitation study were used to define a gestural language that covers the different preferences of the gestures by age group and gender, with a good acceptance rate in the 6-12 age range. The study also revealed interactive spaces with robots using body gestures as motivating and promising scenarios for collaborative or remote learning activities.This work is funded by the European Development Regional Fund (EDRF-FEDER) and supported by the Spanish MINECO (TIN2014-60077-R). The work of Patricia Pons is supported by a national grant from the Spanish MECD (FPU13/03831).

In this paper, we present the results of a set of experiments aimed at predicting the players\u2019 emotions during video games sessions using their physiological data.

Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of the players\u2019 mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game sessions at a precision of one second.

441907616,2020-06-01T00:00:00,"Background and Aim: In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in poultry are still reported. The disease causes a decrease in egg production and an increase in mortality; this has an impact on the economic losses of farmers. Several studies have considered that ducks play a role in the HPAI endemicity in the country; however, little is known about whether or not the type of duck farming is associated with HPAI H5 virus infection, particularly within clade 2.3.2.1c, which has been predominantly found in poultry since 2014. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the HPAI seroprevalence for H5 subtype clade 2.3.2.1c in laying ducks that are kept intensively and nomadically and to determine the associated risk factors.



Materials and Methods: Forty-nine duck farmers were randomly selected from ten sub-districts in Purbalingga District, Central Java, Indonesia; a cross-sectional study was implemented to collect field data. Based on an expected HPAI prevalence level of 10%, estimated accuracy of ± 5%, and 95% confidence interval (CI), the total sample size was calculated at 36 individuals. Samples must be multiplied by 7 to reduce bias; thus, 252 ducks were taken as samples in this study. Considering that the maintenance and duck handling were uniform and farmers complained that the effect of activity to take duck samples would reduce egg production, this study only took samples from 245 ducks (oropharyngeal swabs and serum). Those samples were taken from five birds on each farm. Hemagglutination inhibition tests examined the serum samples for HPAI H5 Clade 2.3.2.1c, and pool swab samples (five swabs in one viral media transport) were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test for influenza Type A and H5 subtype virus. Information regarding farm management was obtained using a questionnaire; face-to-face interviews were conducted with the duck farmers using native Javanese language.



Results: Serum and swabs from 245 ducks were collected in total. For individual birds, 54.69% (134/245) of serum samples were H5 seropositive. Seroprevalence among nomadic ducks was 59.28% (95% CI: 0.48-0.61), which was higher than among intensively farmed ducks (48.57%, 95% CI: 0.38-0.58). Farm-level seroprevalence was 50% (95% CI: 0.30-0.69) for nomadic ducks but only 28.57% (95% CI: 0.11-0.51) for intensively farmed ducks. The farm-level virus prevalence (proportion of flocks with at least one bird positive for influenza Type A) was 17.85% (95% CI: 0.07-0.35) for nomadic ducks and 4.76% (1/21) for intensively farmed ducks (95% CI: 0.008-0.23). All influenza Type A positive samples were negative for the H5 subtype, indicating that another HA subtype AI viruses might have been circulating in ducks in the study area. A relationship between duck farms that were H5 seropositive and their maintenance system was present; however, this relationship was not significant, the nomadic duck system detected 2 times higher H5-seropositive ducks than the intensive farming system (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 0.33-14.31).



Conclusion: This study found that the seroprevalence of HPAI in the duck population level in Purbalingga was 54.69% and demonstrated that the nomadic duck farming system was more likely to acquire HPAI H5 infection than the intensive farming duck system. Other risk factors should be further investigated as the diversity of the farming system is partially related to HPAI H5 infection","Determining highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza clade 2.3.2.1c seroprevalence in ducks, Purbalingga, Central Java, Indonesia",10.14202/vetworld.2020.1138-1144,https://core.ac.uk/download/441907616.pdf,"[{'title': 'Veterinary World', 'identifiers': ['issn:2231-0916', '2231-0916', 'issn:0972-8988', '0972-8988']}]",'Veterinary World',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Facial expressions play an important role in community-based interactions and are often used in the behavioral analysis of emotions. Recognition of automatic facial expressions from a facial image is a challenging task in the computer vision community and admits a large set of applications, such as driver safety, human–computer interactions, health care, behavioral science, video conferencing, cognitive science, and others. In this work, a deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expression of a person. The proposed method consists of two parts. The former one ﬁnds out local features from face images using a local gravitational force descriptor, while, in the latter part, the descriptor is fed into a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. The proposed DCNN has two branches. The ﬁrst branch explores geo-metric features, such as edges, curves, and lines, whereas holistic features are extracted by the second branch. Finally, the score-level fusion technique is adopted to compute the ﬁnal classiﬁca-tion score. The proposed method along with 25 state-of-the-art methods is implemented on ﬁve benchmark available databases, namely, Facial Expression Recognition 2013, Japanese Female Facial Expressions, Extended CohnKanade, Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces, and Real-world Affective Faces. The data-bases consist of seven basic emotions: neutral, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, and surprise.

been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied
to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir computing (RC) provides
efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of
the MTS that can be further processed by standard classifiers.
Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on
a standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of
fully trainable neural networks. In this article, we introduce the
reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on RC
to learn vectorial representations of MTS. Each MTS is encoded
within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a
low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared
with other RC methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance due to
an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second
contribution, we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The
framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement
advanced RC architectures. The architectures are compared with
other MTS classifiers, including deep learning models and time

Sin embargo, los ecosistemas de bosques secos en Ecuador están en peligro de convertirse en una fuente de emisiones de carbono debido a la deforestación. A menudo falta información espacial, necesaria para cuantificar la pérdida potencial de carbono a la atmósfera. Esto se aplica particularmente a áreas remotas de accesibilidad limitada. Este estudio tiene como objetivo regionalizar las reservas de COS de un ecosistema de bosque seco pequeño y poco accesible en el suroeste de Ecuador mediante el uso de modelos de árbol de regresión reforzado (BRT). El nuevo muestreo en un enfoque de validación cruzada repetida anidada se aplicó para desarrollar modelos robustos para un conjunto de datos de 118 muestras con información predictiva limitada. Para seleccionar un conjunto óptimo de parámetros del modelo, se aplicó la optimización por evolución diferencial (DE) para el ajuste de parámetros. La selección de predictores se implementó utilizando el mismo algoritmo de optimización. Este estudio demuestra cómo se puede mejorar el rendimiento predictivo de los modelos BRT mediante la aplicación de un enfoque de optimización para el ajuste de parámetros y la selección de predictores. El rendimiento del modelo se mejoró en aproximadamente un 40% con respecto al R2. Aún así, los resultados también demostraron las dificultades de las aplicaciones de aprendizaje automático en áreas naturales pequeñas y altamente heterogéneas. Se asumió que factores muy variables o incluso aleatorios distorsionan la relación entre las variables predictoras y de respuesta.

However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables.

The gradient non-linearity (GNL) induced distortions in MRI; however, hinder the implementation of MRI-Linac system in image-guided radiotherapy where highly accurate geometry and anatomy of the target tumour is indispensable.To correct the geometric distortions in MR images, in particular, for the 1 Tesla (T) MRI-Linac system, a deep fully-connected neural network was proposed to automatically learn the intricate relationship between the undistorted (theoretical) and distorted (real) space. A data set, consisting of spatial samples acquired by phantom measurement that covers both inside and outside the working diameter of spherical volume (DSV), was utilised for training the neural network; which offers the ability to describe subtle deviations of the GNL field within the entire region of interest (ROI).The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on MR images of a three-dimensional (3D) phantom and the pelvic region of an adult volunteer scanned in the 1T MRI-Linac system. The experimental results showed that the severe geometric distortions within the entire ROI had been successfully corrected with an error less than the pixel size. Also, the presented network is highly efficient, which achieved significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency compared to existing methods.The feasibility of the presented deep neural network for characterising the GNL field deviations in the 1T MRI-Linac system was demonstrated in this study, which shows promise in facilitating the MRI-Linac system to be routinely implemented in real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy",Fast geometric distortion correction using a deep neural network: implementation for the 1 Tesla MRI-Linac system,10.1002/mp.14382,,,'Wiley',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies.

To investigate its practical value, a large, random test dataset—next to a small, non-random dataset—was developed, which better represents the real-world situation of scarce archaeological objects in different types of complex terrain. To reduce the number of false positives caused by specific regions in the research area, a novel approach has been developed and implemented called Location-Based Ranking. Experiments show that WODAN2.0 has a performance of circa 70% for barrows and Celtic fields on the small, non-random testing dataset, while the performance on the large, random testing dataset is lower: circa 50% for barrows, circa 46% for Celtic fields, and circa 18% for charcoal kilns. The results show that the introduction of Location-Based Ranking and bagging leads to an improvement in performance varying between 17% and 35%. However, WODAN2.0 does not reach or exceed general human performance, when compared to the results of a citizen science project conducted in the same research area.Archaeology of EuropeArchaeological science",Combining Deep Learning and Location-Based Ranking for Large-Scale Archaeological Prospection of LiDAR Data from The Netherlands,10.3390/ijgi9050293,https://core.ac.uk/download/388634407.pdf,,'MDPI AG',core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

However, the PSS providers in equipment industry are facing many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. One important challenge is how to fully collect and analyse the operational data of different equipment and diverse users in widely varied conditions to make the PSS providers create innovative equipment management services for their customers. To address this challenge, an active preventive maintenance approach for complex equipment is proposed. Firstly, a novel PSS operation mode was developed, where complex equipment is offered as a part of PSS and under exclusive control by the providers. Then, a solution of equipment preventive maintenance based on the operation mode was designed. A deep neural network was trained to predict the remaining effective life of the key components and thereby, it can pre-emptively assess the health status of equipment. Finally, a real-world industrial case of a leading CNC machine provider was developed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Higher accuracy for predicting the remaining effective life was achieved, which resulted in predictive identification of the fault features, proactive implementation of the preventive maintenance, and reduction of the PSS providers maintenance costs and resource consumption. Consequently, the result shows that it can help PSS providers move towards more ethical and sustainable directions. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

200793946,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Augmented reality (AR) is a new technology. Very few people know about its development, which began in 1970s from massive and primitive devices. Now AR is at the very peak of its improvement in the form of various software. Augmented reality has its application in the following devices: glasses, phones, tablets. Augmented reality works on the basis of two stages: object recognition and marker tracking. Recognition occurs on the basis of machine learning and tracking of markers by finding certain elements or special markers. The analogue of this principle of operation is SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization and Map Building). But the best results are achieved with the simultaneous use of two technologies. AR is involved in different areas: education, medicine, entertainment, military training. For education, three-dimensional 3D models are used, which are more visual for students and simplify their studies. In entertainment, AR has found a place for itself in various social networks in the form of masks (Snapchat), games (Pokemon GO) and others. In medicine, in addition to training, AR is used to visualize the internal organs of patients. Augmented reality has great potential for development in practical application in everyday life environments because it does not require high hardware characteristics.Дополненная реальность, или AR (augmented reality) – новая технология, развитие которой сейчас мало кому известно. Она начала развитие в 70-х годах прошлого века от массивных и примитивных устройств. Сейчас же находится на самом пике своего совершенствования в виде различных ПО. Дополненная реальность имеет свое применение в следующий устройствах: очки, телефоны, планшеты. AR работает на основе двух этапов: распознавание объектов и отслеживание маркеров. Распознавание происходит на базе машинного обучения, а отслеживание маркеров путем нахождения определенных элементов или специальных маркеров. Аналогом данного принципа работы является технология SLAM. Но наилучшие результаты достигаются при одновременном использовании двух технологий. AR заполняет все больше сфер. Для образования используют объемные 3D модели, которые являются более наглядными для студентов и упрощают их обучение. В развлечениях AR нашло себе место в различных социальных сетях в виде масок (Snapchat), игр (Pokemon GO) и других. В медицине, помимо обучения, AR используют для визуализации внутренних органов пациентов.

287192453,2020-02-10,"A true artificial intelligence (AI) system is something that ""learns"" from the data it stores,  in order to perform tasks and solve problems that typically require human intelligence - either with the help of a human expert or independently. The area of AI is an interdisciplinary field, which has been designated as a strategic area in the European Union (EU) approach and a key driver of economic development that can bring solutions to many social challenges and problems. Due to its nature and its tendency to be digitally advanced and smarter with analytics, the financial sector is one of the early adopters of AI and expects multiple benefits from its application, that is, the ability to provide better service in the shortest time possible and at a lower cost. AI in the financial sector is based on an understanding of the business needs of financial organizations, institutions and markets and the ability to connect with technological capabilities. They are powerful tools that completely transform this sector. The basic idea of this paper is to consider where the real value of AI in the financial sector is, i.e. what are the practical aspects and business implications of AI in the financial sector globally. It is common knowledge that evolving technologies have always had a strong impact on the sectors in which they are applied because they give them the opportunity to improve existing manufacturing processes, services, customer experiences, operate more efficiently, achieve cost savings, etc. The aim of this paper is to identify areas of application of AI in the financial sector, and to explore leading AI applications that are changing the financial ecosystem, transforming the financial sector and that have the potential to significantly improve many of its functions. The paper further highlights other implications of AI implementation in the financial sector such as employment - job creation and termination of existing AI-influenced employment, the scope and potential of application in developing countries, the problem of regulation and use in the best interests of man, and the importance of properly managing specific AI risks",FINANCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE FIFTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR,10.7251/ZREFIS1919067G,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/287192453.pdf,,"Ekonomski fakultet, Univerzitet u Istočnom Sarajevu",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Due to the physical properties of the materials, the change in the performance of the R2R processing equipment can easily cause deformation of the flexible film material, it is particularly important to predict the performance degradation of the processing equipment. Based on the accuracy and real-time requirements of performance degradation prediction, a PTS-FNN model for performance degradation prediction was proposed in this paper, which combines the Possibilistic C-Means (PCM) fuzzy clustering and Takagi–Sugeno Fuzzy Neural Network (TS-FNN). We also studied the PCM classification algorithm of input data of PTS-FNN model, the predecessor network of TS-FNN prediction model and the construction method of post-component network. Finally, the implementation process of PCM classification algorithm and TS-FNN prediction model were given. The R2R processing equipment health prediction experiment system was built and the PTS-FNN model experiment was carried out. The experimental results showed that the training time of PTS-FNN model was 50.37% less than the standard TS-FNN prediction model.

Infrastructures, working methods and skills are at the forefront of many debates and increasingly determine the future viability of entire industries. We have obviously embraced the permanent change with increasing acceleration. But: Where is the journey really going? Do communities constitute themselves exclusively in the interplay of hybrid realities? Are large amounts of data a threat or an opportunity? Can we process them at all or do we need fundamentally different tools and methods – such as visual analytics, virtual reconstruction, virtual engineering, virtual assistants and cooperative VR? Until recently, IT innovations were something for digital experts*, but hybrid communities in virtual realities are now part of everyday life. But what do managers have to prepare for? Digitalisation means new opportunities for openness, transparency and participation. Will this also lead to a revival of human-centred management activities?

The method consists in projecting the output of the internal layer of the network on a lower dimensional space, before training the output layer to learn the target task. Notably, we enforce a regularization constraint that leads to better generalization capabilities. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis.

202096241,2016-06-01T00:00:00,"Introduction/ Background
Liver steatosis is very important in transplantation pathology as it directly influences the graft dysfunction. Pretransplant donor biopsy materials are evaluated by the pathologists, and degree of steatosis, especially large droplet steatosis (LDS) which is described as lipid droplets with a diameter of at least 15 micron, is estimated under light microscope. But when doing so, there can be great intra- and inter-observer variability. In order to overcome this problem several automated systems and image analysis methods are used.
Aims
The most challenging issue for automated steatosis image analysis is to distinguish real oil droplets from sinusoidal regions. Although some morphometric features are employed to make this discrimination, whole feature space could not be represented for a fatty liver cell. In this study we have contributed a new approach, which tries to solve this discrimination issue with an artificial learning system.
Methods
Ten consecutive hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained, formalin fixed paraffin embedded donor liver biopsies, reported by 2 pathologist, were evaluated by a third pathologist and steatosis percentage was given as total and LDS by using the percentage of area occupied by lipid droplets to total biopsy area. Automated image analysis was performed on about 200 photographs taken to represent the whole biopsy at X20 magnification by Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 microscope using Kameram™ software and established as percentage of LDS to total biopsy area. Segmented positive (oil) and negative (non- oil) components are labeled by an expert pathologist and after some preprocesses they are fed to an Artificial Neural Network for training. We have used about 1000 droplets for training and 1500 droplets for performance evaluation. The proposed scheme is utilized to calculate liver fat ratio on digital images and the results are compared with expert’s opinions.
Results
There was great variation among pathologists and when compared to the automated analysis and pathologists were prone to overestimate the steatosis (Table 1). As this overestimation can lead to nonuse of the donor liver, the accurate assessment of the steatosis is critical. Since the biopsy is the gold standard for the assessment of steatosis, methodology of this examination should be as objective as possible. Our results show that automated assessment of liver steatosis is very useful in order not to loose donor livers, by overestimation. Automated image analysis used before were based on morphometric features of liver droplet regions, and use

Real Logic is a framework where learning from numerical data and logical reasoning are integrated using first order logic syntax. The symbols of the signature of Real Logic are interpreted in the data-space, i.e, on the domain of real numbers. The integration of learning and reasoning obtained in Real Logic allows us to formalize learning as approximate satisfiability in the presence of logical constraints, and to perform inference on symbolic and numerical data. After introducing a refined version of the formalism, we describe its implementation into Logic Tensor Networks which uses deep learning within Google's Tensorflow. We evaluate LTN on the task of classifying objects and their parts in images, where we combine state-of-the-art-object detectors with a part-of ontology. LTN outperforms the state-of-the-art on object classification, and improves the performances on part-of relation detection with respect to a rule-based baseline.Luciano Serafini; Ivan Donadello; Artur d'Avila GarcezSerafini, Luciano; Donadello, Ivan; Artur d'Avila, Garce",'Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)',Learning and Reasoning in Logic Tensor Networks: Theory and Application to Semantic Image Interpretation,10.1145/3019612.3019642,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

217779102,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"OBJECTIVE: 

Several trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy of maternal hydration (MH) in increasing amniotic-fluid-volume (AFV) in pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios or normohydramnos have been conducted. Unfortunately, no evidences support this intervention in routine-clinical-practice. The aim of this systematic-literature-review and meta-analysis was to collect all data regarding proposed strategies and their efficacy in relation to each clinical condition for which MH-therapy was performed with the aim of increasing amniotic-fluid (AF) and improving perinatal outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 

A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic-database MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane-Library in the time interval between 1991 and 2014. Following the identification of eligible trials, we estimated the methodological quality of each study (using QADAS-2) and clustered patients according to the following outcome measures: route of administration (oral versus intravenous versus combined), total daily dose of fluids administered (2000), duration of hydration therapy: (1 day, >1 day but 1 week), type of fluid administered (isotonic versus hypotonic versus combination).

RESULTS: 

In isolated-oligohydramnios (IO), maternal oral hydration is more effective than intravenous hydration and hypotonic solutions superior to isotonic solutions. The improvement in AFV appears to be time-dependent rather than daily-dose dependent. Regarding normohydramnios pregnancies, all strategies seem equivalent though the administration of hypotonic-fluid appears to have a slightly greater effect than isotonic-fluid. Regarding perinatal outcomes, data is fragmentary and heterogeneous and does not allow us to define the real clinical utility of MH.

CONCLUSIONS: 

Available data suggests that MH may be a safe, well-tolerated and useful strategy to improve AFV especially in cases of IO. In view of the numerous obstetric situations in which a reduced AFV may pose a threat, particularly to the fetus, the possibility of increasing AFV with a simple and inexpensive practice like MH-therapy may have potential clinical applications. Considering the various strategies of maternal hydration implemented in the treatment of IO, better results were observed when treatment was based on a combination of intravenous (for a period of 1 day) and oral (for a period of at least 14 days) hypotonic fluids (≥2000ml)",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',An Update on Maternal Hydration Strategies for Amniotic Fluid Improvement in Isolated Oligohydramnios and Normohydramnios: Evidence from a Systematic Review of Literature and Meta-Analysis,10.1371/journal.pone.0144334,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric features and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous expression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich substrate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one-to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive communication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selection algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences.

Methods: Adiponectin (Adipo), adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1), and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin protein concentration was evaluated by ELISA method. Data were analyzed using Studentâ��s t test and one-way ANOVA in SPSS 21 software. At oocyte retrieval, FF was aspirated and GCs were obtained from a pooled collection of FF per each patient. Results: PCR results showed expression of adiponectin, AdipoR1, AdipoR2, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in GCs. After controlling body mass index (BMI) values, qRT-PCR demonstrated a decreased expression of adiponectin system in GCs of PCOS patients compared to those in controls (p = 0.001). There was a strong positive correlation among AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression and also among FSH and LH receptor expression. (Both r = 0.8, p = 0.001). There were low levels of high molecular weight adiponectin in the serum of PCOS patients with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (30.19 Â± 4.3Â ng/ml) compared to the controls (48.47 Â± 5.9Â ng/ml) and in the FF of PCOS patients with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (7.86 Â± 1.44Â ng/ml) compared to the controls (14.22 Â± 2.01Â ng/ml; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Lower expression of adiponectin and its receptors in GCs might be an important manifestation in gonadotropin-stimulated PCOS patients which could influence the physiologic adiponectin roles such as interaction with insulin and LH in induction of GC gene expression.

One key challenge that increases the size of the exploration space is the number of views that one can generate from a single dataset, based on the use of multiple parameter values and exploration paths. Often, no such single view contains all needed insights. The question thus arises of how we can efficiently combine insights from multiple views of a dataset. We propose a set of techniques that considerably reduce the exploration effort for such situations, based on the explicit depiction of the view space, using a small multiple metaphor. We leverage this view space by offering interactive techniques that enable users to explicitly create, visualize, and follow their exploration path. This way, partial insights obtained from each view can be efficiently and effectively combined.

To monitor daily living activities, the use of a temperature, CO2, humidity sensors, and microphones are described in experiments in this study. The first part of the paper describes the use of CO2 concentration measurement for detecting and monitoring room's occupancy in SHC. In second part focuses this paper on the proposal of an implementation of Artificial Neural Network based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) for the detection of human presence in a room of SHC with the use of predictive calculation of CO2 concentrations from obtained measurements of temperature (indoor, outdoor) T-i, T-o and relative air humidity rH. Based on the long-term monitoring (1 month) of operational and technical functions (unregulated, uncontrolled) in an experimental Smart Home (SH), LMA was trained through the data picked up by the sensors of CO2, T and rH with the aim to indirectly predict CO2 leading to the elimination of CO2 sensor from the measurement process. Within the realized experiment, input parameters of the neuronal network and the number of neurons for LMA were optimized on the basis of calculated values of Root Mean Squared Error, the correlative coefficient (R) and the length of the measured training time ANN. With the use of the trained network ANN, we realized a strictly controlled short-term (11 h) experiment without the use of CO2 sensor. Experimental results verified high method accuracy (>95%) within the short-term and long-term experiments for learned ANN (1.6.2015-30.6.2015). For learned ANN (1.2.2014-27.2.2014) was verified worse method accuracy (>60%). The original contribution is a verification of a low-cost method for the detection of human presence in the real operating environment of SHC. In the third part of the paper is described the practical implementation of voice control of operating technical functions by the KNX technology in SHC by means of the in-house developed application HESTIA, intended for both the desktop system version and the mobile version of the Windows 10 operating system for mobile phones. The resultant application can be configured for any building equipped with the KNX bus system. Voice control implementation is an in-house solution, no third-party software is used here. Utilization of the voice communication application in SHC was proven on the experimental basis with the combination of measurement CO2 for ADL monitoring in SHC.Web of Science7art. no. 3",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Monitoring of the daily living activities in smart home care,10.1186/s13673-017-0113-6,https://core.ac.uk/download/161956269.pdf,"[{'title': 'Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences', 'identifiers': ['issn:2192-1962', '2192-1962']}]",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
202437912,2016-12-31,"AbstractPerformance debugging using program profiling and tracing for scientific workflows can be extremely difficult for two reasons. 1) Existing performance tools lack the ability to automatically produce global performance data based on local information from coupled scientific applications of workflows, particularly at runtime. 2) Profiling/tracing with static instrumentation may incur high overhead and significantly slow down science-critical tasks. To gain more insights on workflows we introduce a lightweight workflow monitoring infrastructure, WOW-MON (WOrkfloW MONitor), which enables user's access not only to cross-application performance data such as end-to-end latency and execution time of individual workflow components at runtime, but also to customized performance events. To reduce profiling overhead, WOW-MON uses adaptive selection of performance metrics based on machine learning algorithms to guide profilers collecting only metrics that have most impact on performance of workflows. Through the study of real scientific workflows (e.g., LAMMPS) with the help of WOWMON, we found that the performance of the workflows can be significantly affected by both software and hardware factors, such as the policy of process mapping and in-situ buffer size. Moreover, we experimentally show that WOWMON can reduce data movement for profiling by up to 54% without missing the key metrics for performance debugging",The Author(s).

203255060,2013-12-31,"AbstractThe use of mobile robots turns out to be interesting in activities where the action of human specialist is difficult or dangerous. Mobile robots are often used for the exploration in areas of difficult access, such as rescue operations and space missions, to avoid human experts exposition to risky situations. Mobile robots are also used in agriculture for planting tasks as well as for keeping the application of pesticides within minimal amounts to mitigate environmental pollution. In this paper we present the development of a system to control the navigation of an autonomous mobile robot through tracks in plantations. Track images are used to control robot direction by pre-processing them to extract image features. Such features are then submitted to a support vector machine and an artificial neural network in order to find out the most appropriate route. A comparison of the two approaches was performed to ascertain the one presenting the best outcome. The overall goal of the project to which this work is connected is to develop a real time robot control system to be embedded into a hardware platform.

With the use of optimization techniques, many different fields in the modern life have found solutions to their real-world based problems. In this context, classical optimization techniques have had an important popularity. But after a while, more advanced optimization problems required the use of more effective techniques. At this point, Computer Science took an important role on providing software related techniques to improve the associated literature. Today, intelligent optimization techniques based on Artificial Intelligence are widely used for optimization problems. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative study on the employment of classical optimization solutions and Artificial Intelligence solutions for enabling readers to have idea about the potential of intelligent optimization techniques. At this point, two recently developed intelligent optimization algorithms, Vortex Optimization Algorithm (VOA) and Cognitive Development Optimization Algorithm (CoDOA), have been used to solve some multidisciplinary optimization problems provided in the source book Thomas' Calculus 11th Edition and the obtained results have compared with classical optimization solutions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Find more at:</b></div><div><b>https://www.edusoft.ro/brain/index.php/brain/article/view/650 </b></div><div><br></div",,BRAIN Journal - Solving Optimization Problems via Vortex Optimization Algorithm and Cognitive Development Optimization Algorithm,10.6084/m9.figshare.5463565.v1,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
141695856,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Il ruolo del colore come strumento conoscitivo dell’archeologia, declinato all’interno delle operazioni di rilievo e rappresentazione, è un tema che copre differenti ambiti disciplinari ed applicativi, dalla conoscenza e dallo studio evolutivo della fisica del colore alla storia dei materiali e dei pigmenti, dal rilievo degli aspetti cromatici e materici alla relativa rappresentazione, fino ad arrivare alla visualizzazione digitale in ambienti con un livello di immersività ed interazione crescente. Ad oggi sono molteplici le sperimentazioni condotte e i risultati raggiunti in diversi ambiti applicativi, ma nonostante questo il rilievo e la rappresentazione del colore risultano spesso un collo di bottiglia nel processo conoscitivo del manufatto archeologico. Tale condizione deriva principalmente da due fattori, il primo di natura culturale e il secondo di origine metodologica. Da un lato la persistente distanza culturale fra le figure umanistiche e quelle tecniche e la difficile realizzazione di un reale approccio interdisciplinare, inteso come effettiva collaborazione biunivoca fra le parti, sulla quale lavorano da molti anni differenti associazioni a livello internazionale (CAA, VSMM, AIC, etc.), porta ad una mancanza di dialogo e di conseguenza alla mancata comprensione delle esigenze in fase analitica, arrivando ad ottenere risultati lacunosi o dati non affidabili ai fini delle ricerche. Dal punto di vista metodologico invece si evidenzia una divergenza sul ruolo e finalità delle tecniche di rilievo e di rappresentazione, siano esse tradizionali o digitali, all’interno del processo conoscitivo del manufatto, che può portare a risultati fini a sé stessi, autoreferenziali e non utili ai fini del raggiungimento di una conoscenza complessa del Bene.

Partendo da una analisi storica sul ruolo del colore nel rilievo e nella rappresentazione dei Beni Archeologici, l’articolo intende suggerire alcune riflessioni di carattere culturale e metodologico, ponendo al centro del confronto il rilievo geometrico e radiometrico come strumento di conoscenza della archeologia, in relazione alle finalità del progetto di rilievo e alla sua relativa rappresentazione. Verranno presentati alcuni casi studio a supporto di tali riflessioni e delle successive conclusioni che ne verranno tratte.The role of color as a cognitive instrument of archeology, deployed within relief and representation, is a theme that covers different disciplines and applications, from the knowledge and evolutionary study of color physics to the history of materials and pigments, from the highlight of the chromatic and material aspects to its representation, till the digital visualization in environments with a level of immersion and increasing interaction. To date, there are many experiments carried out and the results achieved in different application areas, but despite this the relief and color representation are often a bottleneck in the cognitive process of the archeological artifact. This condition is mainly due to two factors, the first of a cultural nature and the second related to methodological origin. On the one hand, the persisting cultural distance between humanistic and technical figures and the difficult realization of a real interdisciplinary approach, understood as effective biunivocal collaboration between the parties on which they have been working internationally for many years (CAA, VSMM, AIC , etc.) leads to a lack of dialogue and consequently to a lack in analytic requirements understanding as well, leading to poor results or unreliable data for research purposes. From the methodological point of view, however, there is a divergence on the role and purpose of the techniques of representation, whether traditional or digital, within the cognitive passage of the article, which can lead to self-referential, self-referential and non-objective results. useful to the achievement of a complex knowledge of the Cultural Heritage artifact.

Starting from an historical analysis of the role of color in the relief and representation of the Archaeological Heritage, the article intends to suggest some cultural and methodological reflections, focusing on geometric and radiometric relief as an instrument of knowledge of archeology, in relation to the purpose of the project and its relative representation. Some case studies will be presented to support such reflections and the subsequent conclusions",Associazione Italiana del Colore,Il ruolo del colore nella conoscenza dei Beni Archeologici,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
34996307,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"Efficient and reliable simulation tools are essential for progress in brain research. Since the early days of neuronal computing (Farley & Clark, 1954), a wide range of simulators have been developed, each specialized on one or few spatial and temporal scales (Brette et al., 2007). But the reliable and reproducible simulation of such complex systems as the brain is a very demanding challenge. Thus, the Computational Neuroscience community concentrated on a few reliable and widely used simulation tools in recent years. Neuronal network simulation is thus coming of age: Just as our colleagues in electrophysiology, we begin to base our work increasingly on the use of standard tools, with modifications and adaptations for our particular research, instead of building home-brew solutions from scratch. This concentration was not least the result of a series of large-scale EU funded projects, such as FACETS, BrainScaleS and the recently announced Human Brain Project.From its humble beginnings as a PhD-student project 20 years ago, the Neural Simulation Tool NEST (Gewaltig & Diesmann, 2007) saw its first incarnation as the SYNOD simulator in 1995 (Diesmann et al., 1995), leading to exciting results on synfire chains early on (Diesmann et al., 1999). By tightly coupling software development with computational neuroscience research (Kunkel et al., 2010), simulator technology evolved steadily, facilitating new scientific insight at (nearly) every step. Some key examples were parallelization (Morrison et al., 2005; Plesser et al., 2007), exact integration of model equations (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999), precise spike times in a time-driven simulator (Morrison et al., 2007; Hanuschkin et al., 2010), spike- time-dependent (Morrison et al., 2007) and neuro-modulated plasticity (Potjans et al., 2010), and a Topology module for spatially structured networks (Plesser & Enger, 2013). Streamlined data-structures (Kunkel et al., 2011) allow NEST to efficiently exploit the capabilities of some of the largest computers on Earth for simula- tions on the brain scale (Helias et al., 2012). Systematic quality assurance through testsuites (Eppler et al., 2009) and continuous integration technology (Zaytsev & Morrison, 2013) ensure simulator reliability (within limits). With a user-friendly Python-based interface (Eppler et al., 2008; Gewaltig et al., 2012), integration with PyNN (Davison et al., 2008) for simulator-independent scripting and MUSIC support (Djurfeldt et al., 2010) for integrated multi-scale simulation, NEST is a powerful simulation tool for brain-scale simulations today.NEST has been publicly available since 2004 and has been taught at summer schools and graduate courses since, training a generation of computational scientists. This has lead to a steady increase in computational neuroscience publications based on NEST simulations in recent years (see http://www.nest-initiative.org for a list), indicating that NEST is indeed establishing itself as a widely used tool for the simulation of large networks of (comparatively) simple model neurons.As of the NEST 2.0 release in 2012, NEST is available under the GNU Public License to ensure wide dissemination. The further development of NEST is chaperoned by the NEST Initiative, a non-for-profit organization incorporated in Ecublens, Switzerland, which is open for interested scientists. We are currently preparing to move NEST source code to a distributed version control system, allowing all NEST users ”real time” access to bug fixes and improvements, and to facilitate contributions by the NEST Community.In our demonstration, we will illustrate the capabilities and versatility of NEST. We will in particular focus on three complementary approaches to simulating large-scale cortical networks: A data-driven approach based on detailed connectivity information (based on data from the Blue Brain Project), constructive network generation, based on connectivity patterns (Potjans & Diesmann, 2012), and simulation of advanced 3D topological networks.AcknowledgementsWe present this work on behalf of the NEST Initiative.

We wish to create a system that will gather and process all data related to a particular e-learning course. To make monitoring easier, we will provide reliable statistics, behaviour groups and predicted results as a basis for an intelligent virtual tutor using the mentioned methods. This system will be described in this article. In this step of the project, we are clustering students by mining Moodle log data. A first objective is to define relevant clustering features. We will describe and evaluate our proposal. A second objective is to determine if our students show different learning behaviours. We will experiment whether there is an overall ideal number of clusters and whether the clusters show mostly qualitative or quantitative differences.

389872197,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Authorship attribution, conceived as the identification of the origin of a text be- tween different authors, has been a very active area of research in the scientific community mainly supported by advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and Computational Intelligence. This paradigm has been mostly addressed from a literary perspective, aiming at identifying the stylometric fea- tures and writeprints which unequivocally typify the writer patterns and allow their unique identification. On the other hand, the upsurge of social networking platforms and interactive messaging have undoubtedly made the anonymous ex- pression of feelings, the sharing of experiences and social relationships much easier than in other traditional communication media. Unfortunately, the popularity of such communities and the virtual identification of their users deploy a rich sub- strate for cybercrimes against unsuspecting victims and other forms of illegal uses of social networks that call for the activity tracing of accounts. In the context of one- to-one communications this manuscript postulates the identification of the sender of a message as a useful approach to detect impersonation attacks in interactive com- munication scenarios. In particular this work proposes to select linguistic features extracted from messages via NLP techniques by means of a novel feature selec- tion algorithm based on the dissociation between essential traits of the sender and receiver influences.

Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification. Digestion recovery of peptides was assessed and quantitative accuracy improved using heavy isotope labeled versions of the proteins as internal standards. Using the highly multiplexed assay, participating laboratories were able to precisely and reproducibly determine the levels of a series of analytes in blinded samples used to simulate an inter-laboratory clinical study of patient samples.

244639007,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Many fields of modern science require huge amounts of computation, and workflows are a very popular tool in e-Science since they allow to organize many small, simple tasks to solve big problems. They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhD research is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types. We are in the process of simulating policies, and we will validate our results by means of an implementation and real-world experiments with the KOALA-W workflow processing system.Distributed System",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Towards a Realistic Scheduler for Mixed Workloads with Workflows,10.1109/CCGrid.2015.74,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
335619155,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] The Audio-to-Score framework consists of two separate stages: pre- processing and alignment. The alignment is commonly solved through offline Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is a method to find the path over the distortion matrix with the minimum cost to determine the relation between the performance and the musical score times. In this work we propose a par- allel online DTW solution based on a client-server architecture. The current version of the application has been implemented for multi-core architectures (x86, x64 and ARM), thus covering either powerful systems or mobile devices. An extensive experimentation has been conducted in order to validate the software. The experiments also show that our framework allows to achieve a good score alignment within the real-time window by using parallel computing techniques.This work has been partially supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation and FEDER under Projects TEC2012-38142-C04-01, TEC2012-38142-C04-03, TEC2012-38142-C04-04, TEC2015-67387-C4-1-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-3-R, TEC2015-67387-C4-4-R, the European Union FEDER (CAPAP-H5 network TIN2014-53522-REDT), and the Generalitat Valenciana under Grant PROMETEOII/2014/003.Alonso-Jordá, P.; Cortina, R.; Rodríguez-Serrano, F.; Vera-Candeas, P.; Alonso-González, M.; Ranilla, J.

applications, but no single analysis pipeline can be
used in all cases. We review all of the major steps in
RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design,
quality control, read alignment, quantification of gene
and transcript levels, visualization, differential gene
expression, alternative splicing, functional analysis,
gene fusion detection and eQTL mapping. We
highlight the challenges associated with each step.
We discuss the analysis of small RNAs and the
integration of RNA-seq with other functional
genomics techniques. Finally, we discuss the outlook
for novel technologies that are changing the state of
the art in transcriptomics.The authors would like to thank Michael Love and Harold Pimentel for

275598738,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The bale collecting problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations in grain and other crops. Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable bale collecting planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16% from those obtained by previous heuristics.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government (research project AGL2010-15334).Gracia Calandin, CP.; Diezma Iglesias, B.; Barreiro Elorza, P.

275635798,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wellness state is affected by the habitability state of the domestic environment. Monitoring it can help to discover the causes of a low wellness levels aiding people in the improvement of their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a system to monitor the wellness state of people utilizing Likert¿s scale to determine the state of the user through an emoticon-based human¿computer interaction. The system is intended for domestic environments and measures the habitability conditions of the dwelling (such as temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise) employing sensors. An algorithm is designed in order to establish how to measure those conditions and to calculate the statistics that allows tracking their progress. The obtained information is presented to the user to compare his/her wellness state with the habitability conditions. Measures in a real domestic environment were performed in order to determine the configuration of our system. The energy efficiency of the algorithm provides an improvement between 99.36 and 99.62% in the energy consumption depending on the selected parameters.This work has been partially supported by the “Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación”, through the “Plan Nacional de I+D+i 2008–2011” and by the “Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte”, through the grand “Ayudas para contratos predoctorales de Formación del Profesorado Universitario FPU14/02953”.García-García, L.; Parra-Boronat, L.; Romero Martínez, JO.; Lloret, J.

Commercial ship routes joining Europe with other cultures are vivid examples of cultural interaction, while shipwrecks and submerged sites, unreachable to wide public are excellent samples that can benefit from immersive technologies, augmented and virtual reality. The projects aim to bring inherently unreachable underwater cultural heritage within digital reach of the wide public using virtual visits and immersive technologies. Apart from reusing existing 3D data of underwater shipwrecks and sites, with respect to ethics, rights and licensing, to provide a personalized dry visit to a museum visitor or augmented reality to the diver, it also emphasizes on developing pre- and after- encounter of the digital or physical museum visitor. The former one is implemented exploiting geospatial enabled technologies for developing a serious game of sailing over ancient Mediterranean and the latter for an underwater shipwreck excavation game. Both games are realized thought social media, in order to facilitate information exchange among users. The project supports dry visits providing immersive experience through VR Cave and 3D info kiosks on museums or through the web. Additionally, aims to significantly enhance the experience of the diver, visitor or scholar, using underwater augmented reality in a tablet and an underwater housing.

132714466,2017-09-01T00:00:00,"Bulk body motion may randomly occur during PET acquisitions introducing blurring, attenuation emission mismatches and, in dynamic PET, discontinuities in the measured time activity curves between consecutive frames. Meanwhile, dynamic PET scans are longer, thus increasing the probability of bulk motion. In this study, we propose a streamlined 3D PET motion-compensated image reconstruction (3D-MCIR) framework, capable of robustly deconvolving intra-frame motion from a static or dynamic 3D sinogram. The presented 3D-MCIR methods need not partition the data into multiple gates, such as 4D MCIR algorithms, or access list-mode (LM) data, such as LM MCIR methods, both associated with increased computation or memory resources. The proposed algorithms can support compensation for any periodic and non-periodic motion, such as cardio-respiratory or bulk motion, the latter including rolling, twisting or drifting. Inspired from the widely adopted point-spread function (PSF) deconvolution 3D PET reconstruction techniques, here we introduce an image-based 3D generalized motion deconvolution method within the standard 3D maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction framework. In particular, we initially integrate a motion blurring kernel, accounting for every tracked motion within a frame, as an additional MLEM modeling component in the image space (integrated 3D-MCIR). Subsequently, we replaced the integrated model component with a nested iterative Richardson-Lucy (RL) image-based deconvolution method to accelerate the MLEM algorithm convergence rate (RL-3D-MCIR). The final method was evaluated with realistic simulations of whole-body dynamic PET data employing the XCAT phantom and real human bulk motion profiles, the latter estimated from volunteer dynamic MRI scans. In addition, metabolic uptake rate K-i parametric images were generated with the standard Patlak method. Our results demonstrate significant improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and noise bias performance in both dynamic and parametric images. The proposed nested RL-3D-MCIR method is implemented on the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) open-source platform and is scheduled for public release. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given a reference imaging pipeline, or even human-adjusted pairs of images, we seek to reproduce the enhancements and enable real-time evaluation. For this, we introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by bilateral grid processing and local affine color transforms. Using pairs of input/output images , we train a convolutional neural network to predict the coefficients of a locally-affine model in bilateral space. Our architecture learns to make local, global, and content-dependent decisions to approximate the desired image transformation. At runtime, the neural network consumes a low-resolution version of the input image, produces a set of affine transformations in bilateral space, upsamples those transformations in an edge-preserving fashion using a new slicing node, and then applies those upsampled transformations to the full-resolution image. Our algorithm processes high-resolution images on a smartphone in milliseconds, provides a real-time viewfinder at 1080p resolution, and matches the quality of state-of-the-art approximation techniques on a large class of image operators. Unlike previous work, our model is trained off-line from data and therefore does not require access to the original operator at runtime.

In this work, we combine semantic web-mining and situated robot perception to develop a system capable of assigning semantic categories to regions of space. This is accomplished by looking at web-mined relationships between room categories and objects identified by a Convolutional Neural Network trained on 1000 categories.

203923069,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology.

379207905,2016-06-01T00:00:00,"The nature of scientific and technological data collection is evolving rapidly: data volumes and rates grow exponentially, with increasing complexity and information content, and there has been a transition from static data sets to data streams that must be analyzed in real time. Interesting or anomalous phenomena must be quickly characterized and followed up with additional measurements via optimal deployment of limited assets. Modern astronomy presents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital synoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray bursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially hazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning tools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy applications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a scientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the potentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the scientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys. Similar challenge arises in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using sensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems.

They represent a pattern, a paradigm, or an archetype to be wrapped around some kind of reality. Standards related to the Internet and its applications are explicit sets of requirements to be satisfied. Applying and implementing such standards reveals their capabilities to definitively satisfy their goals, beyond the authoritative principles they implicitly carry on. This paper explores questions and perspectives about the implementation of two accessibility standards in an e-learning platform, achieving inclusion both of the standards and their goals to provide accessibility. Their actual implementation in the LCMS ATutor reinforces considerations about inconsistencies and points out some aspects which may otherwise not be glaring.

19208033,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"We introduce AutoMoDe: a novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms. The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.SCOPUS: ar.jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',AutoMoDe: A novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms,10.1007/s11721-014-0092-4,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

At the end of the 80s, it was introduced a type of Neural Networks (NNs) inspired of the behavior of queueing networks named Random Neural Networks (RNN). The method has been successfully used in the Machine Learning community for solving many learning benchmark problems. In this paper, we implement in CUDA the gradient descent algorithm for optimizing a RNN model. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on two real benchmark problems about energy sources.

155745000,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Motivation: In genome-wide rate comparison studies, there is a big challenge for effective identification of an appropriate number of significant features objectively, since traditional statistical comparisons without multi-testing correction can generate a large number of false positives while multi-testing correction tremendously decreases the statistic power.   Results: In this study, we proposed a new exact test based on the translation of rate comparison to two binomial distributions. With modeling and real datasets, the exact binomial test (EBT) showed an advantage in balancing the statistical precision and power, by providing an appropriate size of significant features for further studies. Both correlation analysis and bootstrapping tests demonstrated that EBT is as robust as the typical rate-comparison methods, e.g. chi(2) test, Fisher&apos;s exact test and Binomial test. Performance comparison among machine learning models with features identified by different statistical tests further demonstrated the advantage of EBT. The new test was also applied to analyze the genome-wide somatic gene mutation rate difference between lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), two main lung cancer subtypes and a list of new markers were identified that could be lineage-specifically associated with carcinogenesis of LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Interestingly, three cilia genes were found selectively with high mutation rates in LUSC, possibly implying the importance of cilia dysfunction in the carcinogenesis.

The method consists in projecting the output of the internal layer of the network on a lower dimensional space, before training the output layer to learn the target task. Notably, we enforce a regularization constraint that leads to better generalization capabilities. We evaluate the performances of our approach on several benchmark tests, using different techniques to train the readout of the network, achieving superior predictive performance when using the proposed framework. Finally, we provide an insight on the effectiveness of the implemented mechanics through a visualization of the trajectory in the phase space and relying on the methodologies of nonlinear time-series analysis.

146965571,2015-09,"There is an increasing need in biology and clinical medicine to robustly and reliably measure tens-to-hundreds of peptides and proteins in clinical and biological samples with high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and repeatability. Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification.

Materials and Methods: Essence extraction was conducted using water distillation method from Z. multiflora, L. nobilis leafs and C. nobile capitals by Clevenger apparatus. The combination effects of the essences were studied on E. coli in different dosages using Qualitek-4 software and fraction of the full factorial statistical method. Essences interactions and the contribution of each essence were evaluated on inhibition of E. coli growth.

Results: MIC values was determined for Z. multiflora, L. nobilis and C. nobile essences as 0.01, 0.1 and 0.05 mg ml-1, also MBC values was 0.1, 0.5 and 0.5 mg ml-1, respectively. Z. multiflora essence dosages showed the highest percentage of antibacterial effect (64. 2%) on E. coli, while the antibacterial effect was evaluated 13.54% and 6.89% for L. nobilis and C. nobile essences, respectively. In optimum conditions, all three essences dosages should be equal to 1 mg. mL-1 and the percentage of bacterial growth inhibition was determined by 72.76% whereas it has 81.8% consistency with real results at optimum conditions (60%). The maximum interaction was observed between Z. multiflora and C. nobile essences dosages with 33.44% severity index.

53520855,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"In recent years there has been a growing interest in Bayesian inference in numerous scientific disciplines. Structural equation models (SEM) are an important tool in the social and behavioural sciences to evaluate the structure of a model with latent and observed variables. However, the use of a Bayesian approach (BA) in this field is still underexplored. In this work, we illustrate the advantages of using the BA in a relevant SEM sub- model, i.e., confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Specifically, the goals are to (1) compare the traditional maximum likelihood approach (MLA) with the BA in terms of parameter estimation and fit indices; (2) show how the BA allows to estimate further models that may result unidentified via the classical approach, but may better reflect the underlying psychological theory; and (3) present BA-based techniques for model diagnostic in terms of the distribution of estimated parameters as well as single case influence. To address the first aim, a simulation study was performed. Starting from a baseline two-correlated factor model, we manipulated sample size and effect size of a potential cross-loading for a specific item. For each condition, we estimated 2 bayesian CFAs (one including and one excluding the cross- loading) and 2 ML CFAs. Next, a bayesian CFA on a real case-study is presented. The magnitude of cross-loadings and residual correlations were simultaneously evaluated according to different theoretical models through different parameter prior specifications. The most plausible model was selected using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Parameter posterior distributions and predictive posterior distribution of the observed data were used to examine model fit. All analyses were conducted using free software (i.e., R in combination with JAGS). Differences and similarities between the BA and MLA will be discussed. Overall, the formalization of model parameters in terms of prior probability distributions, instead of the less realistic parameters presence-or-absence formalization, provided a more flexible and informative evaluation of the latent structure of the observed data. To conclude, we will briefly review potential applications of the BA to the broader context of structural equation models",,A Bayesian approach to confirmatory factor analysis: Moving beyond dichotomous thinking,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
74313689,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Nowadays space exploration is moving further towards robotic missions with in situ analysis and planetary samples return. Among others, the safe, re-targetable and precise landing is a mandatory requirement which entails a strong level of on board autonomy to make the maneuver timely, effective and robust, no matter of the Earth-planet distance, which may significantly affect the communication chain delays, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the safe touchdown success. Moreover, planetary surface morphology is often roughly characterized before being in the natural object proximity. Therefore while the landing site is precisely identified according to its scientific and commercial benefits, it turns out to be largely affected by uncertainty on its surrounding morphology and hazardousness, an awareness that is needed to smoothly drive the lander to its target. It is straightforward that an autonomous landing system capable of safe pinpoint landings would improve in situ exploration missions' flexibility and performance. Several building blocks constitute an autonomous landing system, among which one of the most critical is hazard detector. This system works on data fused from the on board Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) sensors, being those typically optical sensors: LIDARs allow directly reconstructing the 3D terrain maps, being heavy and expensive sensors; cameras, either in mono or stereo configuration, adopt simple image processing techniques to recognize hazards but they typically struggle in non-sharp terrain features, such as smooth slopes, recognition. The paper described the algorithm implemented at Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi), based on single camera data acquisition and image processing through a tailored Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture: the algorithm, based on single camera, outputs the hazard map, together with the target landing site. At the time being, the algorithm has been tested and verified with real images both from NASA - LROC and Rosetta NAVCam missions. The tool is computationally light enough to run on board during the landing phase and it is cost effective and power efficient. To further increase this technology readiness level, the algorithm is being tested on a dedicated ground facility under developed at PoliMi, which includes real hardware in the loop for proximity maneuvering testing. The paper critically discusses the latest results obtained by enhancing neural network architectures and assesses its performance in various environmental conditions.

Objectives: We examined whether the SEB could exert its growth inhibitory effects on glioblastoma cells partially through the manipulation of a key tumor growth factor termed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²). Materials and Methods: A human primary glioblastoma cell line, U87, was treated with different concentrations of SEB. The cell quantity was measured by the MTT assay at different exposure times. For molecular assessments, total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from either non-treated or SEB-treated cells. Subsequently, the gene expression of TGF-Î² transducers, smad2/3, at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, was analyzed via a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the SYBR Green method. Significant differences between cell viability and gene expression levels were determined (Prism 5.0 software) using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Results: We reported that SEB could effectively down-regulate smad2/3 expression in glioblastoma cells at concentrations as quantity as 1 Âµg/mL and 2 Âµg/mL (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The SEB concentrations effective at regulating smad2/3 expression were correlated with those used to inhibit the proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Our results also showed that SEB was able to decrease smad2/3 expression at the mRNA level in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Conclusions: We suggested that SEB could represent an agent that can significantly decrease smad2/3 expression in glioblastoma cells, leading to moderate TGF-Î² growth signaling and the reduction of tumor cell proliferation.

187742851,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"A key requirement of autonomous vehicles is the capability to safely navigate in their environment. However, outside of controlled environments, safe navigation is a very difficult problem. In particular, the real-world often contains both complex 3D structure, and dynamic obstacles such as people or other vehicles. Dynamic obstacles are particularly challenging, as a principled solution requires planning trajectories with regard to both vehicle dynamics, and the motion of the obstacles. Additionally, the real-time requirements imposed by obstacle motion, coupled with real-world computational limitations, make classical optimality and completeness guarantees difficult to satisfy. We present a unified optimization-based motion planning and control solution, that can navigate in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. By combining optimal and receding-horizon control, with temporal multi-resolution lattices, we can precompute optimal motion primitives, and allow real-time planning of physically-feasible trajectories in complex environments with dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the framework by solving difficult indoor 3D quadcopter navigation scenarios, where it is necessary to plan in time. Including waiting on, and taking detours around, the motions of other people and quadcopters.This work was partially supported by FFI/VINNOVA, the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) project Symbicloud, the ELLIIT Excellence Center at Linköping-Lund for Information Technology, Swedish Research Council (VR) Linnaeus Center CADICS, and the National Graduate School in Computer Science, Sweden (CUGS).</p",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Receding-Horizon Lattice-based Motion Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,10.1109/CDC.2018.8618964,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
81111337,2016-12-31,"AbstractTransferring predictive microbial models from research into real world food manufacturing or risk assessment applications is still a challenge for members of the food safety modelling community. Such knowledge transfer could be facilitated if publicly available food safety model repositories would exist.This research therefore aimed at identification of missing resources hampering the establishment of community driven food safety model repositories. Existing solutions in related scientific disciplines like Systems Biology and Data Mining were analyzed.On the basis of this analysis, some factors which would promote the establishment of community driven model repositories were identified – among them: a standardized information exchange format for models and rules for model annotation. As a consequence a proposal for a Predictive Modelling in Food Markup Language (PMF-ML) together with a prototypic implementation on the basis of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has been developed. In addition the adoption of MIRIAM guidelines for model annotation is proposed. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed strategy, existing predictive models previously published in the scientific literature were re-implemented using an open source software tool called PMM-Lab. The models are made publicly available in the first community Food Safety Model Repository called openFSMR (https://sites.google.com/site/openfsmr/).This work illustrates that a standardized information exchange format for predictive microbial models can be established by adoption of resources from Systems Biology.

El sistema de control diseñado proporciona un buen seguimiento de la tensión de referencia óptima, a la cual se genera la máxima potencia. El sistema fotovoltaico está conectado a una carga a través de un convertidor CC/CC elevador (boost). El controlador FLC proporciona el ciclo de trabajo (D) apropiado al convertidor CC/CC para que el sistema PV genere la máxima potencia. También se propone un método de análisis de la estabilidad del sistema en lazo cerrado. Aunque el análisis de la estabilidad está basado en la metodología de Lyapunov, es un análisis semicualitativo, ya que no se dispone de un modelo del sistema en lazo cerrado para realizar un análisis analítico. Tanto los resultados de simulación como las pruebas experimentales sobre un sistema PV comercial muestran que el FLC proporciona un buen seguimiento del punto de máxima potencia (MPP). Finalmente, se ha evaluado el funcionamiento del FLC sobre un sistema PV real formado por unas placas fotovoltaicas comerciales Atersa modelo A55. Para realizar las pruebas experimentales se ha implementado la estrategia de control sobre un procesador digital de señal DS1104 de dSPACE. Los resultados experimentales obtenidos demuestran la validez del esquema de control FLC sobre un sistema fotovoltaico comercial.[EN] This paper presents a new control scheme for a standalone photovoltaic (PV) system based on a fuzzy-logic (FLC). The proposed control system provides good tracking for the optimal reference voltage, at which the maximum power generation is obtained. The photovoltaic system is connected to a load through a DC/DC boost converter. The FLC controller provides the appropriate duty cycle (D) to the DC/DC converter in order to get the maximum power from the PV system. A method for the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is also proposed. The stability analysis is based on the Lyapunov methods and is a semi-qualitative analysis because there is no closed loop system model available for the analytical analysis. Both simulation results and experimental tests on a real PV system show that the FLC provides good tracking for the maximum power point (MPP).Finally, the performance of the FLC on a real PV system consisting of a commercial solar panels Atersa model A55 is analyzed. To perform the experimental tests the proposed control strategy has been implemented on the dSPACE digital signal processor model DS1104. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed FLC control scheme over a commercial photovoltaic system.Este trabajo ha sido realizado parcialmente gracias al apoyo de la Universidad del País Vasco (GIU13/41 y UFI11/07) y al proyecto TEP-6124 financiado por la Junta de AndalucíaFarhat, M.; Barambones, Ó.; Ramos, JA.; Durán, E.; Andújar, JM.

43491761,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

Animals are naturally motivated towards playing. Playful environments are, therefore, a promising scenario in which to start developing animal-centered ecosystems, and there are plenty of circumstances where playful environments could help to improve animals  well-being. However, developing a custom system for each possible context remains unfeasible, and more appealing solutions are required. If playful environments were equipped with intelligent capabilities, they could learn from the animals  behavior and automatically adapt themselves to the animals  needs and preferences by creating engaging playful activities for different purposes. Hence, this work will define intelligent playful environments for animals and explain how Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can contribute to create adaptable playful experiences for animals in order to improve their quality of life.This work was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under the National R&D&I Program within the project CreateWorlds (TIN2010-20488).

327184530,,"Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Tensor Voting Techniques and Applications in Mobile Trace Inference,10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2512380.,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Lattice Reduction aided MIMO detectors have been demonstrated to offer a promising gain by providing near-optimal performance. This paper presents a C-programmable ASIP baseband processor, for near-optimal MIMO detection targeting a 4×4 LTE system. The detector supports multiple MIMO detection modes, with both hard and soft output. In order to improve implementation efficiency, the previously reported MIMO detection algorithm Multi-Tree Selective Spanning Detector (MTSS) is modified to use orthogonal real-valued decomposition (ORVD). Afterwards, a low-complexity log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) improvement technique called counter-ML bit-flipping algorithm is proposed. The proposed LLR generation algorithm has been designed to take advantage of MTSS, by maximizing the reuse of computations. Performance of the proposed solution can be tuned ranging from SIC to near-ML to near-MAP. The baseband processor is designed using 40 nm process technology with an equivalent gate-count (GE) of 68.41 kGE. Operating at 600 MHz for a 4×4 QAM-64 LTE system, the processor delivers peak-throughputs of 3.6 Gbps and 2.05 Gbps in case of hard and soft output MIMO detection, with 13.03 mW and 22.99 mW respective power consumption. The corresponding energy efficiency is 3.61 pJ/bit and 11.17 pJ/bit. In terms of energy efficiency, the proposed reconfigurable solution is comparable to recently reported ASIC MIMO detectors, while providing multiple-modes of operation and the flexilibility of C-programming.status: publishe",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',An energy-efficient reconfigurable ASIP supporting multi-mode MIMO detection,10.1007/s11265-015-0972-x,,"[{'title': 'Journal of Signal Processing Systems', 'identifiers': ['issn:1939-8018', 'issn:1939-8115', '1939-8018', '1939-8115']}]",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
185663536,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"A key requirement of autonomous vehicles is the capability to safely navigate in their environment. However, outside of controlled environments, safe navigation is a very difficult problem. In particular, the real-world often contains both complex 3D structure, and dynamic obstacles such as people or other vehicles. Dynamic obstacles are particularly challenging, as a principled solution requires planning trajectories with regard to both vehicle dynamics, and the motion of the obstacles. Additionally, the real-time requirements imposed by obstacle motion, coupled with real-world computational limitations, make classical optimality and completeness guarantees difficult to satisfy. We present a unified optimization-based motion planning and control solution, that can navigate in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. By combining optimal and receding-horizon control, with temporal multi-resolution lattices, we can precompute optimal motion primitives, and allow real-time planning of physically-feasible trajectories in complex environments with dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the framework by solving difficult indoor 3D quadcopter navigation scenarios, where it is necessary to plan in time. Including waiting on, and taking detours around, the motions of other people and quadcopters.This work was partially supported by FFI/VINNOVA, the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP) funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) project Symbicloud, the ELLIIT Excellence Center at Linköping-Lund for Information Technology, Swedish Research Council (VR) Linnaeus Center CADICS, and the National Graduate School in Computer Science, Sweden (CUGS).</p",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Receding-Horizon Lattice-based Motion Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,10.1109/CDC.2018.8618964,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389907284,2015-12-17T00:00:00,"Objective. This paper presents the selective particle swarm optimization and results of it applying to solve a problem of the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously for a real distribution system with 3 substations, 37 feeders, 274 buses, 284 branches and 11 normally open switches located in the eastern part of Mariupol city. Technique. Selective particle swarm optimization as a simple modification of the binary particle swarm optimization to search in a selected decision space was used for solving the aforesaid problem formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer combinatorial nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a plenty of test systems and real schemes with the different number of buses were used and selective particle swarm optimization was compared to another modern heuristic and artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony search algorithm, fuzzy-reasoning approach, etc.). MATLAB R2010a was applied as a computational tool to realize the proposed algorithm for modeling of the real large-scale distribution system. Before starting simulation, the long-term measurements (during one week) of the active and reactive power, power factor, voltage distortion and unbalance were made by Fluke 435 power quality analyzer on the four feeders with the highest active power losses and voltage drop. Results. Simulation results before and after optimization demonstrated an effectiveness of the selective particle swarm optimization in reducing the both active power and energy losses, improving the voltage quality and receiving the total annual saving. A comparative study of the three abovementioned techniques (capacitor placement, reconfiguration and reconductoring) to optimize a performance of the large-scale distribution system was executed. Scientific novelty. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for an optimization procedure of the real large-scale distribution system to find the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously accounting for technical constraints (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits, maximum total harmonic distortion limit and maximum permissible total size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). Practical value. For investigated distribution system, applying of all three optimization techniques simultaneously with THD constraint would be reduce the active power losses from 7.4 % to 3.5 % and energy losses – from 5 % to 2.38 % (approximately twice). In this case, the total annual saving would be about $700000 and the total saving for remaining period – about $4.8 million.Цель. В работе приведены селективный метод роя частиц и результаты его применения для решения проблемы совместной оптимизации мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников реальной распределительной сети, которая содержит 3 подстанции, 37 фидеров, 274 узла, 284 ветви и 11 нормально разомкнутых коммутационных аппаратов, и расположена в восточной части города Мариуполь. Методика. Селективный метод роя частиц, представляющий собой простую модификацию бинарного метода роя частиц, предназначенную для поиска в выбранном пространстве решений, был использован для решения вышеуказанной проблемы, сформулированной как проблема многокритериальной частично целочисленной комбинаторной нелинейной оптимизации с ограничениями в виде равенств и неравенств. Для подтверждения эффективности предложенного алгоритма были использованы многочисленные тестовые и реальные схемы с различным количеством узлов, а селективный метод роя частиц сравнили с другими современными эвристическими методами и методами искусственного интеллекта (например, имитация отжига, генетические алгоритмы, алгоритм колонии муравьёв, нечёткая логика и др.). Чтобы реализовать предложенный алгоритм для моделирования реальной разветвлённой сети, в качестве вычислительного средства была использована среда MATLAB R2010a. Перед началом моделирования с помощью анализатора качества электроэнергии Fluke 435 на четырёх фидерах с наибольшими потерями активной мощности и падением напряжения были проведены длительные (в течение одной недели) измерения активной и реактивной мощности, коэффициента мощности, несинусоидальности и несимметрии напряжений. Результаты. Результаты моделирования до и после оптимизации продемонстрировали эффективность применения селективного метода роя частиц для снижения потерь активной мощности и электроэнергии, улучшения качества напряжения и получения суммарной годовой экономии. Выполнено сравнительное исследование трёх приведенных выше методов оптимизации параметров разветвлённой распределительной сети (установка батарей конденсаторов, реконфигурация и замена сечений проводников). Научная новизна. Предложенный алгоритм был реализован для оптимизации параметров реальной разветвлённой распределительной сети с целью совместного определения оптимальных мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников, учитывая технические ограничения (максимально допустимый ток, максимально и минимально допустимые напряжения, максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению и максимально допустимое значение суммарной установленной мощности батарей конденсаторов) и эксплуатационные ограничения (отсутствие отключенных нагрузок и радиальная структура сети). Практическая значимость. Применение для исследуемой распределительной сети всех трёх методов оптимизации одновременно с учётом ограничения на максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению позволило бы снизить потери активной мощности с 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а потери электроэнергии – с 5 % до 2,38 % (примерно в 2 раза). В этом случае суммарная годовая экономия составила бы около 700000 $, а суммарная экономия за остаточный период – около 4,8 млн. $.Мета. В роботі наведені селективний метод рою частинок та результати його застосування щодо вирішення проблеми спільної оптимізації місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників реальної розподільної мережі, яка містить 3 підстанції, 37 фідерів, 274 вузли, 284 гілки та 11 нормально розімкнених комутаційних апаратів і розташована у східній частині міста Маріуполь.Методика. Селективний метод рою частинок, який є простою модифікацією бінарного методу рою частинок, призначеною для пошуку у обраному просторі розв'язань, був застосований щодо вирішення зазначеної вище проблеми, сформульованої як проблема багатокритеріальної частково цілочислової комбінаторної нелінійноїоптимізації з обмеженнями у вигляді рівностей та нерівностей. Для підтвердження ефективності запропонованого алгоритму були використані численні тестові та реальні схеми з різною кількістю вузлів, а селективний метод рою частинок був порівняний з іншими сучасними евристичними методами та методами штучного інтелекту (наприклад, імітація відпалу, генетичні алгоритми, алгоритм колонії мурашів, нечітка логіка та ін.). Щоби реалізувати запропонований алгоритм для моделювання реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі, у якості обчислювального засобу було застосовано середовище MATLAB R2010a. Перед початком моделювання за допомогою аналізатору якості електроенергії Fluke 435 на чотирьох фідерах з найбільшими втратами активної потужності та спадом напруги були виконані тривалі (протягом одного тижня) вимірювання активної та реактивної потужності, коефіцієнту потужності, несинусоїдності та несиметрії напруг. Результати. Результати моделювання до та після оптимізації продемонстрували ефективність застосування селективного методу рою частинок для зниження втрат активної потужності та електроенергії, покращення якості напруги та отримання сумарної річної економії. Виконано порівняльне дослідження трьох зазначених вище методів оптимізації параметрів розгалуженої розподільної мережі (встановлення батарей конденсаторів, реконфігурація та заміна перерізів провідників). Наукова новизна. Запропонований алгоритм був реалізований для оптимізації параметрів реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі з метою спільного знаходження оптимальних місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників, враховуючи технічні обмеження (максимально припустимий струм, максимально та мінімально припустимі напруги, максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою та максимально припустиме значення сумарної встановленої потужності батарей конденсаторів) та експлуатаційні обмеження (відсутність вимкнених навантажень та радіальна структура мережі). Практична значимість. Застосування для досліджуваної розподільної мережі всіх трьох методів оптимізації разом з урахуванням обмеження на максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою дозволило би знизити втрати активної потужності з 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а втрати електроенергії – з 5 % до 2,38 % (приблизно у 2 рази). У цьому випадку сумарна щорічна економія склала би приблизно 700000 $, а сумарна економія за залишковий період – приблизно 4,8 млн. $",Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Acad.

185549869,2018,"The characterization of the melting layer (ML) is an important task for operational radar meteorology. Melting layer identification may be used to establish distances at which radar rainfall estimates become affected by melting hydrometeors, with benefits for operational hydrometeor classification, as snowfall, freezing rain and liquid precipitation. Consequently, this yields a significant performance improvement in radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) on ground. Furthermore, knowledge of the ML location is also important for microphysical cloud characterization and the evaluation of icing potential. Several studies and algorithms exist in literature for characterizing ML through radar measurement signature, the most popular being the increase in the radar reflectivity factor known as bright. For dual polarization radar, ML detection can be pursued using specific signatures of dual polarization measurements, such as differential reflectivity ZDR, co-polar correlation coefficient \rhoHV , specific differential phase KDP, and linear depolarization ratio LDR that exhibit well-pronounced ML signatures both in stratiform and even in convective situations. Moreover, ML and rainfall have a strong influence on satellite links signals, as they are attenuated due to the presence of hydrometeors along the propagation path. In stratiform precipitation systems, the ML is the upper limit of the rainfall column height that is responsible of the attenuation of radio signals. Therefore, ML climatology is proficiently used for designing satellites links relative to a specific area. Very recently, a new X-band Doppler, dual-polarization weather radar system has been installed in Florence funded by the Tuscany Region Government within the NEFOCAST project. The latter investigates a new concept system that aims at providing real time precipitation maps trough the attenuation measurements collected by a dense population of new-generation interactive satellite terminals (called SmartLNB, Smart Low-Noise Block converter). A number of SmartLNB has been deployed in the Tuscany region and a test bed has been established in cooperation with the schools of the Florence Metropolitan city. In the present study, the potential of the new weather radar system is investigated for characterizing the ML in terms of height and thickness under different meteorological conditions and cloud systems. Measurements collected in the RangeHeight Indicator (RHI) scan mode along the direction to the Eutelsat 10A satellite (used for the experimental campaign of the NEFOCAST project) have been analysed with the simultaneous attenuation estimation obtained by the SmartLNBs with radar coverage during selected precipitative events. Statistical analyses have been performed based on both weather radar and SmartLNB measurements, supplemented by ancillary observations from some rain gauges (both impact and tipping-bucket types) co-located with SmartLNBs. In addition, a C-band radar system (Polar 55C) located in Rome has also been used for this work. Polar 55C dual polarization measurements have been analysed with respect to co-located SmartLNBs and laser disdrometer. The results of this analysis highlight the effects of ML on radio signal attenuation, as the total attenuation of signal increases also with the increase of ML vertical thickness. Therefore, the characterization of the vertical profile of precipitation is mandatory for implementing accurate QPE on ground, both from radars and satellite links",'Wageningen University and Research',Studies of the melting layer of precipitative systems using X-band dual polarization weather radar and SmartLNB network,10.18174/454537,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Hearing loss, a partial or total inability to hear, is one of the most commonly reported disabilities. A hearing test can be carried out by an audiologist to assess a patient’s auditory system. However, the procedure requires an appointment, which can result in delays and practitioner fees. In addition, there are often challenges associated with the unavailability of equipment and qualified practitioners, particularly in remote areas. This paper presents a novel idea that automatically identifies any hearing impairment based on a cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition approach. The proposed system uses an adaptive filter bank with weighted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for feature extraction. The adaptive filter bank implementation is inspired by the principle of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio that is aware of its environment and adapts to statistical variations in the input stimuli by learning from the environment. Comparative performance evaluation demonstrates the potential of our automated hearing test method to achieve comparable results to the clinical ground truth, established by the expert audiologist’s tests. The overall absolute error of the proposed model when compared with the expert audiologist test is less than 4.9 dB and 4.4 dB for the pure tone and speech audiometry tests, respectively. The overall accuracy achieved is 96.67% with a hidden Markov model (HMM). The proposed method potentially offers a second opinion to audiologists, and serves as a cost-effective pre-screening test to predict hearing loss at an early stage. In future work, authors intend to explore the application of advanced deep learning and optimization approaches to further enhance the performance of the automated testing prototype considering imperfect datasets with real-world background noise.Published versio",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Cognitively inspired feature extraction and speech recognition for automated hearing loss testing,10.1007/s12559-018-9607-4,https://core.ac.uk/download/286356367.pdf,"[{'title': 'Cognitive Computation', 'identifiers': ['issn:1866-9964', '1866-9956', '1866-9964', 'issn:1866-9956']}]",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Un forte sdegno investiva inoltre una classe politica percepita come altamente corrotta in un Paese in crisi (nel 2009 \u2013 c\u2019erano stati ben 730 processi pendenti a carico di amministratori pubblici, con il primato del PSOE con 264 casi di corruzione aperti, seguito dai 200 casi del PP).

Il percorso partito dalla manifestazione a Puerta del Sol del 15 maggio 2011, dal presidio permanente (Acampada) alla rete nazionale di Democracia Real Ya, si sviluppa nella scelta di competere alle europee con un proprio partito, arrivando ai primi successi elettorali di Podemos, sino ai consensi alle amministrative del 24M.

A strong indignation also invested a political class perceived as highly corrupt in a country in crisis (in 2009 - there were 730 pending trials against public officials, with the primacy of the PSOE with 264 corruption cases opened, followed by 200 cases of PP). Already in June 2011, there was the Europeanization of protest and a changing in the social and  generational base of the movement. The reported problems are exacerbated by the Rajoy government. They blame the lack of credibility of the political class, subservient to the policies imposed by the decision-making centers of international capitalism that make similar the majority and the opposition choices. Claiming the right of operating different choices, Podemos propose new models aspiring to stop the degradation process of representative democracy through the introduction of forms of participatory and deliberative democracy, against the bipartisanship the major parties accused of having ""kidnapped democracy"".

In this paper, we propose an ontology (VIS4ML) for a subarea of VA, namely ""VA-assisted ML"". The purpose of VIS4ML is to describe and understand existing VA workflows used in ML as well as to detect gaps in ML processes and the potential of introducing advanced VA techniques to such processes. Ontologies have been widely used to map out the scope of a topic in biology, medicine, and many other disciplines. We adopt the scholarly methodologies for constructing VIS4ML, including the specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, and validation of ontologies. In particular, we reinterpret the traditional VA pipeline to encompass model-development workflows. We introduce necessary definitions, rules, syntaxes, and visual notations for formulating VIS4ML and make use of semantic web technologies for implementing it in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). VIS4ML captures the high-level knowledge about previous workflows where VA is used to assist in ML. It is consistent with the established VA concepts and will continue to evolve along with the future developments in VA and ML. While this ontology is an effort for building the theoretical foundation of VA, it can be used by practitioners in real-world applications to optimize model-development workflows by systematically examining the potential benefits that can be brought about by either machine or human capabilities.

154803302,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Many tasks involve the fine manipulation of objects despite limited visual feedback. In such scenarios, tactile and proprioceptive feedback can be leveraged for task completion. We present an approach for real-time haptic perception and decision-making for a haptics-driven, functional contour-following task: the closure of a ziplock bag. This task is challenging for robots because the bag is deformable, transparent, and visually occluded by artificial fingertip sensors that are also compliant. A deep neural net classifier was trained to estimate the state of a zipper within a robot&#x0027;s pinch grasp.

The learned C-MAB policy was tested with novel ziplock bag scenarios and contours (wire, rope). Importantly, this work contributes to the development of reinforcement learning approaches that account for limited resources such as hardware life and researcher time.

Panels were analyzed simultaneously, blinded to sample allocation, at 4-month intervals. In addition, 302 random blood samples from both trials carried out in Bolivia were sent to Core Lab for retesting analysis. The analysis of proficiency testing panels gave 100% of accordance (within laboratory agreement) and concordance (between laboratory agreement) for all T. cruzi stocks at 100 par. eq./mL; whereas their values ranged from 71 to 100% and from 62 to 100% at 1 and 10 par. eq./mL, respectively, depending on the T. cruzi stock.

275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.

275634114,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay communications networks have emerged as a new paradigm for implementing distributed services in microgrids due to their potential benefits: they are robust, scalable, fault-tolerant, and they can route messages even with a large number of nodes which are frequently entering or leaving from the network. However, current P2P systems have been mainly developed for file sharing or cycle sharing applications where the processes of searching and managing resources are not optimized. Locality algorithms have gained a lot of attention due to their potential to provide an optimized path to groups with similar interests for routing messages in order to get better network performance. This paper develops a fully functional decentralized communication architecture with a new P2P locality algorithm and a specific protocol for monitoring and control of microgrids. Experimental results show that the proposed locality algorithm reduces the number of lookup messages and the lookup delay time. Moreover, the proposed communication architecture heavily depends of the lookup used algorithm as well as the placement of the communication layers within the architecture. Experimental results will show that the proposed techniques meet the network requirements of smart microgrids even with a large number of nodes on stream.This work is supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant ENE2015-64087-C2-2R.

187722098,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence methodologies, as the core of discrete control and decision support systems, have been extensively applied
in the industrial production sector. The resulting tools produce excellent results in certain cases; however, the NP-hard nature of
many discrete control or decision making problems in the manufacturing area may require unaffordable computational resources,
constrained by the limited available time required to obtain a solution. With the purpose of improving the efficiency of a control
methodology for discrete systems, based on a simulation-based optimization and the Petri net (PN) model of the real discrete
event dynamic system (DEDS), this paper presents a strategy, where a transformation applied to the model allows removing the
redundant information to obtain a smaller model containing the same useful information. As a result, faster discrete optimizations
can be implemented.This methodology is based on the use of a formalism belonging to the paradigmof thePNfor describingDEDS,
the disjunctive colored PN. Furthermore, the metaheuristic of genetic algorithms is applied to the search of the best solutions in
the solution space. As an illustration of the methodology proposal, its performance is compared with the classic approach on a case

While this aspect is important, we recognize that the teaching methods in a majority of the STEM courses today are broken; there is a major discrepancy between the skills and mindsets in technical classes and the ones that are useful to solve actual problems in 'the real world'. Therefore, we suggest a new teaching framework called Data-X where entrepreneurial teaching methods developed in the Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship are applied to advanced technical topics. Through inductive learning and by practicing story creation, stakeholder generation, adaptation, ideation, innovation processes, and by having a diverse mix of students being coached by a network of expert advisors, this highly applied teaching method empowers students to pursue and find solutions to open-ended projects and problems. The Data-X framework has been implemented and tested for three semesters in a UC Berkeley course called Applied Data Science for Venture Applications. In the class the students pick up, become comfortable, and utilize state-of-the-art tools in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. The results, feedback, and testimonials we have received upon offering the class have been overwhelmingly positive, and we propose that the ideas and concepts behind Data-X can help fix many problems in modern STEM education",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Applying Entrepreneurial Teaching Methods to Advanced Technical STEM Courses,10.1109/ICE.2018.8436264,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
185535082,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"Graphs are a natural choice to encode data in many real–world applications. In fact, a graph can describe a given pattern as a complex structure made up of parts (the nodes) and relationships between them (the edges). Despite their rich representational power, most of machine learning approaches cannot deal directly with inputs encoded by graphs. Indeed, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been devised as an extension of recursive models, able to process general graphs, possibly undirected and cyclic. In particular, GNNs can be trained to approximate all the “practically useful” functions on the graph space, based on the classical inductive learning approach, realized within the supervised framework. However, the information encoded in the edges can actually be used in a more refined way, to switch from inductive to transductive learning. In this paper, we present an inductive–transductive learning scheme based on GNNs. The proposed approach is evaluated both on artificial and real–world datasets showing promising results.

80311918,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"Big data from floating cars supply a frequent, ubiquitous sampling of traffic conditions on the road network and provide great opportunities for enhanced short-term traffic predictions based on real-time information on the whole network. Two network-based machine learning models, a Bayesian network and a neural network, are formulated with a double star framework that reflects time and space correlation among traffic variables and because of its modular structure is suitable for an automatic implementation on large road networks. Among different mono-dimensional time-series models, a seasonal autoregressive moving average model (SARMA) is selected for comparison. The time-series model is also used in a hybrid modeling framework to provide the Bayesian network with an a priori estimation of the predicted speed, which is then corrected exploiting the information collected on other links. A large floating car data set on a sub-area of the road network of Rome is used for validation. To account for the variable accuracy of the speed estimated from floating car data, a new error indicator is introduced that relates accuracy of prediction to accuracy of measure. Validation results highlighted that the spatial architecture of the Bayesian network is advantageous in standard conditions, where a priori knowledge is more significant, while mono-dimensional time series revealed to be more valuable in the few cases of non-recurrent congestion conditions observed in the data set. The results obtained suggested introducing a supervisor framework that selects the most suitable prediction depending on the detected traffic regimes",'Elsevier BV',Short-term speed predictions exploiting big data on large urban road networks,10.1016/j.trc.2016.10.019,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Da allora, si é manifestata una crescente attenzione ai giovani nelle agende politiche nazionali e molti discorsi sono emersi rispetto alla loro integrazione sociale. Sulla base di un'analisi comparativa delle politiche sui giovani e sulla partecipazione giovanile condotta in otto paesi europei (PARTISPACE Project, Horizon 2020), l'obiettivo di questo articolo é quello di iniziare una riflessione pedagogica sulla partecipazione giovanile e le modalità con cui promuoverla, sia in termini di impegno giovanile rivolto alla costruzione dell'identita, all'auto-realizzazione sie in termini di sviluppo comunitario. Dopo aver introdotto la rappresentazione dei giovani proposta nelle politiche nazionali e nei discorsi, quali questioni giovanili risultano prioritare e le misure suggerite per promuovere il loro impegno, proponiamo alcune riflession sulle connessioni esistenti tra pedagogia e politiche e sulle modalità con cui l'educazione può promuovere tra i giovani un'attitudine realmente partecipativa, soprattutto per quel che riguarda i giovni in situazione di svantaggio socio-culturale.The European Commission’s White Paper on Youth in 2001 invites the Member States to ensure an effective planning and implementation of national youth policies.

After presenting what images of youth are proposed in the national policies and discourses, which youth issues are prioritized and measures suggested to promote youth participation, we propose some reflections about the connection of pedagogy and policy and the way in which education could foster a real youth participatory attitude, especially for what concerns ‘disadvantaged’ young people .mixedCuconato, MorenaCuconato, Moren",,Youth participation in Europe: a pedagogical reflection at the crossroads between discourses and policies,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

78071095,2015-06-01T00:00:00,"We present a wearable system that uses ambient electromagnetic interference (EMI) as a signature to identify electronic devices and support proxemic interaction. We designed a low cost tool, called EMI Spy, and a software environment for rapid deployment and evaluation of ambient EMI-based interactive infrastructure. EMI Spy captures electromagnetic interference and delivers the signal to a user's mobile device or PC through either the device's wired audio input or wirelessly using Bluetooth. The wireless version can be worn on the wrist, communicating with the user;s mobile device in their pocket. Users are able to train the system in less than 1 second to uniquely identify displays in a 2-m radius around them, as well as to detect pointing at a distance and touching gestures on the displays in real-time. The combination of a low cost EMI logger and an open source machine learning tool kit allows developers to quickly prototype proxemic, touch-to-connect, and gestural interaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of mobile, EMI-based device and gesture recognition with preliminary user studies in 3 scenarios, achieving 96% classification accuracy at close range for 6 digital signage displays distributed throughout a building, and 90% accuracy in classifying pointing gestures at neighboring desktop LCD displays. We were able to distinguish 1- and 2-finger touching with perfect accuracy and show indications of a way to determine power consumption of a device via touch. Our system is particularly well-suited to temporary use in a public space, where the sensors could be distributed to support a popup interactive environment anywhere with electronic devices.

147051667,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"Background: Helicobacter suis is a very fastidious microorganism associated with gastritis, gastric ulcers, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in humans. In vitro isolation of this agent from human patients has so far been unsuccessful. 
Materials and methods: A probe-based real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid detection of H.suis in gastric biopsies was developed. Secondly, a mouse-passage-based protocol was optimized for isolation of low numbers of viable H.suis bacteria. Mice were inoculated with different numbers of viable H.suis (10(2)-10(8)) and kept for 4weeks to allow multiplication of this pathogen. 
Results: The probe-based real-time PCR (RT-PCR) exhibited a high degree of diagnostic specificity and analytical sensitivity, high linear correlations (r(2) between 0.995 and 0.999), and high amplification efficiencies (>90%) for H.suis. No cross-reactivity was detected with human, porcine, non-human primate, and murine DNA nor with DNA from other bacteria including Helicobacter spp. and Campylobacter spp. H.suis was successfully re-isolated from the stomach of mice inoculated with at least 10(4) viable H.suis, using a biphasic medium (pH 5), consisting of Brucella agar with Brucella broth on top, both supplemented with vitox supplement, Campylobacter-selective supplement, amphotericin (5g/mL), HCl (0.05%), fetal bovine serum (20%), and linezolid (5g/mL). Linezolid was necessary to inhibit proliferation of contaminants, including lactobacilli.

275646428,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Traditional interaction mechanisms in distributed digital spaces often fail to consider the intrinsic properties of action, perception, and communication among workgroups, which may affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize information. By developing suitable spatial geometries and natural interaction mechanisms, distributed spaces can become blended where the physical and virtual boundaries of local and remote spaces merge together to provide the illusion of a single unified space. In this paper, we discuss the importance of blended interaction in distributed spaces and the particular challenges faced when designing accessible technology. We illustrate this discussion through a new tangible interaction mechanism for collaborative spaces based on tabletop system technology implemented with optical frames. Our tangible elements facilitate the exchange of digital information in distributed collaborative settings by providing a physical manifestation of common digital operations. The tangibles are designed as passive elements that do not require the use of any additional hardware or external power while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund, through the ANNOTA Project (Ref.

is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.

The aim is to create an interface between the surgeon and a surgical robotic assistant for two arms of minimally invasive surgery procedures. The proposed interface receives information about the positioning of surgical tools of the surgeon using 3D sensors and the recognition system facilitates the current maneuver is completed. Therefore, the recognition system maneuvers that supports this interface requires a library of models of maneuvers to work. The models chosen to represent the surgical maneuvers are Hidden Markov Models. To validate the proposed methodology, we have developed a series of in-vitro experiments.[ES] Este trabajo propone una metodología para el reconocimiento de maniobras quirúrgicas en intervenciones de cirugía laparoscópica.

217779102,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"OBJECTIVE: 

Several trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy of maternal hydration (MH) in increasing amniotic-fluid-volume (AFV) in pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios or normohydramnos have been conducted. Unfortunately, no evidences support this intervention in routine-clinical-practice. The aim of this systematic-literature-review and meta-analysis was to collect all data regarding proposed strategies and their efficacy in relation to each clinical condition for which MH-therapy was performed with the aim of increasing amniotic-fluid (AF) and improving perinatal outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 

A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic-database MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane-Library in the time interval between 1991 and 2014. Following the identification of eligible trials, we estimated the methodological quality of each study (using QADAS-2) and clustered patients according to the following outcome measures: route of administration (oral versus intravenous versus combined), total daily dose of fluids administered (2000), duration of hydration therapy: (1 day, >1 day but 1 week), type of fluid administered (isotonic versus hypotonic versus combination).

RESULTS: 

In isolated-oligohydramnios (IO), maternal oral hydration is more effective than intravenous hydration and hypotonic solutions superior to isotonic solutions. The improvement in AFV appears to be time-dependent rather than daily-dose dependent. Regarding normohydramnios pregnancies, all strategies seem equivalent though the administration of hypotonic-fluid appears to have a slightly greater effect than isotonic-fluid. Regarding perinatal outcomes, data is fragmentary and heterogeneous and does not allow us to define the real clinical utility of MH.

CONCLUSIONS: 

Available data suggests that MH may be a safe, well-tolerated and useful strategy to improve AFV especially in cases of IO. In view of the numerous obstetric situations in which a reduced AFV may pose a threat, particularly to the fetus, the possibility of increasing AFV with a simple and inexpensive practice like MH-therapy may have potential clinical applications. Considering the various strategies of maternal hydration implemented in the treatment of IO, better results were observed when treatment was based on a combination of intravenous (for a period of 1 day) and oral (for a period of at least 14 days) hypotonic fluids (≥2000ml)",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',An Update on Maternal Hydration Strategies for Amniotic Fluid Improvement in Isolated Oligohydramnios and Normohydramnios: Evidence from a Systematic Review of Literature and Meta-Analysis,10.1371/journal.pone.0144334,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
160335033,2012-09-04T00:00:00Z,"Advanced autonomous robotics space missions rely heavily on the flawless interaction of complex hardware, multiple sensors, and a mission-critical software system.  This software system consists of an operating system, device drivers, controllers, and executives; recently highly complex AI-based autonomy software have also been introduced. Prior to launch, this software has to undergo rigorous verification and validation (V&V).  Nevertheless, dormant software bugs, failing sensors, unexpected hardware-software interactions, and unanticipated environmental conditions—likely on a space exploration mission—can cause major software faults that can endanger the entire mission.

Our Integrated Software Health Management (ISWHM) system continuously monitors the hardware sensors and the software in real-time. The ISWHM uses Bayesian networks, compiled to arithmetic circuits, to model software and hardware interactions. Advanced reasoning algorithms using arithmetic circuits not only enable the ISWHM to handle large, hierarchical models that are necessary in the realm of complex autonomous systems, but also enable efficient execution on small embedded processors. The latter capability is of extreme importance for small (mobile) autonomous units with limited computational power and low telemetry bandwidth.  In this paper, we discuss the requirements of ISWHM.  As our initial demonstration platform, we use a primitive Lego rover. A Lego 
Mindstorms microcontroller is used to implement a highly simplified autonomous rover driving system, running on the OSEK real-time operating system. We demonstrate that our ISWHM, running on this small embedded microcontroller, can perform fault detection as well as on-board reasoning for advanced diagnosis and root-cause detection in real time",,Software and System Health Management for Autonomous Robotics Missions,10.1184/r1/6710654.v1,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

54611646,2015,"Obiettivi: l’integrazione tra servizi sanitari e servizi socio-assistenziali è uno dei temi più rilevanti per l’amministrazione comunale di Cagliari che sta realizzando alcuni interventi di recupero funzionale di immobili dismessi in quartieri con particolari problematiche socio-economiche per creare Strutture Sanitarie Integrate denominate “Centri di salute”, rivolte in particolare modo agli anziani, ma capaci di avere ricadute sull’intera struttura sociale di riferimento.

Metodi: gli strumenti utilizzati sono quelli della pianificazione strategica e degli investimenti territoriali integrati, secondo una logica di intervento sulla struttura fisica della città coerente con la struttura demografica dei residenti e quindi capace di rispondere ai bisogni reali degli abitanti. I quartieri scelti per la sperimentazione sono “zone di margine” caratterizzati da una condizione di segregazione sociale e spaziale. Il modello di gestione è quello della medicina di iniziativa con intervento proattivo basato sulla partecipazione e coinvolgimento delle persone.

Risultati: i primi risultati mettono in evidenza che l’intervento messo in atto si presta particolarmente al coinvolgimento della popolazione anziana emarginata, che per presenza di barriere sociali, economiche, culturali ed ambientali, sottoutilizza o non si rivolge ai servizi di cura. Inoltre, alle azioni specifiche su target predefinito (ultra 70enni) vengono affiancate attività di promozione sociale del valore della salute e della cultura della responsabilità all’auto-cura individuale e collettiva.Objectives: the integration of health and social services is one of the most important issues for the municipal amministration of Cagliari which is building, restoration of functional abandoned buildings in neighborhoods with particular socio-economic problems to create Integrated Medical Information referred to as “health centers”, aimed particularly so for the elderly, but capable of having repercussions on the entire social structure of reference.

Methods: the instruments used are the strategic planning and investment territorial integrated, according to a logic of intervention on the physical structure of the city in line with the demographic structure of the residents and therefore able to respond to the real needs of the inhabitants.

IODA directly links a whole image to a whole label map, assigning a label to each pixel using a single neural network forward step. Instead of designing a handcrafted a priori model on labels (such as an atlas in the medical domain), we propose to automatically learn the dependencies between labels. The originality of IODA is to transpose DNN input pre-training trick to the output space, in order to learn a high level representation of labels. It allows a fast image labeling inside a fully neural network framework, without the need of any preprocessing such as feature designing or output coding. In this article, IODA is applied on both a toy texture problem and a real-world medical image dataset, showing promising results.

53897709,2012,"Standard sociali e codici etici sono  considerati strumenti di autogoverno volontario da parte delle imprese e vengono promossi per incentivare lo sviluppo di azioni socialmente responsabili.  

In letteratura ci si interroga se la loro adozione possa essere considerata un’attestazione dell’impegno sociale dell’impresa o se gli standard si prestino ad adozioni “simboliche”, di pura facciata, non corrispondenti ad azioni effettivamente responsabili o, ancor peggio, dirette a nascondere comportamenti illeciti. Elementi di questo dibattito si ritrovano anche nella recente letteratura su piccole e medie imprese (PMI) e responsabilità sociale. Da un lato, si collocano coloro che spingono le piccole e medie imprese ad adottare pratiche formalizzate di responsabilità sociale ai fini di sfruttarne i vantaggi sul piano del business; dall’altro, c’è chi vede nella formalizzazione dei comportamenti sociali della piccola impresa una pratica contraddittoria rispetto all’informalità che caratterizza la piccola dimensione e ne sottolinea gli effetti controproducenti sulla piano della gestione interna (aumento di costi, difficoltà, rigidità strutturali). 

Questo contributo presenta i risultati di un indagine condotta nell’universo delle PMI italiane che hanno ottenuto la certificazione SA8000 al 30 giugno 2011 (tasso di risposta 29,6%). L’obiettivo è di approfondire motivazioni, comportamenti e valutazioni espresse dalle imprese che hanno intrapreso il percorso di certificazione. I risultati dell’indagine si propongono di fornire un contributo al dibattito in corso, a partire dalle valutazioni di coloro che hanno utilizzato nel concreto lo strumento di certificazione sociale.Standards and codes of ethics, including the Social Accountability 8000 International Standard (SA8000), are considered as mechanisms of self-regulation and they are promoted to encourage the development of socially responsible practices.

Scholars debate whether their adoption actually certifies the social responsible behaviors of firms or may be akin to window dressing: certification does not correspond to real responsible actions or, even, may conceal misconducts. 

Elements of this debate can be found in the recent literature on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). 

Some authors push SMEs to adopt formalized practices of CSR in order to exploit their benefits in term of business. On the other side, other authors consider the formalization of SMEs social behaviors in contradiction with the informal nature and entrepreneurial character of SMEs and emphasize its counterproductive effects on the internal management (increase in costs, difficulties, structural rigidities).

The paper presents the results of a study on Italian PMI that were SA8000 certified at 30 June 2011 (response rate of 29,6%). The results of the study aim to provide a contribution to the current debate, investigating motivations, behaviors and assessments provided by the SMEs that have actually implemented social certification tools",,Pratiche di responsabilità sociale nelle PMI certificate: Un’indagine sulla SA8000 in Italia,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The dynamics of the GCF is based on the estimation of the final state related to each alternative via a net of concepts and some evolution functions that define how the initial state will evolve given a certain alternative. The GCF scores the alternatives computing their expected utility and so, it requires a probability value associated to each possible final state. The estimated values of the criteria that characterize a state are bounded using fuzzy sets, which provide an easy method for assigning probability values. The GCF considers that it could be necessary to carry out simultaneously more than one alternative to mitigate a fire emergency.[ES] Este trabajo propone un Sistema Computacional de Ayuda a la Decisión, el Gestor de Crisis de Fuego (GCF), diseñado para ayudar a una persona a tomar decisiones en tiempo real en situaciones de emergencia, concretamente, en caso de incendio en un edificio.

34996307,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"Efficient and reliable simulation tools are essential for progress in brain research. Since the early days of neuronal computing (Farley & Clark, 1954), a wide range of simulators have been developed, each specialized on one or few spatial and temporal scales (Brette et al., 2007). But the reliable and reproducible simulation of such complex systems as the brain is a very demanding challenge. Thus, the Computational Neuroscience community concentrated on a few reliable and widely used simulation tools in recent years. Neuronal network simulation is thus coming of age: Just as our colleagues in electrophysiology, we begin to base our work increasingly on the use of standard tools, with modifications and adaptations for our particular research, instead of building home-brew solutions from scratch. This concentration was not least the result of a series of large-scale EU funded projects, such as FACETS, BrainScaleS and the recently announced Human Brain Project.From its humble beginnings as a PhD-student project 20 years ago, the Neural Simulation Tool NEST (Gewaltig & Diesmann, 2007) saw its first incarnation as the SYNOD simulator in 1995 (Diesmann et al., 1995), leading to exciting results on synfire chains early on (Diesmann et al., 1999). By tightly coupling software development with computational neuroscience research (Kunkel et al., 2010), simulator technology evolved steadily, facilitating new scientific insight at (nearly) every step. Some key examples were parallelization (Morrison et al., 2005; Plesser et al., 2007), exact integration of model equations (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999), precise spike times in a time-driven simulator (Morrison et al., 2007; Hanuschkin et al., 2010), spike- time-dependent (Morrison et al., 2007) and neuro-modulated plasticity (Potjans et al., 2010), and a Topology module for spatially structured networks (Plesser & Enger, 2013). Streamlined data-structures (Kunkel et al., 2011) allow NEST to efficiently exploit the capabilities of some of the largest computers on Earth for simula- tions on the brain scale (Helias et al., 2012). Systematic quality assurance through testsuites (Eppler et al., 2009) and continuous integration technology (Zaytsev & Morrison, 2013) ensure simulator reliability (within limits). With a user-friendly Python-based interface (Eppler et al., 2008; Gewaltig et al., 2012), integration with PyNN (Davison et al., 2008) for simulator-independent scripting and MUSIC support (Djurfeldt et al., 2010) for integrated multi-scale simulation, NEST is a powerful simulation tool for brain-scale simulations today.NEST has been publicly available since 2004 and has been taught at summer schools and graduate courses since, training a generation of computational scientists. This has lead to a steady increase in computational neuroscience publications based on NEST simulations in recent years (see http://www.nest-initiative.org for a list), indicating that NEST is indeed establishing itself as a widely used tool for the simulation of large networks of (comparatively) simple model neurons.As of the NEST 2.0 release in 2012, NEST is available under the GNU Public License to ensure wide dissemination. The further development of NEST is chaperoned by the NEST Initiative, a non-for-profit organization incorporated in Ecublens, Switzerland, which is open for interested scientists. We are currently preparing to move NEST source code to a distributed version control system, allowing all NEST users ”real time” access to bug fixes and improvements, and to facilitate contributions by the NEST Community.In our demonstration, we will illustrate the capabilities and versatility of NEST. We will in particular focus on three complementary approaches to simulating large-scale cortical networks: A data-driven approach based on detailed connectivity information (based on data from the Blue Brain Project), constructive network generation, based on connectivity patterns (Potjans & Diesmann, 2012), and simulation of advanced 3D topological networks.AcknowledgementsWe present this work on behalf of the NEST Initiative.

We wish to create a system that will gather and process all data related to a particular e-learning course. To make monitoring easier, we will provide reliable statistics, behaviour groups and predicted results as a basis for an intelligent virtual tutor using the mentioned methods. This system will be described in this article. In this step of the project, we are clustering students by mining Moodle log data. A first objective is to define relevant clustering features. We will describe and evaluate our proposal. A second objective is to determine if our students show different learning behaviours. We will experiment whether there is an overall ideal number of clusters and whether the clusters show mostly qualitative or quantitative differences. Experiments in clustering were carried out using real data obtained from various courses dispensed by a partner institute using a Moodle platform.

Howe- ver the need for a satisfactory similarity between model and real object collides with the need to preserve the original accuracy of the measure- ment of the former than the latter. The analysis of the Compañía de Jesús facade has tried to cope this duality using the power of reverse modeling and texturing, the latter is really important due to the function of the photographic images into accurate description of materials and colours, as well as in the creation of 3D models using UV mapping tools, which are a very advanced field of the computer graphic software.Nell’ ambito delle ricerche scientifiche sui beni culturali le tecniche di modellazione 3D applicate ai dati provenienti da campagne di rilevamento scanner laser stanno assumendo sempre più importanza.

33499577,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"There is an increasing need in biology and clinical medicine to robustly and reliably measure tens-to-hundreds of peptides and proteins in clinical and biological samples with high sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and repeatability. Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification. Digestion recovery of peptides was assessed and quantitative accuracy improved using heavy isotope labeled versions of the proteins as internal standards. Using the highly multiplexed assay, participating laboratories were able to precisely and reproducibly determine the levels of a series of analytes in blinded samples used to simulate an inter-laboratory clinical study of patient samples.

244639007,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Many fields of modern science require huge amounts of computation, and workflows are a very popular tool in e-Science since they allow to organize many small, simple tasks to solve big problems. They are used in astronomy, bioinformatics, machine learning, social network analysis, physics, and many other branches of science. Workflows are notoriously difficult to schedule, and the vast majority of research on workflow scheduling is concerned with scheduling single workflows with known runtimes. The goal of this PhD research is to bring more realism to the problem of workflow scheduling in actual systems. First, in real systems, multiple workflows may be contending for the available resources. Second, task runtime estimates are not always known, and task runtime estimates may be wrong. Third, workflows are usually not the only type of jobs submitted to a system, there may for instance also be parallel applications and bags-of-tasks. Accordingly, the purpose of this PhD research is to create and analyze policies for online scheduling of workloads of workflows with and without known task runtimes that also contain jobs of other types. We are in the process of simulating policies, and we will validate our results by means of an implementation and real-world experiments with the KOALA-W workflow processing system.Distributed System",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Towards a Realistic Scheduler for Mixed Workloads with Workflows,10.1109/CCGrid.2015.74,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

275598738,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The bale collecting problem (BCP) appears after harvest operations in grain and other crops. Its solution defines the sequence of collecting bales which lie scattered over the field. Current technology on navigation-aid systems or auto-steering for agricultural vehicles and machines, is able to provide accurate data to make a reliable bale collecting planning. This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approach to address the BCP pursuing resource optimization such as minimizing non-productive time, fuel consumption, or distance travelled. The algorithmic route generation provides the basis for a navigation tool dedicated to loaders and bale wagons. The approach is experimentally tested on a set of instances similar to those found in real situations. In particular, comparative results show an average improving of a 16% from those obtained by previous heuristics.This work was supported in part by the Spanish Government (research project AGL2010-15334).Gracia Calandin, CP.; Diezma Iglesias, B.; Barreiro Elorza, P.

29405426,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Autonomy is a prime issue on robotics field and it is closely related to decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance.

They represent a pattern, a paradigm, or an archetype to be wrapped around some kind of reality. Standards related to the Internet and its applications are explicit sets of requirements to be satisfied. Applying and implementing such standards reveals their capabilities to definitively satisfy their goals, beyond the authoritative principles they implicitly carry on. This paper explores questions and perspectives about the implementation of two accessibility standards in an e-learning platform, achieving inclusion both of the standards and their goals to provide accessibility. Their actual implementation in the LCMS ATutor reinforces considerations about inconsistencies and points out some aspects which may otherwise not be glaring.

19208033,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"We introduce AutoMoDe: a novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms. The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.SCOPUS: ar.jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',AutoMoDe: A novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms,10.1007/s11721-014-0092-4,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
74495544,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Objective: This study aims to develop an advanced portable remote monitoring system to supervise high intensity treadmill exercises. Materials and methods: The supervisory level of the developed hierarchical system is implemented on a portable monitoring device (iPhone/iPad) as a client application, while the real-time control of treadmill exercises is accomplished by using an on-line adaptive neural network control scheme in a local computer system. During training or rehabilitation exercises, the intensity (measured by heart rate) is regulated by simultaneously manipulating both treadmill speed and gradient. In order to achieve adaptive tracking performance, a neural network controller has been designed and implemented. Results: Six real-time experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the developed monitoring system. Experimental results obtained in real-time with heart-rate set-point varying from 145bpm to 180bmp, demonstrate that the proposed system can quickly and accurately regulate exercise intensity of treadmill running exercises with desired performance (no overshoot, settling time Ts≤100s). Subjects aged from 29 to 38 years old participated in different set-point experiments to confirm the system's adaptability to inter- and intra-model uncertainty. The desired system performance under external disturbances has also been confirmed in a final real-time experiment demonstrating a user carrying the 10kg bag then removing it during the exercise. Conclusion: In contrast with conventional control approaches, the proposed adaptive controller achieves better heart rate tracking performance under inter- and intra-model uncertainty and external disturbances. The developed system can automatically adapt to various individual exercisers and a range of exercise intensity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V",'Elsevier BV',Advanced portable remote monitoring system for the regulation of treadmill running exercises,10.1016/j.artmed.2014.05.002,http://hdl.handle.net/10453/33312,"[{'title': 'Artificial Intelligence in Medicine', 'identifiers': ['0933-3657', 'issn:0933-3657']}]",core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Agents provide suitable flexibility to give support to implied heterogeneity in cyber-physical systems. Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Control (QoC) parameters are commonly utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the communications and the control loop. Agents can use the quality measures to take a wide range of decisions, like suitable placement on the control node or to change the workload to save energy. This article describes the architecture of a multi agent system that provides support to QoS and QoC parameters to optimize de system.

155494719,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of multi-agent system theory and techniques, offer great promises in the development of decision support systems. This paper designs an agent-based regional agricultural economy decision support system (RAEDSS) to deal with complex decision problems. It introduces the architecture of the system, including interface agents, management agents, functional agents, model agents, information agents and knowledge agents and their interactions. Since dynamic analysis, evaluation, forecast, optimization and decision of regional agricultural economy are the central task of RAEDSS, this paper gives a detailed discussion on the decision processes and internal mechanisms in the system. Meanwhile, agent-based modeling is introduced to simulate and evaluate policy impact on rural development in different scenarios as an important part in RAEDSS. The simulation result shows that this agent-based agricultural development model is able to perform regeneration and is able to produce likely-to-occur projections of reality. The related issue such as building an agent based on the theory of classifier systems is also surveyed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

275594362,2013-06-01T00:00:00,"Thanks to the built in intelligence (deployment of new intelligent devices and sensors in places where historically they were not present), the Smart Grid and Microgrid paradigms are able to take advantage from aggregated load forecasting, which opens the door for the implementation of new algorithms to seize this information for optimization and advanced planning. Therefore, accuracy in load forecasts will potentially have a big impact on key operation factors for the future Smart Grid/Microgrid-based energy network like user satisfaction and resource saving, and new methods to achieve an efficient prediction in future energy landscapes (very different from the centralized, big area networks studied so far). This paper proposes different improved models to forecast next day's aggregated load using artificial neural networks, taking into account the variables that are most relevant. In particular, seven models based on the multilayer perceptron will be proposed, progressively adding input variables after analyzing the influence of climate factors on aggregated load.

52754184,2005-10-27T00:00:00,"International audienceDuring August 2004 an Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (TSI ATOFMS Model 3800-100) and an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) were deployed at Mace Head during the NAMBLEX campaign. Single particle data (size, positive and negative mass spectra) from the ATOFMS were imported into ART 2a, a neural network algorithm, which assigns individual particles to clusters on the basis of their mass spectral similarities. Results are very consistent with previous time consuming manual classifications (Dall'Osto et al., 2004). Three broad classes were found: sea-salt, dust and carbon-containing particles, with a number of sub-classes within each. The Aerodyne (AMS) instrument was also used during NAMBLEX, providing online, real time measurements of the mass of non-refractory components of aerosol particles as function of their size.  The ATOFMS detected a type of particle not identified in our earlier analysis, with a strong signal at m/z 24, likely due to magnesium. This type of particle was detected during the same periods as pure unreacted sea salt particles and is thought to be biogenic, originating from the sea surface. AMS data are consistent with this interpretation, showing an additional organic peak in the corresponding size range at times when the Mg-rich particles are detected. The work shows the ATOFMS and AMS to be largely complementary, and to provide a powerful instrumental combination in studies of atmospheric chemistry",European Geosciences Union,Studies of aerosol at a coastal site using two aerosol mass spectrometry instruments and identification of biogenic particle types,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
250235516,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"WOS: 000269711300010It is crucial to improve the photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency and to develop the reliability of PV generation control systems. There are two ways to increase the efficiency of PV power generation system. The first is to develop materials offering high conversion efficiency at low cost. The second is to operate PV systems optimally. However, the PV system can be optimally operated only at a specific output voltage and its output power fluctuates under intermittent weather conditions. Moreover, it is very difficult to test the performance of a maximum-power point tracking (MPPT) controller under the same weather condition during the development process and also the field testing is costly and time consuming. This paper presents a novel real-time simulation technique of PV generation system by using dSPACE real-time interface system. The proposed system includes Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic controller scheme using polar information. This type of fuzzy logic rules is implemented for the first time to operate the PV module at optimum operating point. ANN is utilized to determine the optimum operating voltage for monocrystalline silicon, thin-film cadmium telluride and triple junction amorphous silicon solar cells. The verification of availability and stability of the proposed system through the real-time simulator shows that the proposed system can respond accurately for different scenarios and different solar cell technologies.

60415687,2006-01-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, a neural-network-based method for the
analysis of practical multilayered shielded microwave circuits is
presented. Using this idea, a radial basis function neural network
(RBFNN) is trained to approximate the space-domain multilayered
media boxed Green’s functions used in the integral-equation
(IE) method. Once the RBFNN has been trained, the outputs of the
neural network (NN) replace the exact Green’s functions, during
the numerical solution of the IE. The computation of the RBFNN
output values is very fast in comparison with the numerical
methods used to calculate the exact Green’s functions. This paper
describes two novel strategies for efficiently training the RBFNN.
In the first strategy, the input space of the RBFNN is divided into
several spatial and frequency regions. The spatial subdivision is
extended for the first time to both observation and source regions.
In addition, the subdivision of the observation points regions is
applied in a novel manner to the whole cross section of the metallic
box. The second strategy combines the above region subdivision
with an adaptive selection of the neurons variances in each region.

Previously, we demonstrated that LC-MRM-MS with isotope dilution has suitable performance for quantitative measurements of small numbers of relatively abundant proteins in human plasma, and that the resulting assays can be transferred across laboratories while maintaining high reproducibility and quantitative precision. Here we significantly extend that earlier work, demonstrating that 11 laboratories using 14 LC-MS systems can develop, determine analytical figures of merit, and apply highly multiplexed MRM-MS assays targeting 125 peptides derived from 27 cancer-relevant proteins and 7 control proteins to precisely and reproducibly measure the analytes in human plasma. To ensure consistent generation of high quality data we incorporated a system suitability protocol (SSP) into our experimental design. The SSP enabled real-time monitoring of LC-MRM-MS performance during assay development and implementation, facilitating early detection and correction of chromatographic and instrumental problems. Low to sub-nanogram/mL sensitivity for proteins in plasma was achieved by one-step immunoaffinity depletion of 14 abundant plasma proteins prior to analysis. Median intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility was <20%, sufficient for most biological studies and candidate protein biomarker verification. Digestion recovery of peptides was assessed and quantitative accuracy improved using heavy isotope labeled versions of the proteins as internal standards. Using the highly multiplexed assay, participating laboratories were able to precisely and reproducibly determine the levels of a series of analytes in blinded samples used to simulate an inter-laboratory clinical study of patient samples.

The maximum likelihood (ML) technique is a powerful tool to solve this problem. But a direct approach that uses the ML estimator to solve the localization problem is exhaustive search in the solution space, and it is very computationally expensive, and prohibits real-time processing. On the basis of ML function, a closed-form approximate solution to the ML equations can be obtained, which can allow real-time implementation as well as global convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves better performance than the two-step weighted least squares (WLS) approach, which makes it possible to attain the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) at a sufficiently high noise level before the threshold effect occurs",Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

53520855,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"In recent years there has been a growing interest in Bayesian inference in numerous scientific disciplines. Structural equation models (SEM) are an important tool in the social and behavioural sciences to evaluate the structure of a model with latent and observed variables. However, the use of a Bayesian approach (BA) in this field is still underexplored. In this work, we illustrate the advantages of using the BA in a relevant SEM sub- model, i.e., confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Specifically, the goals are to (1) compare the traditional maximum likelihood approach (MLA) with the BA in terms of parameter estimation and fit indices; (2) show how the BA allows to estimate further models that may result unidentified via the classical approach, but may better reflect the underlying psychological theory; and (3) present BA-based techniques for model diagnostic in terms of the distribution of estimated parameters as well as single case influence. To address the first aim, a simulation study was performed. Starting from a baseline two-correlated factor model, we manipulated sample size and effect size of a potential cross-loading for a specific item. For each condition, we estimated 2 bayesian CFAs (one including and one excluding the cross- loading) and 2 ML CFAs. Next, a bayesian CFA on a real case-study is presented. The magnitude of cross-loadings and residual correlations were simultaneously evaluated according to different theoretical models through different parameter prior specifications. The most plausible model was selected using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). Parameter posterior distributions and predictive posterior distribution of the observed data were used to examine model fit. All analyses were conducted using free software (i.e., R in combination with JAGS). Differences and similarities between the BA and MLA will be discussed. Overall, the formalization of model parameters in terms of prior probability distributions, instead of the less realistic parameters presence-or-absence formalization, provided a more flexible and informative evaluation of the latent structure of the observed data. To conclude, we will briefly review potential applications of the BA to the broader context of structural equation models",,A Bayesian approach to confirmatory factor analysis: Moving beyond dichotomous thinking,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
196689363,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Autonomy is a prime issue on robotics field and it is closely related to decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments.

299434479,2015,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

Materials and Methods: 50 lesions previously detected at mammography or conventional US were evaluated by means of CEUS and MRI. Contrast-enhanced examinations were performed with a dedicated equipment (Esatune, Esaote, Genoa, Italy), before and after injection of 4.8 ml of Sonovue (Bracco, Milan, Italy). MRI was conducted with a 1.5 T equipment (Siemens Vision Plus, Erlangen, Germany) with bilateral dedicated superficial coil, on T2w STIR and 3D Flash T1w before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes after the administration of contrast agent (Gd-DTPA, 1.5 ml/ Kg). Wash-in and wash out curves were assessed for both procedures. A specific sonographic quan-, tification software (Qontrast, Bracco, Milan, Italy), based off pixel by pixel signal intensity over time, was used to obtain contrast-enhanced sonographic perfusion maps for each lesion. Mc Nemar test was then calculated. Results: 24 invasive ductal carcinomas, 18 fibroadenomas, 4 fibro-cystic dysplasias, 1 mucin ous carcinoma, 1 invasive ducto-lobularcarcinoma, 1 intraductal florid papillomatosis and 1 phylloides tumour were diagnosed. Contrastenhanced sonographic patterns correlated well with those provided by MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US were: 69.2%, 66.7%, and 68%, respectively. According to the different contrast enhancement patterns and the resulting perfusion maps, all the malignant lesions and 9 out of 12 benign lesions were correctly diagnosed, thus resulting in 87.5% of specificity and 100% of sensitivity. Regarding the specificity, there is no difference between US and CEUS with McNemar (p=0.18). Regarding sensitivity, the difference between contrast-enhanced US and US is significant as calculated with McNemar test (p=0.013). The three lesions which were incorrectly classified as malignant were two hypervascularised fibroadenomas in young women and a phylloides tumour. Conclusion: CEUS seems to be a reliable method to differentiate breast lesions, since it provides typical enhancement patterns.

54423606,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"Vieni via con me. Culture partecipative, fruizione televisiva, social media e civic engagement



Obiettivi del contributo e teorie di riferimento



Obiettivo di questo paper è ragionare sul ruolo che i social media esercitano - in accordo con i contenuti mediali tradizionali - nella definizione del senso di appartenenza sociale e partecipazione culturale dei soggetti alla vita quotidiana.



In particolare, oggetto del nostro lavoro sono le pratiche partecipative messe in campo dagli utenti dei social media a ridosso di Vieni via con me, un programma televisivo andato in onda sulla Rai nel mese di novembre 2010, per 4 puntate. 

Il prodotto si è configurato come vero e proprio media event (Dayan e Katz, 1992), per diverse ragioni:

In primo luogo, ha dato vita ad una vastissima copertura mediale, sia attraverso mezzi tradizionali che social media, che si è sviluppata precedentemente e successivamente alla messa in onda, in relazione  alla valenza politica dei contenuti proposti (letti in chiave ideologico-oppositiva al Governo) e rispetto alla scelta dei conduttori e degli ospiti del programma (uno dei quali è il noto scrittore Roberto Saviano, autore di Gomorra, un libro denuncia sulla camorra, apertamente schierato in senso anti-Berlusconiano).

Un altro aspetto degno di nota è senza dubbio il risultato in termini di dati di ascolto registrati durante le 4 puntate: il sistema di rilevazione metrico Auditel (people meter) ha segnalato medie di share nel prime time pari al 25,48%, 30%, 21,21% 31,60% 29,17% , e un ascolto medio intorno ai 9 milioni; pur in una fase di costante contrazione degli ascolti della tv generalista (free e/o servizio pubblico), il programma  si è posizionato al 7 posto tra i più visti in Italia nel 2010 e ha riportato davanti agli schermi tv pubblici giovani, ormai orientati verso altre forme di consumo culturale. 

Infine, per la prima volta in maniera significativa in Italia, è emerso, a ridosso di un programma certamente non di intrattenimento o di fiction, un fenomeno consistente di fruizione on line e just in time del prodotto (Baym), attraverso social media che ne hanno rilanciato contenuti e commenti, coltivando un senso di appartenenza e di comunità e una ritualità performativa innovativa tra le audience.



Nell’ambito di una più ampia riflessione sul rapporto tra utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie, proiezioni identitarie e articolazione delle relazioni sociali (si vedano, tra gli altri, Boase e Wellman 2006, Buckingham 2008, Castells 2001, Castells et al., 2006, Wellman 2004), il presente lavoro fa riferimento, in modo specifico, all’ampio dibattito sviluppato intorno ai concetti di cultura convergente, culture partecipative, user generated content (si vedano in primo luogo Jenkins 2006 e Jenkins et al. 2009; Burgess e Green, 2009), recuperando parte della letteratura sul fandom e, in particolare, sulle produzioni dei fan (si vedano tra gli altri Jenkins 2006, Hills 2002). Faremo inoltre riferimento alla più recente letteratura sulle nuove pratiche di fruizione televisiva, che vedono una crescente integrazione tra la programmazione broadcast e forme di appropriazione dei contenuti da parte delle audience che prevedono un crescente uso dei social media – e di Twitter1 in particolare (Gripsrud, 2010; Kackman et al, 2011; Rappaport, 2011). Attraverso il commento e la rielaborazione in tempo reale dei contenuti broadcast, le audience connesse costituiscono specifiche comunità immaginate (Anderson, 1983) legate a specifici contenuti mediali. Il programma è stato recepito come un'occasione di riflessione politica, con forti connotazioni anti governative, al punto che la sua stessa fruizione è stata interpretata, da molti degli spettatori attivi sui social media, come un momento di civic engagement (sul tema della nuova sfera pubblica si vedano Castells 2008 e 2009; sul rapporto tra social media e civic engagement si veda Johnson et al, 2011).



Obiettivi di ricerca



1.Valutare l’impatto del prodotto a livello sociale e culturale, cercando di individuare le ragioni di un successo non solo televisivo (e fuori dai canoni televisivi) e rintracciando le connessioni tra l’engagement nei confronti del programma tv e l’eventuale civic engagement (Silverstone, 1999) dei soggetti verso la sfera politica e pubblica.

2.Individuare le ritualità del consumo del contenuto mediale e la costruzione grassroot dell’evento, indagando e descrivendo le connessioni esistenti tra il momento squisitamente televisivo e le pratiche discorsive e produttive delle audience, così come si sono concretizzate attraverso differenti piattaforme di comunicazione on line.

3.Cogliere i tratti e le pratiche di una participatory culture (Jenkins et al., 2009) e individuare i segni della costruzione di una comunità immaginata (Anderson, 1983) tra i pubblici dell’evento.

4.Leggere il ruolo dei social network sites in Italia come preparatori ad una nuova forma di partecipazione politica (in linea con quanto emerso recentemente in Nord Africa o a ridosso delle elezioni amministrative di maggio 2011) 



Metodologia utilizzata



Dal punto di vista della metodologia di ricerca, è stato scelto un approccio blended, etnografico e netnografico (Hine, 2000; Markham & Baym, 2009; Kozinets, 2010):



1.Interviste in profondità (30) ai pubblici del programma, selezionati sulla base dei dati di ascolto registrati dal people meter (Auditel) sulle motivazioni del successo del prodotto, sul vissuto sociale e culturale dell’intervistato, il contesto e le pratiche della sua fruizione televisiva, l’approccio al programma, la percezione e il giudizio del prodotto o di alcune sue parti, l’eventuale utilizzo di Internet e dei social media prima, durante o dopo la visione, la valenza politica del consumo culturale.

2.Analisi quanti-qualitativa dei Tweet registrati in rete in relazione al programma #Vieni via con me# (26.000), per cronologia (just in time o pre-post visione), tipologia di contenuti e aree semantiche di riferimento. 

3.Analisi quanti-qualitativa dei video caricati su Youtube in relazione al programma, in termini di cronologia (just in time o post visione), tipologia dei video (cut and paste, o new editing), visualizzazioni e commenti.



Principali risultati della ricerca



La ricerca ha prodotto interessanti esiti in termini di individuazione di:

nuove modalità ibride di fruizione dei contenuti video attraverso diverse piattaforme 

Costruzioni di comunità e rituali on line in relazione a contenuti mediali off line

Emergenza di pratiche proprie della cultura partecipativa

Connessione tra consumo mediale e civic engagementCome away with me. Participatory cultures, television viewing, social media and civic engagementObiettivi contribution and theories of riferimentoObiettivo of this paper is to reason about the role that social media exercise - in agreement with the contents of traditional media - in the definition of a sense of social and cultural participation of the subjects life quotidiana.In particular object of our work are participatory practices put in place by the users of social media in the shelter of Come away with me, a television program aired on Rai in November 2010 for 4 episodes. The product is configured as a real media event (Dayan and Katz, 1992), for several reasons: First, it has created a huge media coverage, both through traditional means and social media, which has been previously developed and after the broadcast, in relation to the political significance of the proposed contents (beds in key ideological and oppositional to the government) and with respect to the choice of conductors and guest of the program (one of which is the well-known writer Roberto Saviano, author of Gomorrah, a book report on the Camorra, openly deployed in an anti-Berlusconi). Another noteworthy aspect is undoubtedly the result in terms of audience figures recorded during the 4 episodes: the detection system metric Auditel (people meter) reported average audience share in prime time equal to 25.48%, 30%, 21,21% 31,60% 29,17%, and an average audience of around 9 million, while in a state of constant contraction of the plays of generalist TV (free and / or public service), the program was ranked seventh place among the most viewed in Italy in 2010 and brought in front of the tv screens young audiences, now oriented towards other forms of cultural consumption. Finally, for the first time significantly in Italy, it was found, next to a program certainly not entertainment or fiction, a phenomenon consisting of fruition online and just in time of the product (Baym), through social media that relaunched content and comments, cultivating a sense of belonging and community rituals and performative innovative audience.Nell between the 'context of a wider reflection on the relationship between use of new technologies, projections of identity and articulation of social relations (see, among others, Boase and Wellman 2006 Buckingham in 2008, Castells 2001, Castells et al., 2006 Wellman 2004), this paper refers, specifically, the broad debate developed around the concepts of convergence culture, participatory cultures , user generated content (see first Jenkins 2006 Jenkins et al., 200",,"Vieni via con me.

148683794,2015-06-03T00:00:00,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept.

Researches and developers are trying to make machines and software's more efficient and intelligent. This is where the Artificial Intelligence plays its role in developing efficient and optimal searching algorithm solutions. Genetic algorithm is one of most pervasive and advanced developed heuristic search technique in AI. Genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to find the most optimized solution for a given problem based on inheritance, mutation, selection and some other techniques. It was proved that genetic algorithms are the most powerful unbiased optimization techniques for sampling a large solution space. In this paper, we have used GA for the image optimization and Knapsack Problems, which are commonly found in a real world scenario. Furthermore, a research based on a tool that uses Genetic Algorithm, called the GA Playground is done to demonstrate the capability of solving the Knapsack Problem with the fitness function and a case study on how images can be reproduced using the optimal parameters.

295462858,2010-07-05,"Computer science studies possess a strong multidisciplinary vocation; most graduates do their professional work elsewhere of a computing environment, in collaboration with professionals from many different areas. However, the training offered in computer science studies lacks that multidisciplinary, focusing more on purely technical aspects. The campus, a place where studies of very different nature exist side by side, may constitute an excellent basis for conducting multidisciplinary training without underestimating higher education rigor. The aim of the universities is to train their students in the skills demanded by businesses and companies. According to experts, students need to develop more the skills called generic in which can be found the interpersonal skills. This paper presents a good example where computer studies and educational psychology find out a common ground and realistic working through laboratory practices. Specifically, the work enables to students of computer science education the development of diagnosis support systems, with artificial intelligence techniques, that could then be used for future educational psychologists. The applications developed by computer science students is the creation of a model for the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), sometimes also commonly called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The complexity of this diagnosis, not only by the exclusive characteristics of every person who suffer it but also by the large numbers of variables involved in it, requires a very strong and closed interdisciplinary participation. Moreover, for the enhancement of this software (and especially for the collection and creation of the database) it has been required the creation of a working framework which involves doctors and families, as well as those students of computer science and educational psychology already mentioned. The final purpose of this tool for the diagnosis is its applicability in primary schools to increase the early detection and diagnosis. Meanwhile, students of educational psychology incorporate their knowledge to adjust the computer application successfully, incorporating it the qualitative and quantitative information needed for verification. As a result of this synergy, a good interdisciplinary teamwork has emerged, closer to the real world than the university and which all would be enriched. In this sense, this work demonstrates that it is possible to intervene in a curricular perspective, in the university, to promote the development of interpersonal skills. It can be shown, in this way, a methodology for interdisciplinary practices design and a guide for monitoring and evaluation",IATED,Development of multidisciplinary practical lessons through research-action methodology in the faculties of computer science and educational psychology,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
83702939,2009-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper discusses a method for abnormal motion detection and its real-time implementation on a smart camera. Abnormal motion detection is a surveillance technique that only allows unfamiliar motion patterns to result in alarms. Our approach has two phases. First, normal motion is detected and the motion paths are trained, building up a model of normal behaviour. Feed-forward neural networks are here used for learning. Second, abnormal motion is detected by comparing the current observed motion to the stored model. A complete demonstration system is implemented to detect abnormal paths of persons moving in an indoor space. As platform we used a wireless smart camera system containing an SIMD (Single.

323090881,2015-10-15T00:00:00,"[ES] En este trabajo se presenta un nuevo esquema de control para un sistema fotovoltaico aislado (PV) utilizando un controlador de lógica borrosa (FLC). El sistema de control diseñado proporciona un buen seguimiento de la tensión de referencia óptima, a la cual se genera la máxima potencia. El sistema fotovoltaico está conectado a una carga a través de un convertidor CC/CC elevador (boost). El controlador FLC proporciona el ciclo de trabajo (D) apropiado al convertidor CC/CC para que el sistema PV genere la máxima potencia. También se propone un método de análisis de la estabilidad del sistema en lazo cerrado. Aunque el análisis de la estabilidad está basado en la metodología de Lyapunov, es un análisis semicualitativo, ya que no se dispone de un modelo del sistema en lazo cerrado para realizar un análisis analítico. Tanto los resultados de simulación como las pruebas experimentales sobre un sistema PV comercial muestran que el FLC proporciona un buen seguimiento del punto de máxima potencia (MPP). Finalmente, se ha evaluado el funcionamiento del FLC sobre un sistema PV real formado por unas placas fotovoltaicas comerciales Atersa modelo A55. Para realizar las pruebas experimentales se ha implementado la estrategia de control sobre un procesador digital de señal DS1104 de dSPACE. Los resultados experimentales obtenidos demuestran la validez del esquema de control FLC sobre un sistema fotovoltaico comercial.[EN] This paper presents a new control scheme for a standalone photovoltaic (PV) system based on a fuzzy-logic (FLC). The proposed control system provides good tracking for the optimal reference voltage, at which the maximum power generation is obtained. The photovoltaic system is connected to a load through a DC/DC boost converter. The FLC controller provides the appropriate duty cycle (D) to the DC/DC converter in order to get the maximum power from the PV system. A method for the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is also proposed. The stability analysis is based on the Lyapunov methods and is a semi-qualitative analysis because there is no closed loop system model available for the analytical analysis. Both simulation results and experimental tests on a real PV system show that the FLC provides good tracking for the maximum power point (MPP).Finally, the performance of the FLC on a real PV system consisting of a commercial solar panels Atersa model A55 is analyzed. To perform the experimental tests the proposed control strategy has been implemented on the dSPACE digital signal processor model DS1104. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed FLC control scheme over a commercial photovoltaic system.Este trabajo ha sido realizado parcialmente gracias al apoyo de la Universidad del País Vasco (GIU13/41 y UFI11/07) y al proyecto TEP-6124 financiado por la Junta de AndalucíaFarhat, M.; Barambones, Ó.; Ramos, JA.; Durán, E.; Andújar, JM.

43491761,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Passenger flow modeling and station dwelling time estimation are significant elements for railway mass transit planning, but system operators usually have limited information to model the passenger flow. In this paper, an artificial-intelligence technique known as fuzzy logic is applied for the estimation of the elements of the origin-destination matrix and the dwelling time of stations in a railway transport system. The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

The definitive Version of Record was published in {Source Publication}, http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2693787.2693794Looking for effective ways to understand how animals interact with computer-mediated systems, Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research should rely on the most natural and intrinsic behavior among the majority of living species: play. Animals are naturally motivated towards playing. Playful environments are, therefore, a promising scenario in which to start developing animal-centered ecosystems, and there are plenty of circumstances where playful environments could help to improve animals  well-being. However, developing a custom system for each possible context remains unfeasible, and more appealing solutions are required. If playful environments were equipped with intelligent capabilities, they could learn from the animals  behavior and automatically adapt themselves to the animals  needs and preferences by creating engaging playful activities for different purposes. Hence, this work will define intelligent playful environments for animals and explain how Ambient Intelligence (AmI) can contribute to create adaptable playful experiences for animals in order to improve their quality of life.This work was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under the National R&D&I Program within the project CreateWorlds (TIN2010-20488).

275603241,2010-01-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, we propose a secure spontaneous ad-hoc network, based on direct peer-to-peer interaction, to grant a quick, easy, and secure access to the users to surf the Web. The paper shows the description of our proposal, the procedure of the nodes involved in the system, the security algorithms implemented, and the designed messages. We have taken into account the security and its performance. Although some people have defined and described the main features of spontaneous ad-hoc networks, nobody has published any design and simulation until today. Spontaneous networking will enable a more natural form of wireless computing when people physically meet in the real world. We also validate the success of our proposal through several simulations and comparisons with a regular architecture, taking into account the optimization of the resources of the devices. Finally, we compare our proposal with other caching techniques published in the related literature. The proposal has been developed with the main objective of improving the communication and integration between different study centers of low-resource communities. That is, it lets communicate spontaneous networks, which are working collaboratively and which have been created on different physical places.Authors want to give thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions, useful comments, and proofreading of this paper.

327184530,,"Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces. The results show that our proposed approach effectively recovers human mobility trace from the incomplete and noisy data input, and discovers meaningful patterns of inferred traces from various objects",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Tensor Voting Techniques and Applications in Mobile Trace Inference,10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2512380.,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
389907284,2015-12-17T00:00:00,"Objective. This paper presents the selective particle swarm optimization and results of it applying to solve a problem of the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously for a real distribution system with 3 substations, 37 feeders, 274 buses, 284 branches and 11 normally open switches located in the eastern part of Mariupol city. Technique. Selective particle swarm optimization as a simple modification of the binary particle swarm optimization to search in a selected decision space was used for solving the aforesaid problem formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer combinatorial nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a plenty of test systems and real schemes with the different number of buses were used and selective particle swarm optimization was compared to another modern heuristic and artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony search algorithm, fuzzy-reasoning approach, etc.). MATLAB R2010a was applied as a computational tool to realize the proposed algorithm for modeling of the real large-scale distribution system. Before starting simulation, the long-term measurements (during one week) of the active and reactive power, power factor, voltage distortion and unbalance were made by Fluke 435 power quality analyzer on the four feeders with the highest active power losses and voltage drop. Results. Simulation results before and after optimization demonstrated an effectiveness of the selective particle swarm optimization in reducing the both active power and energy losses, improving the voltage quality and receiving the total annual saving. A comparative study of the three abovementioned techniques (capacitor placement, reconfiguration and reconductoring) to optimize a performance of the large-scale distribution system was executed. Scientific novelty. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for an optimization procedure of the real large-scale distribution system to find the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously accounting for technical constraints (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits, maximum total harmonic distortion limit and maximum permissible total size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). Practical value. For investigated distribution system, applying of all three optimization techniques simultaneously with THD constraint would be reduce the active power losses from 7.4 % to 3.5 % and energy losses – from 5 % to 2.38 % (approximately twice). In this case, the total annual saving would be about $700000 and the total saving for remaining period – about $4.8 million.Цель. В работе приведены селективный метод роя частиц и результаты его применения для решения проблемы совместной оптимизации мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников реальной распределительной сети, которая содержит 3 подстанции, 37 фидеров, 274 узла, 284 ветви и 11 нормально разомкнутых коммутационных аппаратов, и расположена в восточной части города Мариуполь. Методика. Селективный метод роя частиц, представляющий собой простую модификацию бинарного метода роя частиц, предназначенную для поиска в выбранном пространстве решений, был использован для решения вышеуказанной проблемы, сформулированной как проблема многокритериальной частично целочисленной комбинаторной нелинейной оптимизации с ограничениями в виде равенств и неравенств. Для подтверждения эффективности предложенного алгоритма были использованы многочисленные тестовые и реальные схемы с различным количеством узлов, а селективный метод роя частиц сравнили с другими современными эвристическими методами и методами искусственного интеллекта (например, имитация отжига, генетические алгоритмы, алгоритм колонии муравьёв, нечёткая логика и др.). Чтобы реализовать предложенный алгоритм для моделирования реальной разветвлённой сети, в качестве вычислительного средства была использована среда MATLAB R2010a. Перед началом моделирования с помощью анализатора качества электроэнергии Fluke 435 на четырёх фидерах с наибольшими потерями активной мощности и падением напряжения были проведены длительные (в течение одной недели) измерения активной и реактивной мощности, коэффициента мощности, несинусоидальности и несимметрии напряжений. Результаты. Результаты моделирования до и после оптимизации продемонстрировали эффективность применения селективного метода роя частиц для снижения потерь активной мощности и электроэнергии, улучшения качества напряжения и получения суммарной годовой экономии. Выполнено сравнительное исследование трёх приведенных выше методов оптимизации параметров разветвлённой распределительной сети (установка батарей конденсаторов, реконфигурация и замена сечений проводников). Научная новизна. Предложенный алгоритм был реализован для оптимизации параметров реальной разветвлённой распределительной сети с целью совместного определения оптимальных мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников, учитывая технические ограничения (максимально допустимый ток, максимально и минимально допустимые напряжения, максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению и максимально допустимое значение суммарной установленной мощности батарей конденсаторов) и эксплуатационные ограничения (отсутствие отключенных нагрузок и радиальная структура сети). Практическая значимость. Применение для исследуемой распределительной сети всех трёх методов оптимизации одновременно с учётом ограничения на максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению позволило бы снизить потери активной мощности с 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а потери электроэнергии – с 5 % до 2,38 % (примерно в 2 раза). В этом случае суммарная годовая экономия составила бы около 700000 $, а суммарная экономия за остаточный период – около 4,8 млн. $.Мета. В роботі наведені селективний метод рою частинок та результати його застосування щодо вирішення проблеми спільної оптимізації місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників реальної розподільної мережі, яка містить 3 підстанції, 37 фідерів, 274 вузли, 284 гілки та 11 нормально розімкнених комутаційних апаратів і розташована у східній частині міста Маріуполь.Методика. Селективний метод рою частинок, який є простою модифікацією бінарного методу рою частинок, призначеною для пошуку у обраному просторі розв'язань, був застосований щодо вирішення зазначеної вище проблеми, сформульованої як проблема багатокритеріальної частково цілочислової комбінаторної нелінійноїоптимізації з обмеженнями у вигляді рівностей та нерівностей. Для підтвердження ефективності запропонованого алгоритму були використані численні тестові та реальні схеми з різною кількістю вузлів, а селективний метод рою частинок був порівняний з іншими сучасними евристичними методами та методами штучного інтелекту (наприклад, імітація відпалу, генетичні алгоритми, алгоритм колонії мурашів, нечітка логіка та ін.). Щоби реалізувати запропонований алгоритм для моделювання реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі, у якості обчислювального засобу було застосовано середовище MATLAB R2010a. Перед початком моделювання за допомогою аналізатору якості електроенергії Fluke 435 на чотирьох фідерах з найбільшими втратами активної потужності та спадом напруги були виконані тривалі (протягом одного тижня) вимірювання активної та реактивної потужності, коефіцієнту потужності, несинусоїдності та несиметрії напруг. Результати. Результати моделювання до та після оптимізації продемонстрували ефективність застосування селективного методу рою частинок для зниження втрат активної потужності та електроенергії, покращення якості напруги та отримання сумарної річної економії. Виконано порівняльне дослідження трьох зазначених вище методів оптимізації параметрів розгалуженої розподільної мережі (встановлення батарей конденсаторів, реконфігурація та заміна перерізів провідників). Наукова новизна. Запропонований алгоритм був реалізований для оптимізації параметрів реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі з метою спільного знаходження оптимальних місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників, враховуючи технічні обмеження (максимально припустимий струм, максимально та мінімально припустимі напруги, максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою та максимально припустиме значення сумарної встановленої потужності батарей конденсаторів) та експлуатаційні обмеження (відсутність вимкнених навантажень та радіальна структура мережі). Практична значимість. Застосування для досліджуваної розподільної мережі всіх трьох методів оптимізації разом з урахуванням обмеження на максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою дозволило би знизити втрати активної потужності з 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а втрати електроенергії – з 5 % до 2,38 % (приблизно у 2 рази). У цьому випадку сумарна щорічна економія склала би приблизно 700000 $, а сумарна економія за залишковий період – приблизно 4,8 млн. $",Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Acad.

275621055,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Different track typologies compel different dynamic behaviors. Thus, the sleepers' material can play a key role in the wheel-rail contact forces and vibration generation phenomena. Furthermore, this situation can be increased if the vehicle speed is varied, accelerating track damages and maintenance operations. In order to assess the influence of sleepers' materials and vehicle speed on the vibration generation phenomenon, this paper develops a vehicle-track interaction model by means of a Finite Elements model in ANSYS commercial software. The numerical model is calibrated and validated with real data and then used to compare the different response of a ballasted track with concrete and wooden sleepers and accelerating and braking trains in both time and frequency domains. The results indicate the importance of sleepers' stiffness in the vibration generation phenomenon as well as the low sensitivity of vertical deflections to variations in the train speed.Montalban Domingo, ML.; Zamorano-Martín, C.; Morales-Ivorra, S.; Real Herráiz, JI.

35461179,2005-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper describes a model of design, which takes a different perspective in that it emphasises mechanisms and constraints. The model accommodates design-related activities from the enterprise level through to activities of individuals (e.g. decision-making processes), and provides a holistic treatment of existing design methods. It is suggested that the output of a design stage is not so much the input to the next, as the provider of constraints. Consequently, the creative component of design is not concentrated in one task, with the others being technician tasks: instead each of the tasks augments the design in a creative way. A degree of commonality was observed across different domains and stages of design, which leads to the proposal of a generic design activity (GDA), that can be used in diverse design situations. Sub-activities within the GDA were identified as the generation of candidate solutions, solution assessment, solution selection, implementation, and retrieval of design intent. It is suggested that one of the limitations of many design tools, especially artificial intelligence, is the reliance on on complete problem and constraint specification. In real situations, designers have to determine constraints from incomplete and qualitative specifications, using subjective processes. Furthermore, they subsequently have to negotiate with others for the relaxation of constraints, as the design space may be over-constrained. This negotiation involves interaction with others, and adds the organisational behaviour factors to the design process. Decision-making during design needs to be able to accommodate multiple viewpoints, cope with uncertainty of analysis (incompleteness of knowledge), propagate uncertain variables, and accommodate varying degrees of information abstraction. Other areas of design that may benefit for additional research are identified",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Design mechanisms and constraints,10.1007/s00163-005-0008-9,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
88287197,2011-10-29T00:00:00,"Part 1: Decision Support Systems, Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence ApplicationsInternational audienceData collected by measuring farmland environmental indicators are vital sources of agricultural information. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been employed to acquire stable and real time farmland environment data. WSNs, recognized as one of the latest development trends, recently attracted widespread attention and application due to their relative economy, stability, and sophistication. In this study, based upon a large amount of WSNs-obtained data, Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and ESRI ArcGIS Engine 9.3, amongst others, were utilized to develop a farmland test data processing system, resolve information storage and utilization problems and conduct system applications. The data processing software consisted of four modules: data receiving conversion, database maintenance management, data browsing analysis and the generation and application of data spatialization outputs. Specifically, the data receiving conversion module was mainly responsible for converting raw data acquired by WSNs into standard database outputs, including the automatic reception of measured value, error correction and alerting the observer to abnormal data. The Database maintenance management module’s primary functions were the generation and maintenance of metadata generated from stored data, authentic data enquiry, display and analysis. The generation and application of data spatialization products module was principally for the spatial expansion application of measured data, including space-time interpolation and conversion. The system underwent pilot scale testing and improvement at the same time as undertaking the processing of real data collected by WSNs deployed throughout the Hebi test zone. The observed results revealed that the system was able to complete real-time conversion and management of field measured data. In addition, it has several advantages, such as, excellent stability, perfect functionality and a convenient human - machine interface",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Development and Application of a Farmland Test Data Processing System Designed for Wireless Sensor Network Applications,10.1007/978-3-642-27281-3_22,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

29456730,2006-11-20T00:00:00,"This article presents a soft-computing-based data mining technique that addresses methodology aspects on extracting classification rules characterized by ellipsoidal regions in feature space. Self-organizing mapping and statistical techniques are employed to initialize the rules. A regularization model embedding some information on recognition rate and generalization ability is presented for refining the initial rules. Rule optimization is implemented for each individual rule using an evolutionary strategy. To generate rules for patterns with low probability of occurrence but considerable conceptual importance, a multilayer structure of rule generation and use is proposed. Simulation results are carried out by three benchmark data sets, and compared with other data mining tools and classifiers, such as decision trees, BRAINNE (Building Representations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Neural Networks), support vector machine, and neural networks. Our technique demonstrates its power and potential for real-world applications. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

211485892,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The twelve papers included in this special issue represent a selection of extended contributions presented at the Sixth International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications, held in Salamanca, Spain, 6–8th April, 2011. Papers were selected on the basis of fundamental ideas and concepts rather than the direct usage of well-established techniques. This special issue is then aimed at practitioners, researchers and post-graduate students, who are engaged in developing and applying advanced Soft Computing Models to solving real-world problems in the Industrial and Environmental fields. The papers are organized as follows. In the first contribution, Graña and Gonzalez-Acuña develop a formulation of dendritic classifiers based on lattice kernels and train them using a direct Monte Carlo approach and a Sparse Bayesian Learning. The results of both kinds of training are compared with the Relevance Vector Machines on a collection of benchmark datasets. In the second contribution by Irigoyen and Miñano, the authors present the results of the identification of the relationship in time, between the required exercise (machine resistance) and the heart rate of the patient in medical effort tests, using a NARX neural network model. In the experimental stage, test data have been obtained by exercising with a cyclo-ergometer in two different tests: Power Step Response and Conconi. Carneiro et al. in the third contribution present a biologically inspired method to deal with the problem in which genetic algorithms are used to create possible solutions for a given dispute. The approach presented is able to generate a broad number of diverse solutions that cover virtually the whole search space for a given problem. The results of this work are being applied in a negotiation tool that is part of the UMCourt conflict resolution platform. In the fourth contribution by Donate et al., they propose a novel Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) approach, where a weighted n-fold validation fitness scheme is used to build an ensemble of neural networks, under four different combination methods: mean, median, softmax and rank-based combinations. Several experiments were held, using six real-world time series with different characteristics and from distinct domains. Overall, the proposed approach achieved competitive results when compared with non weighted n-fold EANN ensembles, the simpler 0-fold EANN and also the popular Holt–Winters statistical method. Dan Burdescu et al. in the fifth contribution, present a system used in the medical domain for three distinct tasks: image annotation, semantic based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. An original image segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure was used to perform the segmentation of medical images. Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. The annotation and semantic based retrieval task is evaluated for two annotation models: Cross Media Relevance Model and Continuous-space Relevance Model. Semantic based image retrieval is performed using the methods provided by the annotation models. The ontology used by the annotation process was created in an original manner starting from the information content provided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The experiments were made using a database containing colour images retrieved from medical domain using an endoscope and related to digestive diseases. In sixth paper by Pedraza et al., they develop a face recognition system based on soft computing techniques, which complies with privacy-by-design rules and defines a set of principles that context-aware applications (including biometric sensors) should contain to conform to European and US law. This research deals with the necessity to consider legal issues concerning privacy or human rights in the development of biometric identification in ambient intelligence systems. Clearly, context-based services and ambient intelligence (and the most promising research area in Europe, namely ambient assisted living, ALL) call for a major research effort on new identification procedures. The aim of the research by Redel-Macías et al. in paper seven is to develop a novel model which can be used in pass-by noise test in vehicles based on ensembles of hybrid Evolutionary Product Unit or Radial Basis function Neural Networks (EPUNN or ERBFNNs) at high frequencies. Statistical models and ensembles of hybrid EPUNN and ERBFNN approaches have been used to develop different noise identification models. The results obtained using different ensembles of hybrid EPUNNs and ERBFNNs show that the functional model and the hybrid algorithms proposed provide a very accurate identification compared to other statistical methodologies used to solve this regression problem. In the eighth paper, Wu et al. analyse the existence criterion of loop strategies, and then present some corollaries and theorems, by which the loop strategies and chain strategies can be found, also superfluous strategies and inconsistent strategies. It presents a ranking model that indicates the weak node in strategy set and it also introduces a probability-based model which is the basis of evaluation of strategy. Additionally, this research proposes a method to generate offensive strategy, and the statistic results of simulation game prove the validity of the method. Pop et al. in the ninth paper present an efficient hybrid heuristic algorithm obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a local–global approach to the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP) and a powerful local search procedure. The computational experiments on several benchmarks instances show that the hybrid algorithm is competitive to all of the known heuristics published to date. In the tenth paper Kramer et al. illustrate how methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting, and monitoring techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable, and smart energy grids. The study is based on the application of kernel methods like support vector regression and kernel density estimation as prediction methods. Furthermore, dimension reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of high-dimensional wind time series are applied. The methods are briefly introduced, related work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The experimental parts are based on real wind energy time series data from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Vera et al. in the eleventh contribution present a novel soft computing procedure based on the application of artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms and identification systems, which makes it possible to optimise the implementation conditions in the manufacturing process of high precision parts, including finishing precision, while saving both time and financial costs and/or energy. The novel proposed approach was tested under real dental milling processes using a high precision machining centre with five axes, requiring high finishing precision of measures in micrometres with a large number of process factors to analyse. The results of the experiment, which validate the performance of the proposed approach, are presented in this study. The final contribution, by Sakalauskas and Kriksciuniene, presents a research about financial market efficiency and to recognize major reversal points of long-term trend of stock market index, which could indicate forthcoming crisis or market raise periods. The study suggests a computational model of financial time series analysis, which combines several approaches of soft computing, including information efficiency evaluation methods (Shannon's entropy, Hurst exponent), neural networks and sensitivity analysis. The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behaviour, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index. The performance of neural network model is explored by applying sensitivity analysis and resulted in selecting smoothing parameters of the input variables. The experimental research investigates behaviour of the long-term trend of the three emerging financial markets within NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchange. Introduction of information efficiency measures improve ability of the model to recognize the approaching reversal of long-term trend from temporary market “nervousness” and can be useful for calibrating stock trading strategy.

203513227,2012-08-31,"AbstractA closed-form approximate maximum likelihood (AML) algorithm for estimating the position and velocity of a moving source is proposed by utilizing the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) measurements of a signal received at a number of receivers. The maximum likelihood (ML) technique is a powerful tool to solve this problem. But a direct approach that uses the ML estimator to solve the localization problem is exhaustive search in the solution space, and it is very computationally expensive, and prohibits real-time processing. On the basis of ML function, a closed-form approximate solution to the ML equations can be obtained, which can allow real-time implementation as well as global convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves better performance than the two-step weighted least squares (WLS) approach, which makes it possible to attain the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) at a sufficiently high noise level before the threshold effect occurs",Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

The application of neural networks in the optimum routing problem, in case of packet switched computer networks, where the goal is to minimize the average delays in the communication have been addressed.

The effectiveness of neural network is shown by the results of simulation of a neural design to solve the shortest path problem. Simulation model of neural network is shown to be utilized in an optimum routing algorithm known as flow deviation algorithm. It is also shown that the model will enable the routing algorithm to be implemented in real time and also to be adaptive to changes in link costs and network topology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

53306093,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Gli elementi che indignarono gli aderenti al movimento del 15M erano connessi alla politica dettata dall\u2019austerity, alla disoccupazione record, alla precarizzazione dei giovani con l\u2019incremento dei contratti a termine, alle misure di ristrutturazione e riduzione dello Stato sociale, attuate allora dal Governo Zapatero su pressione di BCE e FMI, e appoggiate dal Partito Popolare. Un forte sdegno investiva inoltre una classe politica percepita come altamente corrotta in un Paese in crisi (nel 2009 \u2013 c\u2019erano stati ben 730 processi pendenti a carico di amministratori pubblici, con il primato del PSOE con 264 casi di corruzione aperti, seguito dai 200 casi del PP). Gi\ue0 nel giugno 2011 si assiste ad una europeizzazione della protesta e ad una diversificazione della base sociale e generazionale del movimento. I problemi denunciati si acuiscono con il governo Rajoy. Sotto accusa \ue8 la scarsa credibilit\ue0 della classe politica, asservita alle politiche imposte dai centri decisionali del capitalismo internazionale che di fatto rendono omogenee le scelte di maggioranza e opposizione. Proprio nel rivendicare la possibilit\ue0 di operare scelte differenti, proponendo nuovi modelli, sta la ragion d\u2019essere di Podemos che aspira a interrompere il processo di degrado che attraversa la democrazia rappresentativa attraverso l\u2019introduzione di forme di democrazia partecipativa e deliberativa, contro il bipartitismo dei maggiori partiti accusati di avere \u201csequestrato la democrazia\u201d. 
Il percorso partito dalla manifestazione a Puerta del Sol del 15 maggio 2011, dal presidio permanente (Acampada) alla rete nazionale di Democracia Real Ya, si sviluppa nella scelta di competere alle europee con un proprio partito, arrivando ai primi successi elettorali di Podemos, sino ai consensi alle amministrative del 24M. Il paper si interrogher\ue0 sulle modalit\ue0 del processo di istituzionalizzazione del movimento spagnolo, sul suo percorso di trasformazione organizzativa (con un particolare focus sui processi decisionali adottati) e programmatica, sull\u2019evoluzione delle priorit\ue0 politiche, sulla formulazione dei discorsi rivolti all\u2019elettorato e sul tipo di comunicazione adottata, sugli elementi distintivi che ne mantengono l\u2019identit\ue0 anche dopo la problematica scelta delle alleanze, sulle analogie e le differenze rispetto al tradizionale discorso culturale della sinistra. Si tenter\ue0 infine di comparare quanto sta accadendo in Spagna con un pi\uf9 generale processo di cambiamento che sta investendo movimenti e partiti negli altri Paesi europei.The elements that outraged the members of the 15M movement were connected to the austerity policy, to the record of unemployment, to the increase of uncertainty among young people with temporary works, to the restructuring measures and reduction of the welfare state (implemented by the Government Zapatero on ECB and IMF pressure, and supported by the Popular Party). A strong indignation also invested a political class perceived as highly corrupt in a country in crisis (in 2009 - there were 730 pending trials against public officials, with the primacy of the PSOE with 264 corruption cases opened, followed by 200 cases of PP). Already in June 2011, there was the Europeanization of protest and a changing in the social and  generational base of the movement. The reported problems are exacerbated by the Rajoy government. They blame the lack of credibility of the political class, subservient to the policies imposed by the decision-making centers of international capitalism that make similar the majority and the opposition choices. Claiming the right of operating different choices, Podemos propose new models aspiring to stop the degradation process of representative democracy through the introduction of forms of participatory and deliberative democracy, against the bipartisanship the major parties accused of having ""kidnapped democracy"".
The route started from the demonstration in the Puerta del Sol on 15th May 2011, from the permanent protest (Acampada) to the Democracia Real Ya national network, they developed the idea of competing at European elections with their party, arriving to the first electoral successes of Podemos and to the consensus of the administrative (on 24th May). The paper will question the process of institutionalization of the Spanish movement, studying its organizational transformation path (with a particular focus on the adopted decision-making processes), its policy priorities, its communication, its distinctive characteristics that maintain the identity. The paper analyzes the problem of choosing alliances and the similarities and differences comparing to the traditional discourses of the left wing parties. Finally, we try to compare what is happening in Spain with a more general process of change that is affecting movements and parties in other European countries",,Dal 15M al 24M: il maggio spagnolo da Democracia Real Ya (DRY) a Podemos,,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A single precision QP-on-a-chip controller is proposed, implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with an iterative linear solver at its core. A novel offline scaling procedure is introduced to aid the convergence of the reduced precision solver. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental setup where an ML605 FPGA board controls a nonlinear model of a Boeing 747 aircraft running on a desktop PC through an Ethernet link.

Little has changed over the past several decades regarding immediate posthemorrhage surveillance, and there has likewise been no significant improvement in outcomes.
Objective: To develop and test an endoscopically implantable wireless biosensor for real-time detection of fluorescein-labeled blood in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models of UGIB.
Setting: Animal laboratory. Design: Benchtop and acute animal studies. Subjects: Five pigs. Interventions: UGIB models were surgically created in living pigs. Biosensors were endoscopically deployed in the stomach using standard endoscopic clips. The ability to detect acute UGIB and estimated blood loss leading to biosensor activation were recorded. Feasibility of wireless data transmission out of the body to an
external computer and cell phone was assessed. Main Outcome Measurements: Technical feasibility and immediate complications. Results: A porcine UGIB model was successfully created. Biosensors were able to detect all acute bleeding events and wirelessly transmit out of the body, and successfully sent an emergency text message to the intended
cell phone in all cases. Average estimated blood loss leading to biosensor activation was 30 mL (10 –75 mL). Limitations: Animal study; small numbers.

275613405,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"The inclusion of embedded sensors into a networked system provides useful
information for many applications. A Distributed Control System (DCS) is one of the
clearest examples where processing and communications are constrained by the client s
requirements and the capacity of the system. An embedded sensor with advanced
processing and communications capabilities supplies high level information, abstracting
from the data acquisition process and objects recognition mechanisms. The implementation
of an embedded sensor/actuator as a Smart Resource permits clients to access sensor
information through distributed network services. Smart resources can offer sensor services
as well as computing, communications and peripheral access by implementing a self-aware
based adaptation mechanism which adapts the execution profile to the context. On the
other hand, information integrity must be ensured when computing processes are
dynamically adapted. Therefore, the processing must be adapted to perform tasks in a
certain lapse of time but always ensuring a minimum process quality. In the same way,
communications must try to reduce the data traffic without excluding relevant information.
The main objective of the paper is to present a dynamic configuration mechanism to adapt
the sensor processing and communication to the client s requirements in the DCS. This
paper describes an implementation of a smart resource based on a Red, Green, Blue, and

323091063,2013-04-07T00:00:00,"[ES] Los sistemas con conmutación de modos se definen como aquéllos que pueden exhibir diferente comportamiento dinámico en función del estado en que se encuentran. Pueden por tanto ser descritos por un conjunto finito de subsistemas dinámicos y una lógica que rige la conmutación entre ellos. Una alternativa para su control es la arquitectura multi-controlador con supervisión ya que permite utilizar controladores de modo diferentes y alcanzar así múltiples objetivos de control. Pero la conmutación de controladores suele tener como consecuencia la aparición de saltos o transitorios derivados que pueden ser inaceptables. Este tipo de sistemas y problemática son frecuentes en diferentes áreas de aplicación industrial, en donde la tecnología de control más utilizada es el Controlador Lógico Programable (PLC). Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo es presentar un método de diseño e implementación de un mecanismo de transferencia sin salto (BT) en una arquitectura multi-modo y multi-bucle para sistemas con conmutación de modos, en PLC y en conformidad con el estándar IEC 61131-3. La estrategia BT se basa en que controladores de modos candidatos a conmutar realicen un seguimiento a los controladores activos, siendo la detección del estado de operación actual y de los posibles estados siguientes, clave en la definición de la forma de ejecución de los algoritmos de control que componen la arquitectura. Se presentan también los pasos del diseño de la arquitectura completa así como resultados experimentales que validan la arquitectura.[EN] Switched mode systems are defined as those represented by a finite set of linear subsystems and a set of logic rules orchestrating the switching among them. A set of dynamic subsystems together with a logical system that orchestrates the switching among them could be used in order to describe it. An alternative to control them is a supervisory multi-mode controller architecture that allows to meeting multiple control objectives. But switching can consequently derived in bumps or undesirable transient responses. This type of problem is commonly encountered in several industrial application fields, where the Programmable Logic Controller (PLCs) is the most used technology. This paper describes a methodology for the design and the implementation of Bumpless Transfer (BT) mechanisms within multi-rate control architecture for switched mode systems, to be implemented in PLC following the IEC 61131-3 standard. The BT strategy is based on to make controllers which are candidate to switch track to active controllers. By detecting the system state and the feasible next states, the supervisor decides the way in which the different controllers of the architecture execute. The steps to design the complete architecture are presented and experimental results that validate the architecture are shown.MCYT y FEDER a través de los proyectos DPI2012-37806-C02-01, UPV/EHU GIU 10/20 y UFI11/28.Iriondo, N.; Estévez, E.; Priego, R.; Marcos, M.

18540517,2013-05-01T00:00:00,"The current challenge in automatic brain tumor classification based on MRS is the improvement of the robustness of the classification models that explicitly account for the probable breach of the independent and identically distributed conditions in the MRS data points. To contribute to this purpose, a new algorithm for the extraction of discriminant MRS features of brain tumors based on a functional approach is presented. Functional data analysis based on region segmentation (RSFDA) is based on the functional data analysis formalism using nonuniformly distributed B splines according to spectral regions that are highly correlated. An exhaustive characterization of the method is presented in this work using controlled and real scenarios. The performance of RSFDA was compared with other widely used feature extraction methods. In all simulated conditions, RSFDA was proven to be stable with respect to the number of variables selected and with respect to the classification performance against noise and baseline artifacts. Furthermore, with real multicenter datasets classification, RSFDA and peak integration (PI) obtained better performance than the other feature extraction methods used for comparison. Other advantages of the method proposed are its usefulness in selecting the optimal number of features for classification and its simplified functional representation of the spectra, which contributes to highlight the discriminative regions of the MR spectrum for each classification task. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The authors gratefully acknowledge former INTERPRET and eTUMOUR European project partners.

The use of standards in the implementation of an intelligent distributed system is always advantageous. This paper presents a middleware that provides support to a multi-agent system. Middleware is based on the standard Data Distribution Services (DDS), proposed by Object Management Group (OGM). Middleware organizes information by tree based ontology and provides a set of quality of service policies that agents can use to increase efficiency. DDS provides a set of quality of service policy. Joining quality of service policy and the ontology allows getting many advantages, among others the possibility of to conceal some details of the communications system to agents, the correct location of the agents in the distributed system, or the monitoring agents in terms of quality of service.

187722098,2014-01-01T00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence methodologies, as the core of discrete control and decision support systems, have been extensively applied
in the industrial production sector. The resulting tools produce excellent results in certain cases; however, the NP-hard nature of
many discrete control or decision making problems in the manufacturing area may require unaffordable computational resources,
constrained by the limited available time required to obtain a solution. With the purpose of improving the efficiency of a control
methodology for discrete systems, based on a simulation-based optimization and the Petri net (PN) model of the real discrete
event dynamic system (DEDS), this paper presents a strategy, where a transformation applied to the model allows removing the
redundant information to obtain a smaller model containing the same useful information. As a result, faster discrete optimizations
can be implemented.This methodology is based on the use of a formalism belonging to the paradigmof thePNfor describingDEDS,
the disjunctive colored PN. Furthermore, the metaheuristic of genetic algorithms is applied to the search of the best solutions in
the solution space. As an illustration of the methodology proposal, its performance is compared with the classic approach on a case
study, obtaining faster the optimal solution",'Hindawi Limited',Control of discrete event systems by means of discrete optimization and disjunctive colored PNs: application to manufacturing facilities,10.1155/2014/821707,https://core.ac.uk/download/187722098.pdf,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
80739260,2015-06-03T00:00:00,"Nowadays, even though cognitive control architectures form an important area of research, there are many constraints on the broad application of cognitive control at an industrial level and very few systematic approaches truly inspired by biological processes, from the perspective of control engineering. Thus, our main purpose here is the emulation of human socio-cognitive skills, so as to approach control engineering problems in an effective way at an industrial level. The artificial cognitive control architecture that we propose, based on the shared circuits model of socio-cognitive skills, seeks to overcome limitations from the perspectives of computer science, neuroscience and systems engineering. The design and implementation of artificial cognitive control architecture is focused on four key areas: (i) self-optimization and self-leaning capabilities by estimation of distribution and reinforcement-learning mechanisms; (ii) portability and scalability based on low-cost computing platforms; (iii) connectivity based on middleware; and (iv) model-driven approaches. The results of simulation and real-time application to force control of micro-manufacturing processes are presented as a proof of concept. The proof of concept of force control yields good transient responses, short settling times and acceptable steady-state error. The artificial cognitive control architecture built into a low-cost computing platform demonstrates the suitability of its implementation in an industrial setup",'Elsevier BV',Artificial cognitive control with self-x capabilities: A case study of a micro-manufacturing process,10.1016/j.compind.2015.05.001,http://oa.upm.es/43641/1/INVE_MEM_2015_235909.pdf,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Our research project aims to use data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods for monitoring students in e-learning trainings. This project takes the shape of a partnership between computer science / artificial intelligence researchers and an IT firm specialized in e-learning software. We wish to create a system that will gather and process all data related to a particular e-learning course. To make monitoring easier, we will provide reliable statistics, behaviour groups and predicted results as a basis for an intelligent virtual tutor using the mentioned methods. This system will be described in this article. In this step of the project, we are clustering students by mining Moodle log data. A first objective is to define relevant clustering features. We will describe and evaluate our proposal. A second objective is to determine if our students show different learning behaviours. We will experiment whether there is an overall ideal number of clusters and whether the clusters show mostly qualitative or quantitative differences. Experiments in clustering were carried out using real data obtained from various courses dispensed by a partner institute using a Moodle platform. We have compared several classic clustering algorithms on several group of students using our defined features and analysed the meaning of the clusters they produced",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Clustering Moodle data as a tool for profiling students,10.1109/ICeLeTE.2013.6644359,https://core.ac.uk/download/78384918.pdf,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
58795057,2011-11-01T00:00:00,"Autonomy is a prime issue on robotics field and it is closely related to decision making. Last researches on decision making for social robots are focused on biologically inspired mechanisms for taking decisions. Following this approach, we propose a motivational system for decision making, using internal (drives) and external stimuli for learning to choose the right action. Actions are selected from a finite set of skills in order to keep robot's needs within an acceptable range. The robot uses reinforcement learning in order to calculate the suitability of every action in each state. The state of the robot is determined by the dominant motivation and its relation to the objects presents in its environment. The used reinforcement learning method exploits a new algorithm called Object Q-Learning. The proposed reduction of the state space and the new algorithm considering the collateral effects (relationship between different objects) results in a suitable algorithm to be applied to robots living in real environments. In this paper, a first implementation of the decision making system and the learning process is implemented on a social robot showing an improvement in robot's performance. The quality of its performance will be determined by observing the evolution of the robot's wellbeing.The funds provided by the Spanish Government through the project called “Peer

226662482,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"The MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) instrument on the Envisat (Environmental satellite) satellite has provided vertical profiles of the atmospheric composition on a global scale for almost ten years. The MIPAS mission is divided in two phases: the full resolution phase, from 2002 to 2004, and the optimized resolution phase, from 2005 to 2012, which is characterized by a finer vertical and horizontal sampling attained through a reduction of the spectral resolution.

While the description and characterization of the products of the ESA processor for the full resolution phase has been already described in previous papers, in this paper we focus on the performances of the latest version of the ESA (European Space Agency) processor, named ML2PP V6 (MIPAS Level 2 Prototype Processor), which has been used for reprocessing the entire mission. The ESA processor had to perform the operational near real time analysis of the observations and its products needed to be available for data assimilation. Therefore, it has been designed for fast, continuous and automated analysis of observations made in quite different atmospheric conditions and for a minimum use of external constraints in order to avoid biases in the products.

The dense vertical sampling of the measurements adopted in the second phase of the MIPAS mission resulted in sampling intervals finer than the instantaneous field of view of the instrument. Together with the choice of a retrieval grid aligned with the vertical sampling of the measurements, this made ill-conditioned the retrieval problem of the MIPAS operational processor. This problem has been handled with minimal changes to the original retrieval approach but with significant improvements nonetheless. The Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method, already present in the retrieval scheme for its capability to provide fast convergence for nonlinear problems, is now also exploited for the reduction of the ill-conditioning of the inversion. An expression specifically designed for the regularizing Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method has been implemented for the computation of the covariance matrices and averaging kernels of the retrieved products. The regularization of the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method is controlled by the convergence criteria and is deliberately kept weak. The resulting oscillations of the retrieved profile are a posteriori damped by an innovative self-adapting Tikhonov regularization. The convergence criteria and the weakness of the self-adapting regularization ensure that minimum constraints are used and the best vertical resolution obtainable from the measurements is achieved in all atmospheric conditions.

Random and systematic errors, as well as vertical and horizontal resolution are compared in the two phases of the mission for all products, namely: temperature, H2O, O3, HNO3, CH4, N2O, NO2, CFC-11, CFC-12, N2O5 and ClONO2. The use in the two phases of the mission of different optimized sets of spectral intervals ensures that, despite the different spectral resolutions, comparable performances are obtained in the whole MIPAS mission in terms of random and systematic errors, while the vertical resolution and the horizontal resolution are significantly better in the case of the optimized resolution measurements",'Copernicus GmbH',Ten years of MIPAS measurements with ESA Level 2 processor V6 - Part 1: Retrieval algorithm and diagnostics of the products,10.5194/amt-6-2419-2013,,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Ello produce numerosas complicaciones a largo plazo como retinopatía, nefropatía y neuropatía entre otras. Las terapias actuales basadas en el suministro de insulina exógena (por inyecciones o bomba de insulina), no consiguen normalizar los niveles de glucosa de forma eficiente. Los avances tecnológicos en la última década en sistemas de medición continua de glucosa e infusión de insulina, han impulsado el desarrollo del páncreas artificial, o control automático de infusión de insulina. En este trabajo se presentará, a modo de tutorial, el pasado, presente y futuro de esta tecnología, tan esperada por el paciente diabético. Se revisará el estado actual de la tecnología para la sensorización y actuación, principales desafíos desde el punto de vista de control, las diferentes ``escuelas'' y estudios clínicos del desempeño de controladores, así como herramientas de validación de controladores mediante simulación. Dada la complejidad del problema, el desarrollo del páncreas artificial será de forma escalonada, redundando progresivamente en la mejora de la calidad de vida del paciente. Los grandes avances en los últimos cinco años hacen preveer un horizonte cercano para la primera generación de páncreas artificial.[EN] Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that affects approximately to 30 million people worldwide and is characterized by high blood glucose concentration levels produced by an absolute deficiency of insulin. That produces numerous long-term complications like retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy among others. Current therapies based on the exogenous delivery of insulin (through injections or an insulin pump), do not manage to normalize the glucose levels efficiently. Technological advances in the last decade in continuous glucose monitoring and insulin infusion have been a springboard for the development of the artificial pancreas, or automatic control of insulin infusion. In this work, the past, present and future of this technology, so long awaited by the diabetic patient, will be presented in the form of a tutorial. Current technology for sensorization and actuation will be reviewed, as well as main challenges from the control point of view, different “schools of thought” and clinical studies for controllers performance evaluation, and tools for the validation of controllers through simulation. Due to the complexity of the problem, the development of the artificial pancreas will be staggered, resulting progressively in an improvement of the patient’s quality of life.

The basic controllers of the architecture are the emotional processes that decide which behaviors of the robot must activate to fulfill the objectives. The number of emotional processes increases (hundreds of millions/s) with the complexity level of the application, reducing the processing capacity of the main processor to solve complex problems (millions of decisions in a given instant). However, the potential parallelism of the emotional processes permits their execution in parallel on FPGAs or Multicores, thus enabling slack computing in the main processor to tackle more complex dynamic problems. In this paper, an emotional architecture for mobile robotic agents is presented. The workload of the emotional processes is evaluated. Then, the main processor is extended with FPGA co-processors through Ethernet link. The FPGAs will be in charge of the execution of the emotional processes in parallel. Different Stratix FPGAs are compared to analyze their suitability to cope with the proposed mobile robotic agent applications. The applications are set up taking into account different environmental conditions, robot dynamics and emotional states. Moreover, the applications are run also on Multicore processors to compare their performance in relation to the FPGAs. Experimental results show that Stratix IV FPGA increases the performance in about one order of magnitude over the main processor and solves all the considered problems. Quad-Core increases the performance in 3.64 times, allowing to tackle about 89 % of the considered problems. Quad-Core has a lower cost than a Stratix IV, so more adequate solution but not for the most complex application. Stratix III could be applied to solve problems with around the double of the requirements that the main processor could support. Finally, a Dual-Core provides slightly better performance than stratix III and it is relatively cheaper.This work was supported in part under Spanish Grant PAID/2012/325 of ""Programa de Apoyo a la Investigacion y Desarrollo.

78071095,2015-06-01T00:00:00,"We present a wearable system that uses ambient electromagnetic interference (EMI) as a signature to identify electronic devices and support proxemic interaction. We designed a low cost tool, called EMI Spy, and a software environment for rapid deployment and evaluation of ambient EMI-based interactive infrastructure. EMI Spy captures electromagnetic interference and delivers the signal to a user's mobile device or PC through either the device's wired audio input or wirelessly using Bluetooth. The wireless version can be worn on the wrist, communicating with the user;s mobile device in their pocket. Users are able to train the system in less than 1 second to uniquely identify displays in a 2-m radius around them, as well as to detect pointing at a distance and touching gestures on the displays in real-time. The combination of a low cost EMI logger and an open source machine learning tool kit allows developers to quickly prototype proxemic, touch-to-connect, and gestural interaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of mobile, EMI-based device and gesture recognition with preliminary user studies in 3 scenarios, achieving 96% classification accuracy at close range for 6 digital signage displays distributed throughout a building, and 90% accuracy in classifying pointing gestures at neighboring desktop LCD displays. We were able to distinguish 1- and 2-finger touching with perfect accuracy and show indications of a way to determine power consumption of a device via touch. Our system is particularly well-suited to temporary use in a public space, where the sensors could be distributed to support a popup interactive environment anywhere with electronic devices. By designing for low cost, mobile, flexible, and infrastructure-free deployment, we aim to enable a host of new proxemic interfaces to existing appliances and displays",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',"EMI Spy: Harnessing electromagnetic interference for low-cost, rapid prototyping of proxemic interaction",10.1109/BSN.2015.7299402,https://core.ac.uk/download/78071095.pdf,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

is very important because their deterioration may cause the value lost and even
the product rejection by the buyer. For this reason, in this paper we present a
cooperative monitoring system for the delivery of fresh products. The system
consists of fixed wireless nodes and a mobile wireless node that is installed in
the packet. This mobile node is able to take data of the internal temperature,
external temperature and the 3 axis movement. With the information stored in
the network, a vendor can know the optimal conditions of the transport. Finally,
we test the maximum distance to the fixed nodes, as well as the data collected by
the sensor.Sendra, S.; Lloret, J.; Lacuesta, R.; Jimenez, JM. (2015). Cooperative Monitoring of the Delivery of Fresh Products.

80154109,2015-01-01T00:00:00,"Objective Several trials aimed at evaluating the efficacy of maternal hydration (MH) in increasing amniotic-fluid-volume (AFV) in pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios or normohydramnos have been conducted. Unfortunately, no evidences support this intervention in routineclinical- practice. The aim of this systematic-literature-review and meta-analysis was to collect all data regarding proposed strategies and their efficacy in relation to each clinical condition for which MH-therapy was performed with the aim of increasing amniotic-fluid (AF) and improving perinatal outcomes. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic-database MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane-Library in the time interval between 1991 and 2014. Following the identification of eligible trials, we estimated the methodological quality of each study (using QADAS-2) and clustered patients according to the following outcome measures: route of administration (oral versus intravenous versus combined), total daily dose of fluids administered (2000), duration of hydration therapy: (1 day, >1 day but 1 week), type of fluid administered (isotonic versus hypotonic versus combination). Results In isolated-oligohydramnios (IO), maternal oral hydration is more effective than intravenous hydration and hypotonic solutions superior to isotonic solutions. The improvement in AFV appears to be time-dependent rather than daily-dose dependent. Regarding normohydramnios pregnancies, all strategies seem equivalent though the administration of hypotonicfluid appears to have a slightly greater effect than isotonic-fluid. Regarding perinatal outcomes, data is fragmentary and heterogeneous and does not allow us to define the real clinical utility of MH. Conclusions Available data suggests that MH may be a safe, well-tolerated and useful strategy to improve AFV especially in cases of IO. In view of the numerous obstetric situations in which a reduced AFV may pose a threat, particularly to the fetus, the possibility of increasing AFV with a simple and inexpensive practice like MH-therapy may have potential clinical applications. Considering the various strategies of maternal hydration implemented in the treatment of IO, better results were observed when treatment was based on a combination of intravenous (for a period of 1 day) and oral (for a period of at least 14 days) hypotonic fluids ( 652000ml)",'Public Library of Science (PLoS)',An update on maternal hydration strategies for amniotic fluid improvement in isolated oligohydramnios and normohydramnios: Evidence from a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis,10.1371/journal.pone.0144334,https://core.ac.uk/download/80154109.pdf,,core,science,'science' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
34996308,2013-01-01T00:00:00,"Efficient and reliable simulation tools are essential for progress in brain research. Since the early days of neuronal computing (Farley & Clark, 1954), a wide range of simulators have been developed, each specialized on one or few spatial and temporal scales (Brette et al., 2007). But the reliable and reproducible simulation of such complex systems as the brain is a very demanding challenge. Thus, the Computational Neuroscience community concentrated on a few reliable and widely used simulation tools in recent years. Neuronal network simulation is thus coming of age: Just as our colleagues in electrophysiology, we begin to base our work increasingly on the use of standard tools, with modifications and adaptations for our particular research, instead of building home-brew solutions from scratch. This concentration was not least the result of a series of large-scale EU funded projects, such as FACETS, BrainScaleS and the recently announced Human Brain Project. From its humble beginnings as a PhD-student project 20 years ago, the Neural Simulation Tool NEST (Gewaltig & Diesmann, 2007) saw its first incarnation as the SYNOD simulator in 1995 (Diesmann et al., 1995), leading to exciting results on synfire chains early on (Diesmann et al., 1999). By tightly coupling software development with computational neuroscience research (Kunkel et al., 2010), simulator technology evolved steadily, facilitating new scientific insight at (nearly) every step. Some key examples were parallelization (Morrison et al., 2005; Plesser et al., 2007), exact integration of model equations (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999), precise spike times in a time-driven simulator (Morrison et al., 2007; Hanuschkin et al., 2010), spike- time-dependent (Morrison et al., 2007) and neuro-modulated plasticity (Potjans et al., 2010), and a Topology module for spatially structured networks (Plesser & Enger, 2013). Streamlined data-structures (Kunkel et al., 2011) allow NEST to efficiently exploit the capabilities of some of the largest computers on Earth for simula- tions on the brain scale (Helias et al., 2012). Systematic quality assurance through testsuites (Eppler et al., 2009) and continuous integration technology (Zaytsev & Morrison, 2013) ensure simulator reliability (within limits). With a user-friendly Python-based interface (Eppler et al., 2008; Gewaltig et al., 2012), integration with PyNN (Davison et al., 2008) for simulator-independent scripting and MUSIC support (Djurfeldt et al., 2010) for integrated multi-scale simulation, NEST is a powerful simulation tool for brain-scale simulations today. NEST has been publicly available since 2004 and has been taught at summer schools and graduate courses since, training a generation of computational scientists. This has lead to a steady increase in computational neuroscience publications based on NEST simulations in recent years (see http://www.nest-initiative.org for a list), indicating that NEST is indeed establishing itself as a widely used tool for the simulation of large networks of (comparatively) simple model neurons. As of the NEST 2.0 release in 2012, NEST is available under the GNU Public License to ensure wide dissemination. The further development of NEST is chaperoned by the NEST Initiative, a non-for-profit organization incorporated in Ecublens, Switzerland, which is open for interested scientists. We are currently preparing to move NEST source code to a distributed version control system, allowing all NEST users ”real time” access to bug fixes and improvements, and to facilitate contributions by the NEST Community. In our demonstration, we will illustrate the capabilities and versatility of NEST. We will in particular focus on three complementary approaches to simulating large-scale cortical networks: A data-driven approach based on detailed connectivity information (based on data from the Blue Brain Project), constructive network generation, based on connectivity patterns (Potjans & Diesmann, 2012), and simulation of advanced 3D topological networks.
