237183624,2020-01-01T00:00:00,"Parking vehicle is a daunting task and a common problem in many cities around the globe. The search for parking space leads to congestion, frustration and increased air pollution. Information of a vacant parking space would facilitate to reduce congestion and subsequent air pollution. Therefore, aim of the paper is to acquire vehicle occupancy in an open parking lot using deep learning. Thermal camera was used to collect the data during varying environmental conditions such as; sunny, dusk, dawn, dark and snowy conditions. Vehicle detection with deep learning was implemented where image classification and object localization were performed for multi object detection. The dataset consists of 527 images which were manually labelled as there were no pre-labelled thermal images available. Multiple deep learning networks such as Yolo, ReNet18, ResNet50 and GoogleNet with varying layers and architectures were evaluated on vehicle detection. Yolo, GoogleNet and ResNet18 are computationally efficient detectors which took less processing time while Resnet50 produced better detection results compared to other detectors. However, ResNet18 also produced minimal miss rates and is suitable for real time vehicle detection.

A representation of the long-term flows with related weather and contextual information is first introduced. A recurrent neural network approach, named RNN-LF, is then proposed to predict the long-term of flows from multiple data sources. Moreover, a parallel implementation on GPU of the proposed solution is developed (GRNN-LF), which allows to boost the performance of RNN-LF. Several experiments have been carried out on real traffic flow including a small city (Odense, Denmark) and a very big city (Beijing). The results reveal that the sequential version (RNN-LF) is capable of dealing effectively with traffic of small cities. They also confirm the scalability of GRNN-LF compared to the most competitive GPU-based software tools when dealing with big traffic flow such as Beijing urban data.publishedVersio",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',A recurrent neural network for urban long-term traffic flow forecasting,10.1007/s10489-020-01716-1,https://core.ac.uk/download/427469430.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
235261716,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,https://core.ac.uk/download/235261716.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Metodi: gli strumenti utilizzati sono quelli della pianificazione strategica e degli investimenti territoriali integrati, secondo una logica di intervento sulla struttura fisica della città coerente con la struttura demografica dei residenti e quindi capace di rispondere ai bisogni reali degli abitanti. I quartieri scelti per la sperimentazione sono “zone di margine” caratterizzati da una condizione di segregazione sociale e spaziale. Il modello di gestione è quello della medicina di iniziativa con intervento proattivo basato sulla partecipazione e coinvolgimento delle persone.

Risultati: i primi risultati mettono in evidenza che l’intervento messo in atto si presta particolarmente al coinvolgimento della popolazione anziana emarginata, che per presenza di barriere sociali, economiche, culturali ed ambientali, sottoutilizza o non si rivolge ai servizi di cura. Inoltre, alle azioni specifiche su target predefinito (ultra 70enni) vengono affiancate attività di promozione sociale del valore della salute e della cultura della responsabilità all’auto-cura individuale e collettiva.Objectives: the integration of health and social services is one of the most important issues for the municipal amministration of Cagliari which is building, restoration of functional abandoned buildings in neighborhoods with particular socio-economic problems to create Integrated Medical Information referred to as “health centers”, aimed particularly so for the elderly, but capable of having repercussions on the entire social structure of reference.

Methods: the instruments used are the strategic planning and investment territorial integrated, according to a logic of intervention on the physical structure of the city in line with the demographic structure of the residents and therefore able to respond to the real needs of the inhabitants. The districts chosen for testing are “marginal areas” characterized by a state of social and spatial segregation. The management model is one of medicine’s initiative with proactive intervention based on parteciapzione and involvement of people.

Results: the first results show that the intervention implemented is particularly the involvement of the elderly marginalized, that the presence of barriers to social, economic, and environmental culturalie, does not use care services.

While it can potentially impact every road user, professional drivers are perhaps the most affected collective as they spend a high amount of time in their vehicles on a daily basis, whether they deliver goods or transport people. Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using driver head rotation movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction can be used as a reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study.

We present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based change detection framework for locating changed building instances as well as changed building pixels from very high resolution (VHR) aerial images.

The framework consists two parts: a building extraction network to produce a binary building map and a building change detection network to produce a building change map. The building extraction network is implemented with two widely used structures: a Mask R-CNN for object-based instance segmentation, and a multi-scale full convolutional network for pixel-based semantic segmentation. The building change detection network takes bi-temporal building maps produced from the building extraction network as input and outputs a building change map at the object and pixel levels.

This greatly lowers the requirements of labeled changed buildings, and guarantees the algorithm's robustness to registration errors caused by parallaxes.

Several studies have recently demonstrated that actions focused only on the water supply side of the problem (e.g., augmenting existing water supply infrastructure) will likely fail to meet future demands, thus calling for the concurrent deployment of effective water demand management strategies (WDMS) to pursue water savings and conservation. However, to be effective WDMS do require a substantial understanding of water consumers' behaviors and consumption patterns at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Retrieving information on users' behaviors, as well as their explanatory and/or causal factors, is key to spot potential areas for targeting water saving efforts and to design user-tailored WDMS, such as education campaigns and personalized recommendations. In this work, we contribute a data-driven approach to identify household water users' consumption behavioural profiles and model their water use habits. State-of-the-art clustering methods are coupled with big data machine learning techniques with the aim of extracting dominant behaviors from a set of water consumption data collected at the household scale. This allows identifying heterogeneous groups of consumers from the studied sample and characterizing them with respect to several consumption features.

This paper focuses on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which consists of two aspects: determining desired demands at each station and designing routes to redistribute bikes among stations. For the first task, we firstly apply the random forest, a very efficient machine learning algorithm, to forecast desired demands for each station, which can be easily implemented with distributed computing.

Experiments on a public, real-life dataset are led here to evaluate carefully each of the choices that were made, with a specific emphasis on data fusion methods. Our most surprising finding is that none of the methods we implemented from the literature is better than a simple late fusion. Two important decisions are the choice of a sensor and the choice of a representation for the data: we found that using 2D convolutions on spectrograms with a logarithmic axis for the frequencies was better than 1-dimensional temporal representations.

516285774,2022-01-01T00:00:00,"International audienceApplications in which researchers aim to extract a single land type from remotely sensed data are quite common in practical scenarios: extract the urban footprint to make connections with socio-economic factors; map the forest extent to subsequently retrieve biophysical variables and detect a particular crop type to successively calibrate and deploy yield prediction models. In this scenario, the (positive) targeted class is well defined, while the negative class is difficult to describe. This one-class classification setting is also referred to as positive unlabelled learning (PUL) in the general field of machine learning. To deal with this challenging setting, when satellite image time series data are available, we propose a new framework named positive and unlabelled learning of satellite image time series (PUL-SITS). PUL-SITS involves two different stages: In the first one, a recurrent neural network autoencoder is trained to reconstruct only positive samples with the aim to higight reliable negative ones. In the second stage, both labelled and unlabelled samples are exploited in a semi-supervised manner to build the final binary classification model. To assess the quality of our approach, experiments were carried out on a real-world benchmark, namely Haute-Garonne, located in the southwest area of France. From this study site, we considered two different scenarios: a first one in which the process has the objective to map Cereals/Oilseeds cover versus the rest of the land cover classes and a second one in which the class of interest is the Forest land cover.

La colorización plantea un reto específico en visión computarizada para la reconstrucción de imágenes y video, tales como, la búsqueda de una fiel aproximación, la saturación correcta de colores escogidos y áreas no desfasadas.
La coloración  automatizada de imágenes ha sido abordada desde varios puntos, uno de esos es Image Analogies, en donde se aplican operaciones y filtros para abstraer e integrar características de unas imágenes a otra, lo cual requiere intervención humana para la escogencia de imágenes de referencia con características similares a la imagen que se desea colorear(Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). En intentos de mejorar la respuesta al problema se han presentado soluciones utilizando redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN) y se comienza a reducir la necesidad de semejanza directa entre las imágenes de entrenamiento y las de prueba, se plantea entonces como un problema de predicción del espacio de color (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).

Cayena, nuestra aplicación web presenta una galería de imágenes de la historia de Barranquilla y de forma interactiva permite realizarles el coloreado. Para aplicar el coloreado la aplicación genera una petición a nuestra API que que aloja el servicio y ejecuta el proceso de coloración; este proceso de coloración consiste en el procesamiento de la imagen para que tenga el tamaño adecuado, la transformación a escala de grises  y la posterior ejecución, por medio del marco de trabajo  de aprendizaje profundo Caffe, de un modelo de CNN pre-entrenado que predice los posibles colores reales de la imagen.Having a grayscale image as an input, colorization is the assignation of the possible colors to the objects composing the image so that the colors are similar to the real ones. Colorization poses a specific challenge on the field of computerized vision for image and video restoration, such as reliable approximation, an adequate saturation of the chosen colors and no mismatched areas.
Different approaches have been made to assess automated colorization of images, such as Image Analogies, where filters and operations are applied to obtain and integrate characterics from some images to other, which requires human intervention to choose reference images with similar characteristics to those of the image to be colorized (Gupta, R.K., Chia, A.Y.S., Rajan, D., Ng, E.S., Zhiyong, H, 2012). In attempts to get better outcomes, convolutional neural networks(CNN) have been presented, increasingly getting rid of the need of the direct image resemblance between training and test images, posing the problem of colorization as one of space color prediction (Zhang, Richard, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A., 2016).
We propose the design and implementation of a image restoration tool for historical images of the city of Barranquilla by applying a colorization using computer vision techniques. Cayena, our web application displays a gallery of historical images of Barranquilla and interactively allows to colorize them. In order to apply the colorization the application makes a request to our API that hosts the service and executes the colorization process; this colorization process consists in the processing of the image so it has the right size and the verification to make sure it is a grayscale image and transform it if it is not, and the subsequent execution of an pre trained CNN model using the Deep Learning framework ‘Caffe’ which predicts the possible real colors of the image","Barranquilla, Universidad del Norte, 2020",Automated colorization using Computer Vision tools for restoring historical images of the city of Barranquilla,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

By virtue of current business models adopted by manufacturers and ICT operators, IoT devices are deployed over various networked infrastructures with minimal security, opening up a range of new attack vectors. Conventional rule-based intrusion detection mechanisms used by network management solutions rely on pre-defined attack signatures and hence are unable to identify new attacks. In parallel, anomaly detection solutions tend to suffer from high false positive rates due to the limited statistical validation of ground truth data, which is used for profiling normal network behaviour. In this work we go beyond current solutions and leverage the coupling of anomaly detection and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with parallel processing for the profiling and detection of emerging cyber attacks. We demonstrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of Citrus: a novel intrusion detection framework which is adept at tackling emerging threats through the collection and labelling of live attack data by utilising diverse Internet vantage points in order to detect and classify malicious behaviour using graph-based metrics as well as a range of machine learning (ML) algorithms.

While it can potentially impact every road user, professional drivers are perhaps the most affected collective as they spend a high amount of time in their vehicles on a daily basis, whether they deliver goods or transport people. Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using driver head rotation movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction can be used as a reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study.

However, fuel cells and batteries have several operational challenges, which require a power and energy management system (PEMS) to achieve optimal performance. Most of the existing PEMS methods are based on either predefined rules or prediction that are not adaptive to real-time driving conditions and may give solutions that are far from the actual optimal solution for a new drive cycle. Therefore, in this paper, an intelligent PEMS using reinforcement learning is presented, that can autonomously learn the optimal policy in real time through interaction with the onboard hybrid power system. This PEMS is implemented and tested on the simulation model of the onboard hybrid power system. The propulsion load is represented by the new European drive cycle.

Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows  to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample.

268906452,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"Efficiency and safety are primary requirements for oil &amp; gas fluid filled transportation system. However, the complexity of the asset makes it challenging to derive a theoretical framework for managing the control parameters. The current frontier for a real time monitoring exploits the ""digital tansformation"", i.e. the acquisition and the analysis of large datasets recorded along the whole asset lifecycle, which are used to infer ""data driven"" relations and to predict the evolution of the asset integrity. This paper presents some results of a research project for the design, implementation and testing of a ""machine learning"" approach to vibroacoustic data recorded continuously by acquisition units installed every 10-20 km along a pipeline. In a fluid transportation system, vibroacoustic signals are generated by the flow regulation equipment (i.e. pumping, valves, metering), by the fluid flowing (i.e. turbulence, cavitation, bubbles), by third party interference (i.e. spillage, sabotage, illegal tapping), by internal inspection using PIGs operations), and by natural hazards (i.e. microseismic, subsidence, landslides). The basic principle of machine learning is to ""observe"", for an appropriate time interval, a series of descriptors, in this stage related to vibroacoustic signals but that can be integrated with other physical data (i.e. temperature, density, viscosity), in order to ""learn"" their safe range of variation or, when properly fed to a classification procedure, to obtain automatically a discrete set of operational status. The classification criteria are then applied to new data, highlighting the presence of system anomalies. The paper considers vibroacoustic signals collected at the flow stations of an oil trunkline in Nigeria. The vibroacoustic signals are the static pressure, the acceleration and the pressure transients recorded at the departure and at the arrival terminals. More than one year of data is available. Derived smart indicators are defined, which are directly linked to the asset parameters: for instance, the cross-correlation of the pressure transients at adjacent measuring locations permits to estimate the fluid channel continuity (correlation value), the sound velocity (time of correlation peak), and the sound attenuation (amplitude versus frequency amplitude decay). A portion of the data during normal operation is used for training and tuning a reference model. After that, new data are compared with the model, and anomalies are automatically detected. Two kind of errors are raised: i) sensors; ii) alerts. Sensor errors are referred to missing or corrupted sensors data. Alerts are raised when the measured physical quantities are not coherent with the functional and known service behaviors of the transport system. The system model is not static over time, and in fact it can be updated by the operators’ feedback, that can tag false alarms and thus, automatically, re-define the set of operational scenarios of the upstream system. The medium-long term construction and update of data driven models is effective for predictive maintenance, automatic anomalies detection, optimization of operational procedures. Moreover, the new policy of data management and the opportunity of gaining awareness by interconnecting the monitoring experience of different assets leverages the introduction of new technologies (cloud, big data), new professional figures (smart data scientist), new operational and business models",'Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)',Data Driven Smart Monitoring for Pipeline Integrity Assessment,10.2118/197327-MS,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

324084887,2017-08-01T00:00:00,"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a valuable and well-established inversion technique
for the estimation of geophysical parameters from satellite images. After training, ANNs are able to generate very fast products for several types of applications. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient way to detect and map strong earthquake damage for contributing to post-disaster activities during emergency phases. This work aims at presenting an application of the ANN inversion technique addressed to the evaluation of building collapse ratio (CR), defined as the number of collapsed buildings with respect to the total number of buildings in a city block, by employing optical and SAR satellite data. This is done in order to directly relate changes in images with damage that has occurred during strong earthquakes. Furthermore, once they have been trained, neural networks can be used rapidly at application stage. The goal was to obtain a general tool suitable for re-use in different scenarios. An ANN has been implemented in order to emulate a regression model and to estimate the CR as a continuous function. The adopted ANN has been trained using some features obtained from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, as inputs, and the corresponding values of collapse ratio obtained from the survey of the 2010 M7 Haiti Earthquake, i.e., as target output. As regards the optical data, we selected three change parameters: the Normalized Difference Index (NDI), the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD), and Mutual Information (MI). Concerning the SAR images, the Intensity Correlation Difference (ICD) and the KLD parameters have been considered. Exploiting an object-oriented approach, a segmentation of the study area into several regions has been performed. In particular, damage maps have been generated by considering a set of polygons (in which satellite parameters have been calculated) extracted from the open source Open Street Map (OSM) geo-database. The trained ANN has been proposed for the M6.0 Amatrice earthquake that occurred on 24 August 2016, in central Italy, by using the features extracted from Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images as input. The results show that the ANN is able to retrieve a building collapse ratio with good accuracy. In particular, the fusion approach modelled the collapse ratio characterized by high values of CR (more than 0.5) over the historical center that agrees with observed damages.

The complex and opportunistic environment in which edge computing systems operate, poses a fundamental challenge for online edge system orchestration, resource provisioning and real-time responsiveness in response to user movement. Such a challenge needs to addressed throughout the edge system lifecycle, starting from the software development methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel development process for modeling opportunistic edge computing services, which rely on (i) ETSI MEC reference architecture and Opportunistic Internet of Things Service modeling for the early stage of system analysis and design, i.e. domain model and service metamodel; and on (ii) feature engineering for evaluating those opportunistic aspects with data analysis. To address the identified opportunistic properties, at the service design phase we construct (both automatically and through domain expertise) Opportunistic Feature Vectors for Edge, containing the numerical representations of those properties. Such vectors enable further data analysis and machine learning techniques in the development of distributed, effective and efficient edge computing systems. Lastly, we exemplify the integrated process with a microservice-based user mobility management service, based on a real-world data set, for online analysis in MEC systems",'Elsevier BV',Service modeling for opportunistic edge computing systems with feature engineering,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
201478044,2017-11-01T00:00:00,"Monitoring of mechanical structures is a Big Data challenge and includes Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Non-destructive Testing (NDT). The sensor data produced by common measuring techniques, e.g., guided wave propagation analysis, is characterized by a high dimensionality in the temporal and spatial domain. There are off- and on-line methods applied at maintenance- or run-time, respectively. On-line methods (SHM) usually are constrained by low-resource processing platforms, sensor noise, unreliability, and real-time operation requiring advanced and efficient sensor data processing. Commonly, structural monitoring is a task that maps high-dimensional input data on low-dimensional output data (information, which is feature extraction), e.g., in the simplest case a Boolean output variable “Damaged”. Machine Learning (ML), e.g., supervised learning, can be used to derive such a mapping function. But ML quality and performance depends strongly on the input data size. Therefore, adaptive and reliable input data reduction (that is feature selection) is required at the first layer of an automatic structural monitoring system. Assuming some kind of two-dimensional sensor data (or n-dimensional data in general), image segmentation can be used to identify Regions of Interest (ROI), e.g., of wave propagation fields. Wave propagation in materials underlie reflections that must be distinguished, especially in hybrid materials (e.g., combining metal and fibre-plastic composites) there are complex wave propagation fields. The image segmentation is one of the most crucial parts of image processing. Major difficulties in image segmentation are noise and the differing homogeneity (fuzziness and signal gradients) of regions, complicating the definition of suitable threshold conditions for the edge detection or region splitting/clustering. Many traditional image segmentation algorithms are constrained by this issue. Artificial Intelligence can aid to overcome this limitation by using autonomous agents as an adaptive and self-organizing software architecture, presented in this work. Using a collection of co-operating agents decomposes a large and complex problem in smaller and simpler problems with a Divide-and-Conquer approach. Related to the image segmentation scenario, agents are working mostly autonomous (de-coupled) on dynamically bounded data from different regions of a signal or an image (i.e., distributed with simulated mobility), adapted to the locality, being reliable and less sensitive to noisy sensor data. In this work, self-organizing agents perform segmentation. They are evaluated with measured high-dimensional data from piezo-electric acusto-ultrasonic sensors recording the wave propagation in plate-like structures. Commonly, SHM deploys only a small set of sensors and actuators at static positions delivering only a few temporal resolved sensor signals (1D), whereas NDT methods additionally can use spatial scanning to create images of wave signals (2D). Both one-dimensional temporal and two-dimensional spatial segmentation are considered to find characteristic ROI",'MDPI AG',Robust and Adaptive Signal Segmentation for Structural Monitoring Using Autonomous Agents,10.3390/ecsa-4-04917,,"[{'title': 'Proceedings', 'identifiers': ['issn:2504-3900', '2504-3900']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
523343946,2019-11-05T00:00:00,"none35G mobile network technology promises to deliver unprecedented ultra-low latency and high data rates, paving the way for many novel applications and services. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) are two of the technologies that are expected to play a pivotal role in 5G to achieve ambitious Quality of Service requirements of such applications. While NFV provides flexibility by enabling network functions to be dynamically deployed and inter-connected to realize Service Function Chains (SFC), MEC brings the computing capability to the edges of the mobile network thus reducing latency and alleviating the transport network load. However, adequate mechanisms are needed to meet the dynamically changing network service demands, to optimally utilize the network resources while, at the same time, making sure that the end-to-end latency requirement of services is always satisfied.

In this work, we first propose machine learning models, in particular neural-networks, that can perform auto-scaling by predicting the required number of virtual network function instances based on the traffic demand, using the traffic traces collected over a real-operator commercial network. We then employ Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques to formulate and solve a joint user association and SFC placement problem, where each SFC represents a service requested by a user with end-to-end latency and data rate requirements. Finally, we propose a heuristic to address the scalability concern of the ILP model.noneSubramanya, Tejas, Davit Harutyunyan, Roberto RiggioSubramanya, Tejas; Harutyunyan, Davit; Riggio, Robert",'Elsevier BV',Machine learning-driven service function chain placement and scaling in MEC-enabled 5G networks,10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106980,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482096742,2021-09-01T00:00:00,"In recent times, health applications have been gaining rapid popularity in smart cities using the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Many real-time solutions are giving benefits to both patients and professionals for remote data accessibility and suitable actions. However, timely medical decisions and efficient management of big data using IoT-based resources are the burning research challenges. Additionally, the distributed nature of data processing in many proposed solutions explicitly increases the threats of information leakages and damages the network integrity. Such solutions impose overhead on medical sensors and decrease the stability of the real-time transmission systems. Therefore, this paper presents a machine-learning model with SDN-enabled security to predict the consumption of network resources and improve the delivery of sensors data. Additionally, it offers centralized-based software define network (SDN) architecture to overcome the network threats among deployed sensors with nominal management cost. Firstly, it offers an unsupervised machine learning technique and decreases the communication overheads for IoT networks. Secondly, it predicts the link status using dynamic metrics and refines its strategies using SDN architecture. In the end, a security algorithm is utilized by the SDN controller that efficiently manages the consumption of the IoT nodes and protects it from unidentified occurrences.

195779112,2018-01-01T00:00:00,"According to statistics, every fifth married couple is faced with the inability to conceive a child. Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample. At the final stage of study, the program's functioningwas tested on real data.За статистикою, кожна п'ята подружня пара стикається з неможливістю зачаття дитини.

323141626,2020-01-01T08:00:00,"2020 Elsevier Ltd Smart cities are conceptualized as a vehicle for sustainable urban development and a means to deliver high quality of life for residents. One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city\u27s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring",'Sociological Research Online',A sentiment reporting framework for major city events: Case study on the China-United States trade war,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park.

395143864,2020-09-23T00:00:00,"[EN] Freshwater quality is deteriorating worldwide. In populated areas, urban pollution is the main pressure on surface continental waters, but intensive wastewater treatment is costly. Setting standards for treatment of wastewater before discharge is a major policy instrument for water authorities, balancing environmental gains and operational costs. Discharge permits usually define concentration limits at the discharge point of the plant effluent. This approach, however, may not guarantee the good status of the receiving waters. Discharge permits should be directly linked to pollutant concentration in the river. Our paper develops an approach to adaptively adjust discharge permits and applies it to Madrid and the Manzanares river, a city of more than 3 million inhabitants discharging its treated wastewater to a stream having less than 2 m(3) s(-1) average flow. Stricter limits to 5-day biological oxygen demand (11 mg O-2 L-1), ammonium (0.5 mg N-NH4 L-1), nitrate (5.9 mg N-NO3 L-1), and phosphate (0.17 mg P-PO4 L-1) at plant effluent are required to meet the river environmental objectives. The results can be generalized to assess wastewater management decisions in other geographical areas.The authors wish to thank the Tagus River Basin Authority (Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo) for their availability and readiness to share information, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments.

323090695,2019-09-01T00:00:00,"[EN] An intelligent virtual environment simulates a physical world inhabited by autonomous intelligent entities. Multi-agent systems have been usually employed to design systems of this kind. One of the key aspects in the design of intelligent virtual environments is the use of appropriate ontologies which offer a richer and more expressive representation of knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes an ontology comprising concepts for modelling intelligent virtual environments enhanced with concepts for describing agent-based organisational features. This new ontology, called MAMbO5, is used as an input of the JaCalIVE framework, which is a toolkit for the design and implementation of agent-based intelligent virtual environments.This work was supported by the project TIN2015-65515-C4-1-R of the Spanish government.

489832333,2021-11-15T00:00:00,"Edge Cloud (EC) is poised to brace massive machine type communication (mMTC) for 5G and IoT by providing compute and network resources at the edge. Yet, the EC being regionally domestic with a smaller scale, faces the challenges of bandwidth and computational throughput. Resource management techniques are considered necessary to achieve efficient resource allocation objectives. Software Defined Network (SDN) enabled EC architecture is emerging as a potential solution that enables dynamic bandwidth allocation and task scheduling for latency sensitive and diverse mobile applications in the EC environment. This study proposes a novel Heuristic Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based flow-level dynamic bandwidth allocation framework and validates it through end-to-end implementation using OpenFlow meter feature. OpenFlow meter provides granular control and allows demand-based flow management to meet the diverse QoS requirements germane to IoT traffics. The proposed framework is then evaluated by emulating an EC scenario based on real NSF COSMOS testbed topology at The City College of New York. A specific heuristic reinforcement learning with linear-annealing technique and a pruning principle are proposed and compared with the baseline approach. Our proposed strategy performs consistently in both Mininet and hardware OpenFlow switches based environments. The performance evaluation considers key metrics associated with real-time applications: throughput, end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and overall system cost for bandwidth allocation. Furthermore, our proposed linear annealing method achieves faster convergence rate and better reward in terms of system cost, and the proposed pruning principle remarkably reduces control traffic in the network.8th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud 2021), 23-25 August, 2021, Virtual (Online",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Flow-Level Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in SDN-Enabled Edge Cloud using Heuristic Reinforcement Learning,10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00009,https://core.ac.uk/download/489832333.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a machine-learned model of foodborne illness detection in a real-world setting. To this end, we built FINDER, a machine-learned model for real-time detection of foodborne illness using anonymous and aggregated web search and location data. We computed the fraction of people who visited a particular restaurant and later searched for terms indicative of food poisoning to identify potentially unsafe restaurants. We used this information to focus restaurant inspections in two cities and demonstrated that FINDER improves the accuracy of health inspections; restaurants identified by FINDER are 3.1 times as likely to be deemed unsafe during the inspection as restaurants identified by existing methods. Additionally, FINDER enables us to ascertain previously intractable epidemiological information, for example, in 38% of cases the restaurant potentially causing food poisoning was not the last one visited, which may explain the lower precision of complaint-based inspections. We found that FINDER is able to reliably identify restaurants that have an active lapse in food safety, allowing for implementation of corrective actions that would prevent the potential spread of foodborne illness",'Springer Science and Business Media LLC',Machine-learned epidemiology: real-time detection of foodborne illness at scale,10.1038/s41746-018-0045-1,,"[{'title': 'npj Digital Medicine', 'identifiers': ['2398-6352', 'issn:2398-6352']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In the next decade, AI will become the main mar­ket trend and the best business tool. The contribution of intellectual technologies to global GDP is estimated at 15.7 trillion. dollars In the next 5-10 years, China will be the leader in the successful operation and adaptation of AI technologies. Ac­cording to analysts, the most benefit from AI technologies will be in the areas of fi­nancial services, retail and medicine.The scientific and inventive activity in the sphere of AI, the role of protection of in­tellectual property (patent and copyright), and the maintenance of the balance of com­peting interests are researched. Recently, the number of inventions based on AI has sharply increased. The leaders in the number of such inventions are American compa­nies IBM and Microsoft. This growth is due to the fact that in recent years AI has evolved from the theoretical concept into a real product that gains the world market. Since the advent of AI in the 50’s of the last century, inventors and researchers have applied for almost 340 thousand inventions based on AI (as of the end of 2016) and published more than 1.6 million scientific articles. The transport sector, including au­tonomous vehicles, is one of the sectors with the highest rates of growth in the appli­cation of AI.

A typical driver invests a considerable part of the total trip time looking for a free space where to park his vehicle; in many cases, this leads to delays and the consequent discomfort due to the undesired consequences of the generated tardiness. For this problem it is possible to find partial palliative solutions, minimizing the time spent searching for parking by applying Internet of Things techniques, oriented to smart cities and buildings. This research has been focused on finding an appropriate computer architecture that will allow the implementation of a distributed system, which, thanks to the use of computer vision and machine learning techniques, detects free parking spaces inside a parking lot, and provides real time information to the driver, allowing him to go as directly as possible to a vacant parking space",'Universidad Tecnologica Equinoccial',"Where to park?

Studies in the past focused mainly on the performance of road construction process. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of the fourth industrial revolution (4.0IR) on the road transport assets in developing countries such as Nigeria. The current study aimed at assessing the effect of the fourth industrial revolution towards improving the management practice of road transport assets. Survey instruments were administered to project and facility managers in the Nigerian road construction sector of the economy using a proportionate random sampling technique. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used for data analysis utilising the Warp 7.0 PLS-SEM software algorithm. The software calculates p-values with WarpPLS based on non-parametric algorithms, resampling or stable algorithms and thus does not require that the variables to be normally distributed. The study concluded that 4.0IR drivers have a moderate effect change on the management practice of road transport assets in Nigeria at the moment. The findings imply that management of road assets in Nigeria would moderately improve due to 4.0IR technologies resulting in transport, safety and general efficiency and effectiveness of road networks in Nigeria. The study identified 4.0IR drivers to include; robotics, mobility, virtual and augmented reality, internet of things and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 3D printing drones that are built with an attached 3D printer, (the drone hangs a 3D printing nozzle that's fed plastic, concrete mix or other material from a tube connected to the top of the drone's printing path that precisely plotted by software, for a promised printing accuracy of 0.1mm),and digital engineering.

201556333,2018-12-01T00:00:00,"Authentication systems based on biometrics characteristics and data represents one of the most important trend in the evolution of the society, e.g., Smart City, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data. In the near future, biometrics systems will be everywhere in the society, such as government, education, smart cities, banks etc. Due to its uniqueness, characteristic, biometrics systems will become more and more vulnerable, privacy being one of the most important challenges. The classic cryptographic primitives are not sufficient to assure a strong level of secureness for privacy. The current paper has several objectives. The main objective consists in creating a framework based on cryptographic modules which can be applied in systems with biometric authentication methods. The technologies used in creating the framework are: C#, Java, C++, Python, and Haskell. The wide range of technologies for developing the algorithms give the readers the possibility and not only, to choose the proper modules for their own research or business direction. The cryptographic modules contain algorithms based on machine learning and modern cryptographic algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption System), SHA-256, RC4, RC5, RC6, MARS, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, THREEFISH, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), Elliptic Curve, and Diffie Hellman. As methods for implementing with success the cryptographic modules, we will propose a methodology which can be used as a how-to guide. The article will focus only on the first category, machine learning, and data clustering, algorithms with applicability in the cloud computing environment. For tests we have used a virtual machine (Virtual Box) with Apache Hadoop and a Biometric Analysis Tool. The weakness of the algorithms and methods implemented within the framework will be evaluated and presented in order for the reader to acknowledge the latest status of the security analysis and the vulnerabilities founded in the mentioned algorithms. Another important result of the authors consists in creating a scheme for biometric enrollment (in Results). The purpose of the scheme is to give a big overview on how to use it, step by step, in real life, and how to use the algorithms.

Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging.

Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier.

The fuzzy inference engine used in the algorithm is based in the principle of maximum entropy. The approach considers passengers’ preferences to assign a level of congestion in each car of the train in function of the properties of the station platforms. This approach is implemented to estimate the passenger flow and dwelling times of the recently opened Line 1 of the Panama Metro. The dwelling times obtained from the simulation are compared to real measurements to validate the approach.The authors of this paper want to express their gratitude to the National Secretary of Science and Technology (SENACYT) of the Government of the Republic of Panama for funding this study through the R & D project (MDEPRB09-001).

This brings cutting-edge computing paradigms with embedded cognitive capabilities into vehicle domains and data infrastructure to provide holistic intrinsic and extrinsic intelligence for new mobility applications. Digital technologies are a significant enabler in achieving the sustainability goals of the green transformation of the mobility and transportation sectors. Innovation occurs predominantly in ECAS vehicles’ architecture, operations, intelligent functions, and automotive digital infrastructure. The traditional ownership model is moving toward multimodal and shared mobility services. The ECAS vehicle’s technology allows for the development of virtual automotive functions that run on shared hardware platforms with data unlocking value, and for introducing new, shared computing-based automotive features. Facilitating vehicle automation, vehicle electrification, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is accomplished by the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), cellular/wireless connectivity, edge computing, the Internet of things (IoT), the Internet of intelligent things (IoIT), digital twins (DTs), virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Vehicles become more intelligent, connected, functioning as edge micro servers on wheels, powered by sensors/actuators, hardware (HW), software (SW) and smart virtual functions that are integrated into the digital infrastructure. Electrification, automation, connectivity, digitalization, decarbonization, decentralization, and standardization are the main drivers that unlock intelligent vehicles' potential for sustainable green mobility applications. ECAS vehicles act as autonomous agents using swarm intelligence to communicate and exchange information, either directly or indirectly, with each other and the infrastructure, accessing independent services such as energy, high-definition maps, routes, infrastructure information, traffic lights, tolls, parking (micropayments), and finding emergent/intelligent solutions. The article gives an overview of the advances in AI technologies and applications to realize intelligent functions and optimize vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future ECAS vehicles to support the acceleration of deployment in various mobility scenarios. ECAS vehicles, systems, sub-systems, and components are subjected to stringent regulatory frameworks, which set rigorous requirements for autonomous vehicles. An in-depth assessment of existing standards, regulations, and laws, including a thorough gap analysis, is required. Global guidelines must be provided on how to fulfill the requirements. ECAS vehicle technology trustworthiness, including AI-based HW/SW and algorithms, is necessary for developing ECAS systems across the entire automotive ecosystem. The safety and transparency of AI-based technology and the explainability of the purpose, use, benefits, and limitations of AI systems are critical for fulfilling trustworthiness requirements.

Technique. Selective particle swarm optimization as a simple modification of the binary particle swarm optimization to search in a selected decision space was used for solving the aforesaid problem formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer combinatorial nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a plenty of test systems and real schemes with the different number of buses were used and selective particle swarm optimization was compared to another modern heuristic and artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony search algorithm, fuzzy-reasoning approach, etc.). MATLAB R2010a was applied as a computational tool to realize the proposed algorithm for modeling of the real large-scale distribution system. Before starting simulation, the long-term measurements (during one week) of the active and reactive power, power factor, voltage distortion and unbalance were made by Fluke 435 power quality analyzer on the four feeders with the highest active power losses and voltage drop. Results. Simulation results before and after optimization demonstrated an effectiveness of the selective particle swarm optimization in reducing the both active power and energy losses, improving the voltage quality and receiving the total annual saving. A comparative study of the three abovementioned techniques (capacitor placement, reconfiguration and reconductoring) to optimize a performance of the large-scale distribution system was executed. Scientific novelty. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for an optimization procedure of the real large-scale distribution system to find the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously accounting for technical constraints (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits, maximum total harmonic distortion limit and maximum permissible total size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure).

Перед початком моделювання за допомогою аналізатору якості електроенергії Fluke 435 на чотирьох фідерах з найбільшими втратами активної потужності та спадом напруги були виконані тривалі (протягом одного тижня) вимірювання активної та реактивної потужності, коефіцієнту потужності, несинусоїдності та несиметрії напруг.

Among them, the definition of an efficient link-quality estimation (LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both the quality of the selected network routes and nodesâ\u80\u99 energy consumption. In this paper, we present RL-Probe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in RPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy waste. To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility.

185549869,2018,"The characterization of the melting layer (ML) is an important task for operational radar meteorology. Melting layer identification may be used to establish distances at which radar rainfall estimates become affected by melting hydrometeors, with benefits for operational hydrometeor classification, as snowfall, freezing rain and liquid precipitation. Consequently, this yields a significant performance improvement in radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) on ground. Furthermore, knowledge of the ML location is also important for microphysical cloud characterization and the evaluation of icing potential. Several studies and algorithms exist in literature for characterizing ML through radar measurement signature, the most popular being the increase in the radar reflectivity factor known as bright. For dual polarization radar, ML detection can be pursued using specific signatures of dual polarization measurements, such as differential reflectivity ZDR, co-polar correlation coefficient \rhoHV , specific differential phase KDP, and linear depolarization ratio LDR that exhibit well-pronounced ML signatures both in stratiform and even in convective situations. Moreover, ML and rainfall have a strong influence on satellite links signals, as they are attenuated due to the presence of hydrometeors along the propagation path. In stratiform precipitation systems, the ML is the upper limit of the rainfall column height that is responsible of the attenuation of radio signals. Therefore, ML climatology is proficiently used for designing satellites links relative to a specific area. Very recently, a new X-band Doppler, dual-polarization weather radar system has been installed in Florence funded by the Tuscany Region Government within the NEFOCAST project. The latter investigates a new concept system that aims at providing real time precipitation maps trough the attenuation measurements collected by a dense population of new-generation interactive satellite terminals (called SmartLNB, Smart Low-Noise Block converter). A number of SmartLNB has been deployed in the Tuscany region and a test bed has been established in cooperation with the schools of the Florence Metropolitan city. In the present study, the potential of the new weather radar system is investigated for characterizing the ML in terms of height and thickness under different meteorological conditions and cloud systems. Measurements collected in the RangeHeight Indicator (RHI) scan mode along the direction to the Eutelsat 10A satellite (used for the experimental campaign of the NEFOCAST project) have been analysed with the simultaneous attenuation estimation obtained by the SmartLNBs with radar coverage during selected precipitative events. Statistical analyses have been performed based on both weather radar and SmartLNB measurements, supplemented by ancillary observations from some rain gauges (both impact and tipping-bucket types) co-located with SmartLNBs. In addition, a C-band radar system (Polar 55C) located in Rome has also been used for this work. Polar 55C dual polarization measurements have been analysed with respect to co-located SmartLNBs and laser disdrometer. The results of this analysis highlight the effects of ML on radio signal attenuation, as the total attenuation of signal increases also with the increase of ML vertical thickness. Therefore, the characterization of the vertical profile of precipitation is mandatory for implementing accurate QPE on ground, both from radars and satellite links",'Wageningen University and Research',Studies of the melting layer of precipitative systems using X-band dual polarization weather radar and SmartLNB network,10.18174/454537,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The key role of computer scientists is providing energy researchers and practitioners with cutting-edge and scalable analytics engines to effectively support their daily research activities, hence fostering and leveraging data-driven approaches.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed engine to predict building-specific power consumption.

SPEC addresses the full analytic stack and exploits a data stream approach over sliding time windows to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The model allows us to predict the upcoming power consumption at a time instant in the near future. 

SPEC integrates different machine learning approaches, specifically 

ridge regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest regression, to predict fine-grained values of power consumption, and  

a classification model, the random forest classifier, to forecast a coarse consumption level. 

SPEC exploits state-of-the-art distributed computing frameworks to address the big data challenges in harvesting energy data: the current implementation runs on Apache Spark, the most widespread high-performance data-processing platform, and can natively scale to huge datasets.

We fine tune the GA for crossover, mutation, fitness calculation and obtain the optimal parameters. Secondly, we train several regression models to predict the total travel time in the studied traffic network, and select the best performing model which we further hyper-tune. Lastly, we propose a new algorithm BGA-ML combining the GA algorithm and the extreme-gradient decision-tree (XGBT), which is the best performing regression model, together in a single optimization framework.

Classification algorithms are generally binary, but they must be extended to multi-class problems for real-world application. Multi-class classification is more complex than binary classification. In binary classification, only the decision boundaries of one class are to be known, whereas in multiclass classification, several boundaries are involved. The objective of this investigation is to propose a metaheuristic, optimized, multi-level classification learning system for forecasting in civil and construction engineering. The proposed system integrates the firefly algorithm (FA), metaheuristic intelligence, decomposition approaches, the one-against-one (OAO) method, and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The enhanced FA automatically fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the LSSVM to construct an optimized LSSVM classification model. Ten benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the enhanced optimization algorithm. Two binary-class datasets related to geotechnical engineering, concerning seismic bumps and soil liquefaction, are then used to clarify the application of the proposed system to binary problems.

Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.

Además, la gestión de los datos en un Sistema de Información Geográfica (SIG) dedicado, ha permitido un análisis profundo que facilita la comprensión de la evolución del repertorio iconográfico que, a lo largo de los siglos, ha sufrido varias desfiguraciones debido a la era iconoclasta. El conocimiento del mosaico también ha sido vital en la implementación de aplicaciones multimedia y en la creación de experiencias virtuales, en las que la información se puede transmitir y visualizar directamente en la reconstrucción virtual de todo el sitio arqueológico. La innovación del trabajo propuesto está, por lo tanto, en la gestión del flujo de datos que puede ser  explotado por diferentes actores a través de diferentes plataformas: expertos, gracias al uso del SIG, y visitantes con el uso de las aplicaciones multimedia (como son la Realidad Aumentada (AR) o la visualización web de alta resolución) para fines de divulgación, con el fin de preservar este patrimonio incalculable de la humanidad.Malinverni, ES.; Pierdiccaa, R.; Di Stefano, F.; Gabrielli, R.; Albiero, A.

As in other fields of architecture, the latest graphic techniques and manipulation of the image, allow a working methodology other than the current one in the patrimonial field. The information systems have been evolving towards technologies developed with open source software, the use of standards, ontologies and the structuring of information and of the 3D model itself under a semantic hierarchy. Interoperability between databases is favored and the maintenance of applications is ensured. The purpose is to support decision-making related to the model and simultaneously, serve multiple purposes such as cataloging, protection, restoration, conservation, maintenance or dissemination, among others. The research carried out for the realization of the survey of the City Council and Lonja of Alcañiz (Teruel), has the aim of expanding the historical knowledge of the buildings and delimiting its possible constructive phases, in order to obtain the geometric reality of the buildings.

295597015,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"This work aims to show the new approaches in embedded vision dedicated to object detection and tracking for drone visual control. Object/Pedestrian detection has been carried out through two methods: 1. Classical image processing approach through
improved Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Deformable Part Model (DPM) based detection and pattern recognition methods. In this step, we present our improved HOG/DPM approach allowing the detection of a target object in real time. The developed
approach allows us not only to detect the object (pedestrian) but also to estimates the distance between the target and the drone. 2. Object/Pedestrian detection-based Deep Learning approach. The target position estimation has been carried out within image
analysis. After this, the system sends instruction to the drone engine in order to correct its position and to track target. For this visual servoing, we have applied our improved HOG approach and implemented two kinds of PID controllers. The platform has been
validated under different scenarios by comparing measured data to ground truth data given by the drone GPS.

196141017,2018,"According to statistics, every fifth married couple is faced with the inability to conceive a child. Male germ cells are very vulnerable, and the growing number of cases of male infertility confirms that in today's world there are many factors that affect the activity of spermatozoa and their number. But the important thing is not so much their quantity, but quality. The spermogram is an objective method of laboratory diagnosis, which allows to accurately assess the man’s ability to fertilize by analyzing ejaculate for a number of key parameters. Only a spermogram can answer the question of a possible male infertility and the presence of urological diseases. When constructing spermograms, it is important to determine not only the number of good spermatozoa, but also their morphology and mobility. Therefore, research and improvement of some stages of spermogramm is the purpose of the study. This article addresses the problem of classification of spermatozoa in good and bad ones, taking into account their mobility and morphology, using methods of machine learning. In order to implement the first stage of machine learning (with a teacher) in the graphic editor, educational specimens (training sample) were created. The training was implemented by three methods: the method of support vector machine, the logistic regression and the method of K - the nearest neighbors. As a result of testing, the method K - the nearest neighbors is chosen. At the testing stage, a sample of 15 different spermatozoa was used in different variations of rotation around their axis. The test sample did not contain specimens from the training sample and was formed taking into account the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, but did not copy them from the training sample. At the final stage of study, the program's functioningwas tested on real data.За статистикою, кожна п'ята подружня пара стикається з неможливістю зачаття дитини. Чоловічі статеві клітини дуже вразливі, зростаюче число випадків чоловічого безпліддя підтверджує, що в сучасному світі дуже багато чинників, які впливають і на активність сперматозоїдів і на їх кількість. Та важливою є не стільки їх кількість, скільки якість. Спермограма є об'єктивним методом лабораторної діагностики, що дозволяє максимально точно оцінити здатність до запліднення чоловіка, проаналізувавши еякулят за рядом найважливіших параметрів. Тільки спермограма здатна відповісти на питання про можливе чоловіче безпліддя та про наявність урологічних захворювань. При побудові спермограми, важливо визначати не тільки кількість добрих сперматозоїдів, але й їх морфологію та рухливість. Тому дослідження та вдосконалення деяких етапів спермограми і є метою дослідження. У даній статті вирішується задача класифікації сперматозоїдів на добрі та погані, з урахуванням їх рухливості та морфології, із застосуванням методів машинного навчання. Для реалізації першого етапу машинного навчання (з вчителем) у графічному редакторі були створені навчальні екземпляри (тренувальна вибірка). Навчання було реалізована трьома методами: методом опорних векторів, логістична регресія та метод К - найближчих сусідів. За результатами тестування обрано метод К - найближчих сусідів. На етапі тестування використовувалася вибірка з 15 різних сперматозоїдів в різних варіаціях обертання навколо своєї осі. Тестова вибірка не містила примірників з тренувальної вибірки і була сформована з урахуванням морфологічних особливостей сперматозоїдів, але не копіювала їх з тренувальної вибірки.

201201436,2019-03-01T00:00:00,"In the wireless sensor network infrastructure of smart cities, whether the network traffic is balanced will directly affect the service quality of the network. Because of the traditional WSN (wireless sensor network) architecture, load balancing technology is difficult to meet the requirements of adaptability and high flexibility. This paper proposes a load balancing mechanism based on SDWSN (software defined wireless sensor network). This mechanism utilizes the advantages of a centralized control SDN (software defined network) and flexible traffic scheduling. The OpenFlow protocol is used to monitor the running status and link load information of the network in real time. According to the bandwidth requirement of the data flow, the improved load balanced routing is obtained by an Elman neural network. The simulation results show that the improved SDSNLB (software-defined sensor network load balancing) routing algorithm has better performance than LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol in balancing node traffic and improving throughput",'MDPI AG',A Load Balancing Routing Mechanism Based on SDWSN in Smart City,10.3390/electronics8030273,,"[{'title': 'Electronics', 'identifiers': ['issn:2079-9292', '2079-9292']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
482691058,2021-11-11T00:00:00,"Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is a relatively new concept that involves the merging of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT). It has emerged from the realization that Internet of Things networks could be further enhanced if they were also provided with Artificial Intelligence, enhancing the extraction of data and network operation. Prior to AIoT, the Internet of Things would consist of networks of sensors embedded in a physical environment, that collected data and sent them to a remote server. Upon reaching the server, a data analysis would be carried out which normally involved the application of a series of Artificial Intelligence techniques by experts. However, as Internet of Things networks expand in smart cities, this workflow makes optimal operation unfeasible. This is because the data that is captured by IoT is increasing in size continually. Sending such amounts of data to a remote server becomes costly, time-consuming and resource inefficient. Moreover, dependence on a central server means that a server failure, which would be imminent if overloaded with data, would lead to a halt in the operation of the smart service for which the IoT network had been deployed. Thus, decentralizing the operation becomes a crucial element of AIoT. This is done through the Edge Computing paradigm which takes the processing of data to the edge of the network. Artificial Intelligence is found at the edge of the network so that the data may be processed, filtered and analyzed there.  It is even possible to equip the edge of the network with the ability to make decisions through the implementation of AI techniques such as Machine Learning. The speed of decision making at the edge of the network means that many social, environmental, industrial and administrative processes may be optimized, as crucial decisions may be taken faster. 

Deep Intelligence is a tool that employs disruptive Artificial Intelligence techniques for data analysis i.e., classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization. Its strength lies in its ability to extract data from virtually any source type. This is a very important feature given the heterogeneity of the data being produced in the world today. Another very important characteristic is its intuitiveness and ability to operate almost autonomously.  The user is guided through the process which means that anyone can use it without any knowledge of the technical, technological and mathematical aspects of the processes performed by the platform. This means that the Deepint.net platform integrates functionalities that would normally take years to implement in any sector individually and that would normally require a group of experts in data analysis and related technologies [1-322]. 

The Deep Intelligence platform can be used to easily operate Edge Computing architectures and IoT networks. The joint characteristics of a well-designed Edge Computing platform (that is, one which brings computing resources to the edge of the network) and of the advanced Deepint.net platform deployed in a cloud environment, mean that high speed, real-time response, effective troubleshooting and management, as well as precise forecasting can be achieved. 

Moreover, the low cost of the solution, in combination with the availability of low-cost sensors, devices, Edge Computing hardware, means that deployment becomes a possibility for developing countries, where such solutions are needed most",,AIoT for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,,https://core.ac.uk/download/482691058.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
479365133,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"The ability to estimate radio coverage accurately is fundamental for planning and optimizing any wireless network, notably when a new generation, as the 5th Generation (5G), is in an early deployment phase. The knowledge acquired from radio planning of previous generations must be revisited, particularly the used path loss and antennas models, as the 5G propagation is intrinsically distinct. This paper analyses a new beamforming antenna model and distinct path loss models - 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Millimetre-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for Fifth Generation Integrated Communications (mmMAGIC) - applying them to evaluate 5G coverage in 3-Dimensional (3D) synthetic and real scenarios, for outdoor and indoor environments. Further, real 5G Drive Tests (DTs) were used to evaluate the 3GPP path loss model accuracy in Urban Macro (UMa) scenarios. For the new antenna model, it is shown that the use of beamforming with multiple vertical beams is advantageous when the Base Station (BS) is placed below the surrounding buildings; in regular UMa surroundings, one vertical beam provides adequate indoor coverage and a maximized outdoor coverage after antenna tilt optimization. The 3GPP path loss model exhibited a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.05 dB for Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 14.48 dB for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), compared with real measurements. After calibration, the MAE for LoS and NLoS decreased to 5.45 dB and 7.51 dB, respectively. Moreover, the non-calibrated 3GPP path loss model led to overestimations of the 5G coverage and user throughput up to 25&#x0025; and 163&#x0025;, respectively, when compared to the calibrated model predictions. The use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms resulted in path loss MAEs within the range of 4.58 dB to 5.38 dB, for LoS, and within the range of 3.70 dB to 5.96 dB, for NLoS, with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm attaining the lowest error",'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)',Analysis and Optimization of 5G Coverage Predictions Using a Beamforming Antenna Model and Real Drive Test Measurements,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097633,,"[{'title': 'IEEE Access', 'identifiers': ['issn:2169-3536', '2169-3536']}]",core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Fraud detection also provides another layer of urban socio-economic correlation heatmapping and improves city energy distribution. This paper describes a novel algorithm of energy fraud detection, utilizing energy and energy consumption specialized knowledge poured into AI front-end. The proposed algorithm improves fraud detection’s accuracy and reduces the false positive rate, as well as reducing the preliminary required training dataset. The paper also introduces a holistic algorithm, specifying the major phenomena that disguises as energy fraud or affects it. Consequently, a mathematical foundation for energy fraud detection for the proposed algorithm is presented.

Autorenverzeichnis 476Digitisation has established itself as the change maker par excellence in business, science and society. Infrastructures, working methods and skills are at the forefront of many debates and increasingly determine the future viability of entire industries. We have obviously embraced the permanent change with increasing acceleration. But: Where is the journey really going? Do communities constitute themselves exclusively in the interplay of hybrid realities? Are large amounts of data a threat or an opportunity? Can we process them at all or do we need fundamentally different tools and methods – such as visual analytics, virtual reconstruction, virtual engineering, virtual assistants and cooperative VR? Until recently, IT innovations were something for digital experts*, but hybrid communities in virtual realities are now part of everyday life. But what do managers have to prepare for? Digitalisation means new opportunities for openness, transparency and participation. Will this also lead to a revival of human-centred management activities?

213007942,2011,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a saprophytic bacterium which is the causative agent of melioidosis, a common cause of fatal bacterial pneumonia and sepsis in the tropics. The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n =40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n =40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n =16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site. Access to this type of information will advise the development and implementation of public health measures to reduce the incidence of melioidosis. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology",American Society for Microbiology,Groundwater seeps facilitate exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei,10.1128/AEM.05048-11,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213007942.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
235261716,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,https://core.ac.uk/download/235261716.pdf,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
54611646,2015,"Obiettivi: l’integrazione tra servizi sanitari e servizi socio-assistenziali è uno dei temi più rilevanti per l’amministrazione comunale di Cagliari che sta realizzando alcuni interventi di recupero funzionale di immobili dismessi in quartieri con particolari problematiche socio-economiche per creare Strutture Sanitarie Integrate denominate “Centri di salute”, rivolte in particolare modo agli anziani, ma capaci di avere ricadute sull’intera struttura sociale di riferimento.

Metodi: gli strumenti utilizzati sono quelli della pianificazione strategica e degli investimenti territoriali integrati, secondo una logica di intervento sulla struttura fisica della città coerente con la struttura demografica dei residenti e quindi capace di rispondere ai bisogni reali degli abitanti. I quartieri scelti per la sperimentazione sono “zone di margine” caratterizzati da una condizione di segregazione sociale e spaziale. Il modello di gestione è quello della medicina di iniziativa con intervento proattivo basato sulla partecipazione e coinvolgimento delle persone.

Risultati: i primi risultati mettono in evidenza che l’intervento messo in atto si presta particolarmente al coinvolgimento della popolazione anziana emarginata, che per presenza di barriere sociali, economiche, culturali ed ambientali, sottoutilizza o non si rivolge ai servizi di cura. Inoltre, alle azioni specifiche su target predefinito (ultra 70enni) vengono affiancate attività di promozione sociale del valore della salute e della cultura della responsabilità all’auto-cura individuale e collettiva.Objectives: the integration of health and social services is one of the most important issues for the municipal amministration of Cagliari which is building, restoration of functional abandoned buildings in neighborhoods with particular socio-economic problems to create Integrated Medical Information referred to as “health centers”, aimed particularly so for the elderly, but capable of having repercussions on the entire social structure of reference.

Methods: the instruments used are the strategic planning and investment territorial integrated, according to a logic of intervention on the physical structure of the city in line with the demographic structure of the residents and therefore able to respond to the real needs of the inhabitants. The districts chosen for testing are “marginal areas” characterized by a state of social and spatial segregation. The management model is one of medicine’s initiative with proactive intervention based on parteciapzione and involvement of people.

Results: the first results show that the intervention implemented is particularly the involvement of the elderly marginalized, that the presence of barriers to social, economic, and environmental culturalie, does not use care services. In addition, specific actions on target default (over 70years) are flanked promotion of social avlore health and culture of responsibility to self-care individual and collective",,Strategie e progettualità per Cagliari Città per la salute = Planning and strategies and for Cagliari Healthy City,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
347692253,2016-11-14T00:00:00,"Nowadays, monitoring of people and events is a common matter in the street, in the industry or at home, and acoustic event detection is commonly used. This increases the knowledge of what is happening in the soundscape, and this information encourages any monitoring system to take decisions depending on the measured events. Our research in this field includes, on one hand, smart city applications, which aim is to develop a low cost sensor network for real time noise mapping in the cities, and on the other hand, ambient assisted living applications through audio event recognition at home. This requires acoustic signal processing for event recognition, which is a challenging problem applying feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods. Furthermore, when the techniques come closer to implementation, a complete study of the most suitable platform is needed, taking into account computational complexity of the algorithms and commercial platforms price. In this work, the comparative study of several platforms serving to implement this sensing application is detailed. An FPGA platform is chosen as the optimum proposal considering the application requirements and taking into account time restrictions of the signal processing algorithms. Furthermore, we describe the first approach to the real-time implementation of the feature extraction algorithm on the chosen platform",'MDPI AG',An FPGA Platform Proposal for Real-Time Acoustic Event Detection: Optimum Platform Implementation for Audio Recognition with Time Restrictions,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
87904165,2017-06-08T00:00:00,"International audienceSmartphone usage while driving is a dangerous activity directly linked to 17% of deadly accidents in France in 2015. While it can potentially impact every road user, professional drivers are perhaps the most affected collective as they spend a high amount of time in their vehicles on a daily basis, whether they deliver goods or transport people. Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using driver head rotation movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction can be used as a reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study. Preliminary results are encouraging and a prototype of the system is already being tested by professional drivers in a naturalistic context",HAL CCSD,Driver Head Movements While Using a Smartphone in a Naturalistic Context,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A key component for successful deployment of the system is data related to the personal driving behavior of individual motorists.

The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n = 40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n = 40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n = 16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml. Comparison of isolates using multilocus sequence typing demonstrated clinical matches and close associations between environmental isolates and isolates derived from clinical samples from patients in Townsville. This study demonstrated that waterborne B. pseudomallei from groundwater seeps around Castle Hill may facilitate exposure to B. pseudomallei and contribute to the clinical clustering at this site. Access to this type of information will advise the development and implementation of public health measures to reduce the incidence of melioidosis",'American Society for Microbiology',Groundwater seeps facilitate exposure to Burkholderia pseudomallei,10.1128/AEM.05048-11,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

74313351,2016-01-01T00:00:00,"The continuous expansion of urban areas worldwide is expected to highly increase residential water demand over the next few years, ultimately challenging the distribution and supply of drinking water. Several studies have recently demonstrated that actions focused only on the water supply side of the problem (e.g., augmenting existing water supply infrastructure) will likely fail to meet future demands, thus calling for the concurrent deployment of effective water demand management strategies (WDMS) to pursue water savings and conservation. However, to be effective WDMS do require a substantial understanding of water consumers' behaviors and consumption patterns at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Retrieving information on users' behaviors, as well as their explanatory and/or causal factors, is key to spot potential areas for targeting water saving efforts and to design user-tailored WDMS, such as education campaigns and personalized recommendations. In this work, we contribute a data-driven approach to identify household water users' consumption behavioural profiles and model their water use habits. State-of-the-art clustering methods are coupled with big data machine learning techniques with the aim of extracting dominant behaviors from a set of water consumption data collected at the household scale. This allows identifying heterogeneous groups of consumers from the studied sample and characterizing them with respect to several consumption features. Our approach is validated onto a real-world household water consumption dataset associated with a variety of demographic and psychographic user data and household attributes, collected in nine towns of the Pilbara and Kimberley Regions of Western Australia. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the influence of candidate determinants on residential water consumption profiles and in attaining sufficiently accurate predictions of users' consumption behaviors, ultimately providing valuable information to water utilities and managers",,Data-driven behavioural modelling of residential water consumption to inform water demand management strategies,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While it can potentially impact every road user, professional drivers are perhaps the most affected collective as they spend a high amount of time in their vehicles on a daily basis, whether they deliver goods or transport people. Detecting smartphone usage is interesting for many reasons, from legal controls to forensics investigation in accidents, without forgetting the possibility of alert the driver of the danger he is engaging in. In this study we evaluate the pertinence of using driver head rotation movements to automatically predict smartphone usage at the wheel. In order to fit the system to the particularities of professional drivers, a naturalistic driving study have been conducted. 15 operational vehicles from two private French transport companies were equipped with near-infrared cameras, embedded real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques. Common behavioural patterns have been revealed. Head rebounds are a constant (letting the driver switch gaze between the road and the device). Additionally, the duration a driver spends looking down from a reference neutral direction can be used as a reliable parameter to predict smartphone usage. On the other hand some divergences between van and bus drivers head movements have been noticed. A real-time smartphone usage detection system has been implemented from the results of this study.

160631705,2017-01-01T00:00:00,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore. Using the real time monitored information, it was shown that at each blasting step over 85% of the scoops can be labelled correctly using the proposed methods and with an accuracy of over 95%",TU Bergakademie Freiberg,Development of support vector machine learning algorithm for real time update of resource estimation and grade classification,,,,core,smart cities,'smart cities' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
324084887,2017-08-01T00:00:00,"Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a valuable and well-established inversion technique
for the estimation of geophysical parameters from satellite images. After training, ANNs are able to generate very fast products for several types of applications. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient way to detect and map strong earthquake damage for contributing to post-disaster activities during emergency phases. This work aims at presenting an application of the ANN inversion technique addressed to the evaluation of building collapse ratio (CR), defined as the number of collapsed buildings with respect to the total number of buildings in a city block, by employing optical and SAR satellite data. This is done in order to directly relate changes in images with damage that has occurred during strong earthquakes. Furthermore, once they have been trained, neural networks can be used rapidly at application stage. The goal was to obtain a general tool suitable for re-use in different scenarios. An ANN has been implemented in order to emulate a regression model and to estimate the CR as a continuous function. The adopted ANN has been trained using some features obtained from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, as inputs, and the corresponding values of collapse ratio obtained from the survey of the 2010 M7 Haiti Earthquake, i.e., as target output. As regards the optical data, we selected three change parameters: the Normalized Difference Index (NDI), the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD), and Mutual Information (MI). Concerning the SAR images, the Intensity Correlation Difference (ICD) and the KLD parameters have been considered. Exploiting an object-oriented approach, a segmentation of the study area into several regions has been performed. In particular, damage maps have been generated by considering a set of polygons (in which satellite parameters have been calculated) extracted from the open source Open Street Map (OSM) geo-database. The trained ANN has been proposed for the M6.0 Amatrice earthquake that occurred on 24 August 2016, in central Italy, by using the features extracted from Sentinel-2 and COSMO-SkyMed images as input. The results show that the ANN is able to retrieve a building collapse ratio with good accuracy. In particular, the fusion approach modelled the collapse ratio characterized by high values of CR (more than 0.5) over the historical center that agrees with observed damages. Since the technique is independent from different typologies of input data (i.e., for radiometric or spatial resolution characteristics), the study demonstrated the strength of the proposed approach for estimating damaged areas and its importance in near real time monitoring activities, owing to its fast application.Published7814T.

We introduce a system to support teleoperated navigation with real-time mapping consisting of a two-step scan matching method that re-considers data associations during the search. The algorithm processes data from laser range finder and gyroscope only, thereby it is independent from the robot platform. Furthermore, we introduce a user-guided procedure for improving the global consistency of maps generated by the scan matcher. Globally consistent maps are computed by a graph-based maximum likelihood method that is biased by localizing crucial parts of the scan matcher trajectory on a prior given geo-tiff image.

201478044,2017-11-01T00:00:00,"Monitoring of mechanical structures is a Big Data challenge and includes Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Non-destructive Testing (NDT). The sensor data produced by common measuring techniques, e.g., guided wave propagation analysis, is characterized by a high dimensionality in the temporal and spatial domain. There are off- and on-line methods applied at maintenance- or run-time, respectively. On-line methods (SHM) usually are constrained by low-resource processing platforms, sensor noise, unreliability, and real-time operation requiring advanced and efficient sensor data processing. Commonly, structural monitoring is a task that maps high-dimensional input data on low-dimensional output data (information, which is feature extraction), e.g., in the simplest case a Boolean output variable “Damaged”. Machine Learning (ML), e.g., supervised learning, can be used to derive such a mapping function. But ML quality and performance depends strongly on the input data size. Therefore, adaptive and reliable input data reduction (that is feature selection) is required at the first layer of an automatic structural monitoring system. Assuming some kind of two-dimensional sensor data (or n-dimensional data in general), image segmentation can be used to identify Regions of Interest (ROI), e.g., of wave propagation fields. Wave propagation in materials underlie reflections that must be distinguished, especially in hybrid materials (e.g., combining metal and fibre-plastic composites) there are complex wave propagation fields. The image segmentation is one of the most crucial parts of image processing. Major difficulties in image segmentation are noise and the differing homogeneity (fuzziness and signal gradients) of regions, complicating the definition of suitable threshold conditions for the edge detection or region splitting/clustering. Many traditional image segmentation algorithms are constrained by this issue. Artificial Intelligence can aid to overcome this limitation by using autonomous agents as an adaptive and self-organizing software architecture, presented in this work. Using a collection of co-operating agents decomposes a large and complex problem in smaller and simpler problems with a Divide-and-Conquer approach. Related to the image segmentation scenario, agents are working mostly autonomous (de-coupled) on dynamically bounded data from different regions of a signal or an image (i.e., distributed with simulated mobility), adapted to the locality, being reliable and less sensitive to noisy sensor data. In this work, self-organizing agents perform segmentation. They are evaluated with measured high-dimensional data from piezo-electric acusto-ultrasonic sensors recording the wave propagation in plate-like structures. Commonly, SHM deploys only a small set of sensors and actuators at static positions delivering only a few temporal resolved sensor signals (1D), whereas NDT methods additionally can use spatial scanning to create images of wave signals (2D).

Safety applications as well as inherent VANET characteristics make data dissemination an essential service and a challenging task. We are developing a decentralized efficient solution for broadcast data dissemination through two game-theoretical mechanisms. Besides, VANETs can also include autonomous vehicles (AVs). AVs might represent a revolutionary new paradigm that can be a reality in our cities in the next few years. AVs do not need a driver to work; instead, they should copy a proper human behavior to adapt the driving according to the current circumstances, such as speed limit, pedestrian crossing street or wheather conditions. We will develop an AV software module including artificial intelligence (AI) techniques so that AVs can interact with the dynamic scenario throughout time. Finally, we also will include electrical vehicles (EV) in the VANET, so that special services such as finding and reserving an EV charging station place will be welcome.

The purpose of this study was to develop a model that can effectively identify traffic conditions prone to crashes and support implementation of proactive traffic safety management. On the basis of crash data and the corresponding detector data collected on expressways of Shanghai, China, different combinations of dual-loop detector data and time segments before crashes were used to develop the optimal crash risk estimation model by SVM. The transferability of the SVM model was assessed by examining whether the model developed on one expressway was applicable to other similar ones. In addition, the prediction results and transferability of the SVM model were compared with those given by other frequently used classification algorithms, including logistic regression, Bayesian networks, naïve Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbor, and back propagation neural network.

327184530,,"Initially appearing as an abstract object frequently used in math and physics, tensors have been attracting increasing interest in a broad range of research fields, such as engineering and data science. However, a few studies have addressed their application in wireless scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the wide applications of tensor techniques with an emphasis on the tensor voting method, which serves as an artificial intelligence approach for automatic inference and perceptual grouping. To illustrate the efficiency of the tensor voting approach, we tackle the tracking problem of inferring human mobility traces, which can provide key location information of networking objects. The trace inferring problem is considered under the circumstance that the recorded location information exhibits missing data and noise. Based on the tensor voting theory, we propose a sparse tensor voting algorithm and an implementation scheme with computational efficiency. The model is constructed based on the geometric connections between the input signals and encodes the structure information in the tensor matrix. The missing location information and noise can be distinguished via tensor decomposition. Once the trace information has been completed, further analysis of the inferred trace can be performed based on feature extraction to differentiate different objects. Moreover, we propose several feature extraction methods to characterize the inferred trace, including the scale invariant feature obtained from the fractal analysis. The proposed methods for trace completion and pattern analysis are applied to real human mobility traces.

This paper presents the selective particle swarm optimization and results of it applying to solve a problem of the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously for a real distribution system with 3 substations, 37 feeders, 274 buses, 284 branches and 11 normally open switches located in the eastern part of Mariupol city. Technique. Selective particle swarm optimization as a simple modification of the binary particle swarm optimization to search in a selected decision space was used for solving the aforesaid problem formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer combinatorial nonlinear optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a plenty of test systems and real schemes with the different number of buses were used and selective particle swarm optimization was compared to another modern heuristic and artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony search algorithm, fuzzy-reasoning approach, etc.). MATLAB R2010a was applied as a computational tool to realize the proposed algorithm for modeling of the real large-scale distribution system. Before starting simulation, the long-term measurements (during one week) of the active and reactive power, power factor, voltage distortion and unbalance were made by Fluke 435 power quality analyzer on the four feeders with the highest active power losses and voltage drop. Results. Simulation results before and after optimization demonstrated an effectiveness of the selective particle swarm optimization in reducing the both active power and energy losses, improving the voltage quality and receiving the total annual saving. A comparative study of the three abovementioned techniques (capacitor placement, reconfiguration and reconductoring) to optimize a performance of the large-scale distribution system was executed. Scientific novelty. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for an optimization procedure of the real large-scale distribution system to find the optimal capacitor placement and sizing, configuration and conductor sizing simultaneously accounting for technical constraints (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits, maximum total harmonic distortion limit and maximum permissible total size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). Practical value. For investigated distribution system, applying of all three optimization techniques simultaneously with THD constraint would be reduce the active power losses from 7.4 % to 3.5 % and energy losses – from 5 % to 2.38 % (approximately twice). In this case, the total annual saving would be about $700000 and the total saving for remaining period – about $4.8 million.Цель.

Перед началом моделирования с помощью анализатора качества электроэнергии Fluke 435 на четырёх фидерах с наибольшими потерями активной мощности и падением напряжения были проведены длительные (в течение одной недели) измерения активной и реактивной мощности, коэффициента мощности, несинусоидальности и несимметрии напряжений.

Научная новизна. Предложенный алгоритм был реализован для оптимизации параметров реальной разветвлённой распределительной сети с целью совместного определения оптимальных мест установки и мощности батарей конденсаторов, конфигурации и сечений проводников, учитывая технические ограничения (максимально допустимый ток, максимально и минимально допустимые напряжения, максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению и максимально допустимое значение суммарной установленной мощности батарей конденсаторов) и эксплуатационные ограничения (отсутствие отключенных нагрузок и радиальная структура сети). Практическая значимость. Применение для исследуемой распределительной сети всех трёх методов оптимизации одновременно с учётом ограничения на максимальное значение суммарного коэффициента гармонических составляющих по напряжению позволило бы снизить потери активной мощности с 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а потери электроэнергии – с 5 % до 2,38 % (примерно в 2 раза).

Для підтвердження ефективності запропонованого алгоритму були використані численні тестові та реальні схеми з різною кількістю вузлів, а селективний метод рою частинок був порівняний з іншими сучасними евристичними методами та методами штучного інтелекту (наприклад, імітація відпалу, генетичні алгоритми, алгоритм колонії мурашів, нечітка логіка та ін.). Щоби реалізувати запропонований алгоритм для моделювання реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі, у якості обчислювального засобу було застосовано середовище MATLAB R2010a. Перед початком моделювання за допомогою аналізатору якості електроенергії Fluke 435 на чотирьох фідерах з найбільшими втратами активної потужності та спадом напруги були виконані тривалі (протягом одного тижня) вимірювання активної та реактивної потужності, коефіцієнту потужності, несинусоїдності та несиметрії напруг. Результати. Результати моделювання до та після оптимізації продемонстрували ефективність застосування селективного методу рою частинок для зниження втрат активної потужності та електроенергії, покращення якості напруги та отримання сумарної річної економії. Виконано порівняльне дослідження трьох зазначених вище методів оптимізації параметрів розгалуженої розподільної мережі (встановлення батарей конденсаторів, реконфігурація та заміна перерізів провідників). Наукова новизна. Запропонований алгоритм був реалізований для оптимізації параметрів реальної розгалуженої розподільної мережі з метою спільного знаходження оптимальних місць встановлення та потужності батарей конденсаторів, конфігурації та перерізів провідників, враховуючи технічні обмеження (максимально припустимий струм, максимально та мінімально припустимі напруги, максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою та максимально припустиме значення сумарної встановленої потужності батарей конденсаторів) та експлуатаційні обмеження (відсутність вимкнених навантажень та радіальна структура мережі). Практична значимість. Застосування для досліджуваної розподільної мережі всіх трьох методів оптимізації разом з урахуванням обмеження на максимальне значення сумарного коефіцієнту гармонічних складових за напругою дозволило би знизити втрати активної потужності з 7,4 % до 3,5 %, а втрати електроенергії – з 5 % до 2,38 % (приблизно у 2 рази). У цьому випадку сумарна щорічна економія склала би приблизно 700000 $, а сумарна економія за залишковий період – приблизно 4,8 млн. $",Dnipropetrovsk National University of Railway Transport named after Acad.

Among them, the definition of an efficient link-quality estimation (LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both the quality of the selected network routes and nodesâ\u80\u99 energy consumption. In this paper, we present RL-Probe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in RPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy waste. To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility. Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing operations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of simulations and real experiments.

154896622,2017-11-16T00:00:00,"With the development of intelligent transportation systems, the estimation of traffic flow in urban areas has attracted a great attention of researchers. The timely and accurate travel information of urban residents could assist users in planning their travel strategies and improve the operational efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Currently, the origin-destination (OD) flows of urban residents are formulated as an OD matrix, which is used to denote the travel patterns of urban residents. In this paper, a simple and effective model, called NMF-AR, is proposed for predicting the OD matrices through combining the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm and the Autoregressive (AR) model. The basic characteristics of travel flows are first revealed based on the NMF algorithm. Then, the nonlinear time series coefficient matrix, extracted from the NMF algorithm, is estimated based on the AR model. Finally, we predict OD matrices based on the estimated coefficient matrix and the basis matrix of NMF. Extensive experiments have been implemented, in collected real data about taxi GPS information in Beijing, for comparing our proposed algorithm with some known methods, such as different kinds of $K$-nearest neighbor algorithms, neural network algorithms and classification algorithms.

A number of measures have been applied in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities in roads, i.e., implementation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based on image processing. In this paper, a real time speed supervisor based on road sign recognition that can work both in urban and non-urban environments is presented. The system is able to recognize 135 road signs, belonging to the danger, yield, prohibition obligation and indication types, and sends warning messages to the driver upon the combination of two pieces of information: the current speed of the car and the road sign symbol. The core of this paper is the comparison between the two main methods which have been traditionally used for detection and recognition of road signs: template matching (TM) and neural networks (NN). The advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches will be shown and commented.

161678999,2017,"This paper presents the development and implementation of a theoretical mathematical-statistical framework for sequential updating of the grade control model, based on a support vector machine learning algorithm. Utilising the Zambujal orebody within the Neves-Corvo Cu deposit in Portugal, parameters that can be measured in real time, used in visualisation, modelled for resource estimation, and used for process control visualisation and optimisation are considered.
The methodology broadly comprises of three steps. Firstly, the provided dataset is used to develop a virtual asset model (VAM) representing the true 3D grade distribution in order to simulate the mining method. Then ore quality parameters are established simulating real time monitoring sensor installation at: (a) stope development and rock face monitoring (face imaging and drillholes); and (b) transport monitoring (muck pile, LHD/scooptram). Next, the acquired data was assimilated into the models as part of the sequential model update.
Two different mining methods and the monitoring information that can be acquired during the ore extraction are analysed: (a) drift and fill mining and (b) bench and fill mining, which are widely implemented at the Neves-Corvo mine. Selected study zones were chosen such as to contrast mining through the high/low grade zones with different degrees of heterogeneity, which demonstrate the performance of resource estimation and classification models developed in heterogeneous mining stopes.
The grade accuracy and error in the resource model, and high/low grade ore classification accuracy and error are evaluated as performance metrics for the proposed methods.
In drift and fill mining, drillhole and face sampling data collection was simulated in a real-time manner and fed into the support vector machine (SVM) regressor to update the resource estimation model in both a high grade and low grade drift scenarios. In each scenario, six drift and fill mining steps were simulated sequentially and the posterior resource models, after integrating real time mining data, have shown significant improvement of bias correction in both updating planned resources and reconciling extracted ore.
In bench and fill mining, grade classification based on random sampling data from muck pile was demonstrated, considering scoop by scoop derived monitoring data. Three different classifiers (mean, median, and Bayesian) were tested and shown very good performance. In the case study presented here, a sequence of 15 blasting steps was simulated with each step requiring 112 scooping operations to transport the blasted ore.

226063288,2015,"In lab-on-chip for food analysis, dealing with large samples with complex composition (i.e. the matrix) and target analytes potentially in very low concentrations is one of major issues that needs to be tackled. In order to increase the analytical accuracy of a method, it is often required to process the sample before quantification of the chemical specie under examination. In milk case, the presence of fat, proteins and many other components in a complex phase equilibrium poses particular challenges for analysis. Caseins, in particular, are known as blocking agent for surfaces, and therefore may interact with sensor surfaces. Many methods are available for microfluidic processing [1], but they are usually developed for small samples (often blood). Scaling up processing rate to deal with 1-100ml samples in minutes is not practical in most cases. In milk, casein is usually found in micelles the size of about 50-300nm [2], formed by hydrophobic caseins complexed by calcium ions and enclosed by partially hydrophilic k-casein. Since isoelectric point of casein is 4.6, at milk pH there is an intrinsic negative charge, which can be used to separate it from the sample. Other options include size and density separation in microfluidic structure as for instance acoustic separation.

In this paper, we present the development of a high-throughput electrophoretic separation system for milk proteins allowing the separation of casein at flow rates in the range of mls/min, by exploiting the intrinsic charge of casein at milk pH (i.e. 6.6). The device is intended as a step for sample preparation to increase the accuracy of detection of contaminants in milk samples. Design, estimated performances and implementation of the device for the experimental evaluation of the approach are reported. We preliminary focused on BSA, lactoglobulins and caseins as model molecules. An electrophoretic mobility of -1.39µm cm V-1 s-1 was measured for casein in conditions as close as possible to real sample (typical ionic strength of milk 0.08M, pH 6.6). The range of flow rate suitable for separation can be estimated by the velocity of electrophoretic drag and flow velocity. Modelling of device provided the evaluation of optimal working conditions and design (potential and flow rate); with a maximum applied potential of 1.4V, the expected fractionation of proteins between the two outlets is reported in Fig. 1, where 0.5 is equivalent to no separation.

The device was implemented with platinum electrodes lithographed on silica glass wafers with semi-transparent grid pattern for inspection. In order to increase the throughput, we designed a separation chamber with large cross section (Fig. 2), where electrodes are facing on top and bottom walls of a chamber with width 4mm and channel height 510µm. Electrodes are 28 mm long. Electric field applied drags charged particle toward the upper or lower walls depending on charge.

The incidence of melioidosis is clustered spatially and temporally and is heavily linked to rainfall and extreme weather events. Clinical case clustering has recently been reported in Townsville, Australia, and has implicated Castle Hill, a granite monolith in the city center, as a potential reservoir of infection. Topsoil and water from seasonal groundwater seeps were collected around the base of Castle Hill and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR targeting the type III secretion system genes for the presence of B. pseudomallei. The organism was identified in 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.5 to 80.4) of soil samples (n = 40) and 92.5% (95% CI, 83.9 to 100) of seasonal groundwater samples (n = 40). Further sampling of water collected from roads and gutters in nearby residential areas after an intense rainfall event found that 88.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 100) of samples (n = 16) contained viable B. pseudomallei at concentrations up to 113 CFU/ml.

The implementation of a CNN requires several parameter restrictions with respect to the universal concept. For instance, the number representation and the cloning template are often confined to respectively 8 bits and a neighborhood of 1. It has been shown that optimal (i.e. minimal level) CNN architectures as derived from a morphological specification of the desired operation lead to arbitrarily large templates. A subsequent transformation step can turn this into a sequence of smaller templates for a specified hardware platform. The existence of a generic platform that can already handle the universal CNN architecture for prototyping and verification eliminates this need for technology-driven performance degradation. The proposed packet switcher consists of a physical layer where the CNN nodal function is performed, a data-link layer where the nodal data are maintained, a network layer with the packet receiver and sender and the actual switch as element of the transport layer.
