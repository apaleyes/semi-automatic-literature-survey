The raw format of user-generated content lacks a legitimate language structure. It, therefore, acts as an obstacle for applying the Sentiment analysis task, which aims to predict the true emotion of a sentence by providing a score and its nature. This paper concentrates on obtaining a single sentiment score using a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory encoder–decoder model. This research uses the text normalization process to transform the sentences consisting of noise, appearing as incorrect grammar, abbreviations, freestyle, and typographical errors, into their canonical structure. The experimental outcomes confirm that the proposed hybrid model performs well in standardizing the raw E-commerce website review, enriched with hidden information and provided a single sentiment score influenced by all the review scores for the product.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10660-022-09582-4,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In view of that customers sometimes cannot describe their purchasing intention in queries, this paper aims to identify purchase intention from implicit queries by computing semantic similarity between Q &D and proposes a novel model based on Word2Vec algorithm, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM). Besides, an empirical analysis is conducted through the Keras framework and based on the factual retrieval data of the Home Depot, an E-commerce website selling building materials in America. The results show that the proposed model has achieved improving F1-score on test dataset compared with other existing models. The novel model combines Word2Vec and LSTM to extract text features and applies DSSM to further fetch high-dimension representations by maximizing semantic similarity between the user query and the description of the correct merchandise. Our proposed model can be used to remove or minimize subjective factors in extracting features, improves the performance of purchasing intention identification, and also improves the customer experience of online shopping.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10479-022-04834-w,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

While AI offers various benefits, it can also be subject to systematic errors, whereby people from certain groups (defined by gender, age, or other sensitive attributes) experience disparate outcomes. In many AI applications, disparate outcomes confront businesses and organizations with legal and reputational risks. To address these, technologies for so-called “AI fairness” have been developed, by which AI is adapted such that mathematical constraints for fairness are fulfilled. However, the financial costs of AI fairness are unclear. Therefore, the authors develop AI fairness for a real-world use case from e-commerce, where coupons are allocated according to clickstream sessions. In their setting, the authors find that AI fairness successfully manages to adhere to fairness requirements, while reducing the overall prediction performance only slightly. However, they find that AI fairness also results in an increase in financial cost. Thus, in this way the paper’s findings contribute to designing information systems on the basis of AI fairness.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-021-00716-w,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The recent advancements in the fields of e-commerce and business have necessitated providing personalized online recommendation to the users or customers by predicting human emotion. Though it is easy to predict human emotion by observing one’s facial expression, but achieving the same with computer algorithm is challenging. In this work, a novel approach has been proposed for online recommendation system using human facial expression-based emotion detection. The facial expression is taken in real time, and thus, the proposed framework provides an intelligent recommendation system on–the-fly without relying on historical ratings or purchase records. This new approach is to predict the human emotion based on the facial features and to develop ways for recommending products to customers based on such reaction during the purchasing of a product. Two approaches have been used in this work. First, with the help of five different facial expressions, emotion of the user is detected, and analysis is done. Secondly, video of user’s facial expression is captured through a webcam while purchasing a product online. To predict emotion in real time, the live video from a webcam is fed into a network which detects faces and predicts the emotions. This proposed system can detect the emotion with 75% accuracy and provide online recommendation in real time. The performance measurement of the proposed recommendation system is done by taking feedback from the customers. The purpose of this work is to create a virtual environment and to provide recommendations in real time using deep learning approach.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11334-022-00437-7,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In this paper, the research status of content-based image retrieval algorithms is analysed, and how to use image content information to recommend goods is studied. A hierarchical commodity classification and retrieval system are designed. A class decision layer is used to determine the category of commodity images and then precisely retrieve the corresponding category of commodity image features.

Machine learning methods could be used to extract implicit knowledge from the logs. Industries and businesses use the knowledge to better understand the consumer behavior, and opportunities and threats correspondingly. The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home. These issues have direct effect on consumer behaviour in online shopping. In this paper, a prediction model is proposed to anticipate the consumers behaviour using machine learning methods. Five individual classifiers, and their ensembles with Bagging and Boosting are examined on the dataset collected from an online shopping site. The results indicate the model constructed using decision tree ensembles with Bagging achieved the best prediction of consumer behavior with the accuracy of 95.3%.

This paper proposes a model that fuses CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and attention mechanism to encode image features, and selects the image features of commodities. A 5-layer CNN without a fully connected layer is constructed to initially extract image features, and then a set of attention mechanism strategies is designed. This strategy is used to select the image features that have the greatest impact when generating words at different times. Considering the characteristics of quantitative indicators of the pricing model, this paper transforms this evaluation process of consumers into price perception. Corresponding mathematical model is set up to improve and expand the original probability unit model. The consumer selection model is utilized to obtain a prediction of product market share, and a nonlinear constraint programming is established to determine the optimal price. The strategy takes into account the changed market shares of consumer characteristics and product quality evaluation results. In the two-layer hybrid channel supply chain model, retailers and manufacturers all use third-party platforms when they achieve maximum benefits; when price cross-elasticity coefficients and third-party platform usage fees are independent variables of influencing factors, retailers are dispersed on CNN to get the most profit under the pricing strategy. Similarly, when the unit product tax difference is the independent variable of the influencing factors, the manufacturer is also the most profitable under the CNN decentralized pricing strategy.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10660-020-09449-6,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The popularity and influence of online reviews attract spammers who intend to elevate their products or services by writing positive reviews for them and lowering the business of others by writing negative reviews.

The classification approach requires a labelled dataset to train a model for the environment it is working on. The unavailability of the labelled dataset is a major limitation in the classification approach. To overcome the problem of the labelled dataset, we propose an unsupervised learning model combining long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and autoencoder (LSTM-autoencoder) to distinguish spam reviews from other real reviews. The said model is trained to learn the patterns of real review from the review’s textual details without any label.

Thus, false reviews can hamper sales of a product because a potential buyer would not buy it upon seeing negative reviews. Detection of these spam or fake reviews are necessary for the good of the users. A number of methods were used in the past for spam review detection; some used methods like manual labelling of a small dataset and then using it as base to check authenticity of other reviews, but this is not considered a viable option considering the amount of manual work required. This problem occurs due to the scarcity of clearly labelled datasets for spam/not spam reviews. The problem seems synonymous to the problem of detecting fake news on social media sites but it is not because there is no ground truth for fact checking. A very important fact about spam reviews is that they bear similarity and are full of adjectives because a spammer writes reviews mainly with the intent of either defaming a product or rating it higher than the actuality. Review rating and verified purchase are features that play a vital impact in detection of the fakeness of a review. So here we try to categorize customer reviews into fake and not fake on the basis of review-centric feature so that a reviewer may know whether a review they are reading is a potential spam. Various review-centric features include the rating of the review, product with which the review is related and the authenticity of the review.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-16-2641-8_47,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

This paper mainly studies the image retrieval task of goods in e-commerce websites. The main purpose of applying image retrieval in shopping websites is to enable users to search for the expected goods more conveniently and accurately in the massive commodity information. Given the traditional image retrieval process, only the image or text of goods is used as the retrieval object. The query results obtained do not take advantage of the information relevance and complementarity between text and images, which loses the retrieval advantages of goods. To solve the problem, this paper first designs an end-to-end supervised learning algorithm to project heterogeneous data into a common metric space and apply traditional indexing schemes in this space to achieve efficient image retrieval. Secondly, a fusion method is proposed to give better data and higher weight according to the semantic capture quality of input features.

The fast fashion online-only companies rely on e-commerce platforms to merchandize products and provide services to customers. Online-only companies use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) through recommendation systems and chatbots to improve business functions and enhance online customer shopping experience. Fast fashion multichannel companies (online and physical stores) have a concern about their physical stores’ performance, and the role that physical stores can play to enhance customer experience. Multichannel companies are continuously looking for new ways to optimize services and enhance customer experience in both channels. Physical stores can play a crucial role in enhancing customer experience. By collecting data on in-store customers, their interests and interactions with products, multichannel companies can analyze such data using AI and ML to optimize production, marketing, and customers experience. This paper highlights the application of AI in ecommerce by fast fashion companies.

As most of the customers value customer experience and claim that customer experience is the most important parameter when it comes to their decision making, in this work we focus on exploring those claims using “Black Friday” dataset. The aim of this study is to perform customer segmentation and suggest a strategy based on customers’ analysis and division, and to propose an optimal model for predicting customers’ behavior. Data mining and machine learning techniques were used to perform analysis, clustering, and model building. At first, data cleaning and preprocessing was done, followed by an extensive analysis of data. Then, K-means clustering algorithm was used to perform segmentation. Finally, three different models were built with a goal of predicting customers’ purchase behavior (in this case purchase value). After comparing the results of the models, it was concluded that Random Forest Regressor performed the best. In this paper we discuss results that we got, compare them to the previous studies and draw conclusions that might be useful for marketers and decision makers, as they can be the base for their new strategies.

To achieve it, companies use invoices where each seller generates an invoice for each transaction. As tons of invoices are generated by different sellers in different formats, it becomes difficult for the E-commerce industries to track trade and transactions manually. With exponential increment in the invoices, E-commerce industries need a solution to replace the manual intervention and adapt a completely automated data extraction system. Invoice data extraction systems are widely used in the E-commerce industries to remove the need of middleman for manual data extraction and automate the information retrieval process. Conventionally, an optical character recognition is used to salvage data from the invoice document, followed by a regress text analysis, which is an expensive and impractical solution. With the advancement in this field, pattern matching became a popular methodology, but the absence of specified patterns restricted the accuracy. Usage of recurrent neural network and graph neural network tackles most of these issues conveniently. This paper aims to give a glance of the researches in this domain and categorize the literature survey based on the adapted methodology, dataset involved, year of publication, and precision in data extraction.

In turn, this minimizes prediction errors and enables better-personalized suggestions of computer system configuration. We took advantage of the implicit feedback approach while modeling customer behaviors if they liked or disliked a particular product. After customer behavior data is collected, we form the customer-product matrix and generate personalized product suggestions for each customer with the help of user-item-based collaborating filtering and item-item-based collaborating filtering algorithms.

If the reviews available on the platform are spam, it will have an immense effect on the business of sellers and also the customers are made to believe something, which is not true. Hence this issue needs to be addressed as both customers and service providers are concerned regarding spam review recognition. Identifying a spam review is a challenging task since the fake reviewer also follows a similar pattern as a genuine user. Earlier studies have concentrated on sentiment approach to determine spam reviews and have ignored the personal qualities of the reviewer. In this perspective, the proposed project presents two different methods: Deceptive review detection using the linguistic method, which works based on the content of the review, lexical diversity and feature selection; Deceptive review detection using spammer behaviour, where different behavioural features are available based on which the percentage of deceptiveness and spam users will be calculated. Using the dataset obtained from a bigger platform, where social interaction is high like Yelp or Amazon can lead to better accuracy with a wide range of opinions and behavioural patterns.

With the evolution of the online markets, the trend towards fake reviews has increased, mainly to attract or distract customers. Fake reviews have affected both customers and sellers. These reviews consist of writings and spreading misleading information and beliefs. Sentiment analysis was first introduced a few years ago in the e-commerce sector. It is an emerging research area today due to the rapid growth in the e-commerce industry. The biggest challenge in detecting fake reviews is the lack of an effective way to distinguish fake reviews from legitimate reviews. The difference cannot be seen with the naked eye and is, therefore, a severe concern. In this paper, we have applied the bag of words model and glove embedding matrix with a focus on fake reviews. We have used two different feature extraction techniques and three new deep-learning algorithms on text classifications. The experimental analysis with an existing public dataset showed good and better results compared to the traditional machine-learning models.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s42979-021-00918-9,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

To solve this problem, this paper designs a new route planning method for cross-border e-commerce logistics of agricultural products based on recurrent neural network. Firstly, by calculating the speed of logistics vehicles under different traffic flow conditions, on the basis of analyzing the travel time of cross-border e-commerce logistics route of agricultural products, combining with the ratio of the carrying capacity to the maximum carrying capacity of cross-border e-commerce logistics routes of agricultural products, the driving speed of logistics vehicles is derived. In order to select the optimal distribution path, the total fixed cost, transportation damage cost and cargo damage cost in the process of agricultural product distribution are calculated. Combined with the penalty cost, the recursive neural network is used to establish the logistics route planning model and planning process of agricultural products’ cross-border e-commerce.

In particular, deriving standardized and structured descriptions from unstructured data modalities, such as texts and images, is crucial to the performance of search engines and the general organization of virtual store databases. In this paper, we propose methodologies and strategies based on Deep Learning classifiers to structure, update, and inspect large e-commerce catalogs. To this purpose, we exploit multimodal representations combining data from images and unstructured textual descriptions to identify relevant labels for e-commerce applications. Such modalities of data are employed to train deep neural network architectures, which are then able to automatically recognize attributes. Three classes of architecture were investigated: variations of the VGG architecture for recognition from images; architectures combining embedding, convolutional and recurrent layers for text recognition; and hybrid architectures that combine elements from each of the previous architectures. We also propose tools that allow the detection of insufficiently descriptive visual and textual data, which can be later manually improved; and automatic enhancement of attribute annotations through neural network predictions. Using a database that we collected through a Web Crawler from a large e-commerce site, we show in our experiments that hybrid architectures achieve a better result in the classification task by combining both types of data. Finally, we show results of a case study performed to demonstrate the potential of our strategy for insufficiently descriptive data detection.

RS has garnered the attention of the business community and individuals towards itself owing to its significance in the e-commerce field. One of the most common methods of the RS used for the generation of recommendations is the CF technique (collaborative filtering). But, CF-based RS yields untrustworthy similarity information and yields a recommendation quality that is not satisfactory. Support vector machine (SVM) helps in enhancing issues in the CF technique. The parameter of the SVM algorithm minimizes the system's accuracy, and therefore in classifier improved ant colony optimization (IACO) is brought-in for parameter optimization. In the newly introduced system, RS will be carried out in two stages which include (1) SVM classifier for classifying the entities into positive and negative feedback. The best value achieved indicates the optimized values of the parameters of SVM employing the IACO algorithm, which are given in the form of an input to the classifier to carry out pair-wise classification, (2) then, we construct SVM–IACO based collaborative filtering algorithm. The collaborative filtering recommendation's execution is only done on the entities' positive-feedback. The actual content used for recommendation is highly reduced owing to the classification much earlier; therefore the collaborative filtering improves the efficiency in comparison with the classical one.

Indeed, it benefits users in buying decisions and businesses to enhance their quality. However, various greedy organizations employ spammers to post biased spam reviews to gain an advantage or to degrade the reputation of a competitor. This results in the explosive growth of opinion spamming. Due to its nature and their increasing volume, spam reviews are a fast-growing serious issue on the internet. Until now, researchers have developed many Machine Learning (ML) based methods to identify opinion spam reviews. However, the traditional ML methods cannot effectively detect spam messages due to the limited feature representations and the data manipulations done by spammers to escape from the detection mechanism. As an alternative to ML-based detection, in this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning (DL) based novel framework called Self Attention-based CNN Bi-LSTM (ACB) model to learn document level representation for identifying the spam reviews. Our approach computes the weightage of each word present in the sentence and identifies the spamming clues exists in the document with an attention mechanism. Then the model learns sentence representation by using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and extracts the higher-level n-gram features. Then finally, sentence vectors are combined using Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) as document feature vectors and identify the spam reviews with contextual information.

E-commerce transaction volume is an evaluation index used to determine the development level of e-commerce. This study proposed a model for forecasting e-commerce transaction volume. First, a hybrid moth–flame optimization algorithm (HMFO) was proposed. The convergence ability of the HMFO algorithm was analyzed on the basis of test functions. Second, using data provided by the China Internet Network Information Center, factors influencing e-commerce transaction volume were analyzed. The input variables of the e-commerce transaction volume prediction model were selected by analyzing correlation coefficients. Finally, a hybrid extreme learning machine and hybrid-strategy-based HMFO (ELM-HMFO) method was proposed to predict the volume of e-commerce transactions. The prediction results revealed that the root mean square error of the proposed ELM-HMFO model was smaller than 0.5, and the determination coefficient was 0.99, which indicated that the forecast e-commerce transaction volume was satisfactory.

According to the model recognition, the characteristics of normal consumers' comments are analyzed. A DBN (Deep Belief Network) model that uses deep learning methods to identify false reviews is constructed. The model uses LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to mine deep semantic features, and uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to process the traditional discrete features extracted in this paper, which is multi-dimensional. We connect semantic features with traditional features to establish a DBN model.

Based on the posted reviews and ratings, customers decide the product’s reliability and make their purchase decisions. Usually, reviews and ratings come together. In a review, the user writes all the pros and cons of the product, whereas the rating is a cumulative representation of the review text given on a scale of 1–5. If any review is positive, its associated ratings are 4 and 5, and if the review is negative, it comes with ratings 1 and 2. Sometimes, the rating does not represent the review text correctly, for example, a negative review gives a rating 4 or 5, or positive review gives a rating 1 or 2. This creates an inconsistency between reviews and ratings. This paper develops a machine learning-based model for identifying such inconsistency and prompting users for their posts.

In addition to the product price, they also concern the word-of-mouth. However, marketing strategies from various e-commerce platforms, along with the diverse online commodities, make it difficult for customers to distinguish the most cost-effective products. Present cross-platform commodity comparison applications merely focus on product prices, without jointly concerning the reviews. In this demonstration, we developed a web-based application, CoSurvey , which matches commodities from various e-commerce platforms and analyzes product comment sentiment on the base of the proposed Attention-BiLSTM-CNN Model. The model uses an attention-based Bi-LSTM network to learn sentence sequence information, uses a CNN to learn sentence structure information, and uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn meta-information. The meta-information in the comment sentiment analysis task includes comment’s like number, reviewer level, additional image, deliver time, and sentence length . Besides the keyword query, CoSurvey provides customers a survey of cross-platform products price changing trends and comment sentiment evolutions.

In the current days, Greece is facing one of the worst economic crisis in its history, so price comparison engine usage is more than needed, especially for the most competitive and pricy goods, such as athletic footwear and technology ones. In such circumstances, companies have to find more efficient ways to get the absolutely necessary information from their targeted audience by overcoming the problems that a researcher can face with the usage of an ordinary questionnaire, because the customer has written his own point of view; using his own words without being guided by a questionnaire or an interview. This study tries to identify this crucial information and help the contemporary e-shop to improve its ecommerce services and gain more income with less advertising, cpc campaigns, etc. Hence, in this case we gathered from «Skroutz» one of the most renowned PCE in Greece and extracted the sentiment from these core industries target groups, based on the user’s/buyer’s comments and their rating.

Millions of products and thousands of sellers are competing against each other in an online marketplace. In this paper, we propose a framework to forecast demand for a product from a particular seller (referred as offer/seller-product demand in the paper). Inventory planning and placements based on these forecasts help sellers in lowering fulfilment costs, improving instock availability and increasing shorter delivery promises to the customers. Most of the recent forecasting approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e., during prediction, the future forecast mainly depends on the offer i.e. its historical sales and features. These approaches don’t consider the effect of other offers and hence, fail to capture the correlations across different sellers and products seen in situations like, (i) competition between sellers offering similar products, (ii) effect of a seller going out of stock for the product on competing seller, (iii) launch of new competing products/offers and (iv) cold start offers or offers with very limited historical sales data. In this paper, we propose a general demand forecasting framework for multivariate correlated time series. The proposed technique models the homogeneous and heterogeneous correlations between sellers and products across different time series using graph neural networks (GNN) and uses state-of-the-art forecasting models based upon LSTMs and TCNs for modelling individual time series. We have experimented with various GNN architectures such as GCNs, GraphSAGE and GATs for modelling the correlations.

Firstly, the calculation of the traditional supplier credit evaluation is optimized by introducing the decision matrix algorithm of the difference matrix and the cloud model evaluation method. Then a multi-objective joint decision model of supplier selection and order allocation is established, and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm combined with actual examples is applied to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm and model. Finally, the decision makers’ preferences are integrated into the intelligent decision-making, and the cloud model evaluation method is adopted. The rough set and gray relational analysis mathematical tools are used to construct the procurement supply evaluation system. The research results show that the comparison of the three general indicators of the procurement supply chain can be obtained through the cloud model evaluation calculation, which indirectly reflects the preference decision weights of the three objective functions of the cross-border e-commerce supplier selection and order allocation multi-objective optimization model.

In an e-commerce system, customer Web sessions have differing values for service providers. These tend to: give preference to customer Web sessions that are likely to bring more profit by providing better service quality. This paper proposes a reinforcement-learning based adaptive e-commerce system model that adapts the service quality level for different Web sessions within the customer’s navigation in order to maximize total profit. The e-commerce system is considered as an electronic supply chain which includes a network of basic e- providers used to supply e-commerce services for end customers. The learner agent noted as e-commerce supply chain manager (ECSCM) agent allocates a service quality level to the customer’s request based on his/her navigation pattern in the e-commerce Website and selects an optimized combination of service providers to respond to the customer’s request. To evaluate the proposed model, a multi agent framework composed of three agent types, the ECSCM agent, customer agent (buyer/browser) and service provider agent, is employed. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves total profits through cost reduction and revenue enhancement simultaneously and encourages customers to purchase from the Website through service quality adaptation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12599-019-00583-6,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

A user’s attention is mostly captured by homepage banner images (also called Ads/Creatives). The set of banners shown and their design, influence the customer’s interest and plays a key role in optimizing the click through rates of the banners. Presently, massive and repetitive effort is put in, to manually create aesthetically pleasing banner images. Due to the large amount of time and effort involved in this process, only a small set of banners are made live at any point. This reduces the number of banners created as well as the degree of personalization that can be achieved. This paper thus presents a method to generate creatives automatically on a large scale in a short duration. The availability of diverse banners generated helps in improving personalization as they can cater to the taste of larger audience. The focus of our paper is on generating a wide variety of homepage banners that can be made as an input for a user-level personalization engine.

These systems must be maintained and supported by people adapting the system to the user’s behavior. Users behavior can be tracked by analyzing the text inputs users do while they search for a product. The goal of this research was finding a way to automate this adaption process with considering the inputs of the users on a marketplace prototype for cloud services. To fulfill this task, modern methods of text processing such as stemming, and lemmatization were suitable. The problem has been solved by applying a self-learning algorithm combined with a self-updating database. The system now provides direct feedback recognizing wrong input.

Describing a dress using keywords does not always yield the proper results, which in turn leads to dissatisfaction of customers. A visual search based system will be enormously beneficent to the industry. Hence, we propose a framework that can retrieve similar clothes that can be found in an image. The first task is to extract the garment from the input image (street photo). There are various challenges for that, including pose, illumination, and background clutter. We use a Generative Adversarial Network for the task of retrieving the garment that the person in the image was wearing. It has been shown that GAN can retrieve the garment very efficiently despite the challenges of street photos. Finally, a siamese based matching system takes the retrieved cloth image and matches it with the clothes in the dataset, giving us the top k matches. We take a pre-trained inception-ResNet v1 module as a siamese network (trained using triplet loss for face detection) and fine-tune it on the shopping dataset using center loss. The dataset has been collected inhouse.

Given the size, diversity, and dynamism of our catalog, product search poses many challenges. It can be addressed by building supervised models to tagging product images with labels representing themes and later retrieving them by labels. This approach suffices for common and perennial themes like “white shirt” or “lifestyle image of TV”. It does not work for new themes such as “e-cigarettes”, hard-to-define ones such as “image with a promotional badge”, or the ones with short relevance span such as “Halloween costumes”. SIR is ideal for such cases because it allows us to search by an example, not a pre-defined theme. We describe the steps - embedding computation, encoding, and indexing - that power the approximate nearest neighbor search back-end. We also highlight two applications of SIR. The first one is related to the detection of products with various types of potentially objectionable themes. This application is run with a sense of urgency, hence the typical time frame to train and bootstrap a model is not permitted. Also, these themes are often short-lived based on current trends, hence spending resources to build a lasting model is not justified. The second application is a variant item detection system where SIR helps discover visual variants that are hard to find through text search.

To predict users’ ratings, first we capture gaze behavior while looking at high, neutral, and low visually appealing websites, followed by a survey regarding user perceptions on visual aesthetics towards the same websites. We conduct an experiment with 23 experienced users in online shopping, capture gaze behavior and through employing machine learning we examine how fast we can accurately predict their ratings. The findings show that after 25 s we can predict ratings with an error rate ranging from 9% to 11% depending on which facet of visual aesthetic is examined. Furthermore, within the first 15 s we can have a good and sufficient prediction for simplicity and colorfulness, with error rates 11% and 12% respectively. For diversity and craftsmanship, 20 s are needed to get a good and sufficient prediction similar to the one from 25 s. The findings indicate that we need more than 10 s of viewing time to be able to accurately capture perceptions on visual aesthetics.

Starting from a set of 3.23 million user-generated event logs of a bus ticketing platform, the methodology shows the correlation rules between travel features and the purchase of a ticket. Such rules are then used to train a machine learning model for predicting whether a user will buy or not a ticket. The results obtained by this study reveal that factors such as occupancy rate, fare of a ticket, and number of days passed from booking to departure, have significant influence on traveler’s buying decisions.

This new kind of interactions is defined by connections between users and consumable goods (products, articles, movies, etc.). And through these connections, knowledge can be found. This is the definition of data mining. Buying online has become mainstream due to its convenience and variety, but the enormous offering options affect negatively the user experience. Millions of products are displayed online, and frequently the search for the craved product is long and tiring.

In the context of e-commerce, accurate prediction of customer demand, typically captured by sales volume, requires careful analysis of multiple factors, namely, type of product, country of purchase, price, discount rate, free delivery option, online review sentiment etc., and their interactions. For e-tailers such as, Amazon, this kind of prediction capability is also extremely important in order to manage the supply chain efficiently as well as ensure customer satisfaction. This study investigates the efficacy of various modeling techniques, namely, regression analysis, decision-tree analysis and artificial neural network, for predicting the sales of books at amazon.in, using various relevant factors and their interactions as predictor variables. Sentiment analysis is carried out to measure the polarity of online reviews, which are included as predictors in these models. The importance of each independent predictor variable, such as discount rate, review sentiment etc., is analyzed based on the outcome of each model to determine top significant predictors which can be controlled by the marketer to influence sales. In terms of accuracy of prediction, the artificial neural network model is found to perform better than the decision-tree based model. In addition, the regression analysis, with and without sentiment and interaction factors, generates comparable results. The comparative analysis of these models reveals several significant findings. Firstly, all three models confirm that review volume is the most important and significant predictor of sales of books at amazon.in. Secondly, discount rate, discount amount and average ratings have minimal or insignificant effect on sales prediction. Thirdly, both negative sentiment and positive sentiment of the reviews are individually significant predictors as per regression and decision-tree model, but they are not significant at all as per neural network model. This observation from the neural network model is contrary to the extant research which claims that both negative and positive sentiment are significant with the former having more influence in predicting sales. Finally, the interaction effects of review volume with negative and positive sentiment are also found to be significant predictors as per all three models. Hence, overall, out of various factors used for sales prediction of books, review volume, negative sentiment, positive sentiment and their interactions are found to be the most significant ones across all models. The results of this study can be utilized by online sellers to accurately predict the sales volume by adjusting these significant factors, thereby managing the supply chain effectively.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10257-019-00438-3,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Besides using this mix of traditional marketing strategies, cashback websites attract new target customers and increase existing customers’ loyalty through recommendations, using a word-of-mouth marketing strategy built on economic incentives for users who refer others to these sites. The literature shows that this strategy is one of the major areas of success of this business model because customers who join following recommendation are more active and are therefore more profitable and loyal to the brand. Nevertheless, the new users who are referred to these sites vary considerably in terms of the number of transactions they make on the site.

The life cycle of e-trust in online Business to Consumer (B2C) transactions takes multiple stages from beginning to end. The first stage involves the complete unawareness of online shoppers about online sellers. Then, individual trust begins to develop, endure, recover and ultimately sustain or diminish. Since it is a complicated task to gain trust, there have been numerous solutions, methods and models proposed so far to create, maintain, measure, enhance and prevent loss of trust. One of the solutions that has long been adopted to determine trust level in B2C is a concentration on the history or background of online shoppers (customers) and online sellers (companies) so as to obtain reliable data or identify trust level. This paper attempted to adopt the machine learning algorithms to analyze decisions about the past and history of individuals/companies and trust in e-business/e-commerce (EC).

This rapid assessment needs to occur as the disaster unfolds and immediately after the disaster, even while data is scarce and emerging. Marketing communication techniques and modern information technology methods (machine learning, geospatial information, and social media text mining) can help with these tasks. This paper shows how to use predictive modeling and geospatial interpolation along with machine learning for pre-disaster community planning, for risk management actions during the disaster, and for assisting in creating informed structure regulations to assist in disaster resilience. As disaster response is an ongoing process, the technique provides a framework of spatial level loss estimation using limited evolving data and iteratively improves estimation as more data becomes available. Predictive and probabilistic modeling starts with historical data (compiled before the event) including data such as damage to a specific building type as a function of water depth or wind speed. Topography of the land involved is assessed using satellite and LIDAR data and publically available flood maps created by FEMA for the National Flood Insurance Program and topographic maps produced in the US Topo project of the National Geospatial Program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). These baseline GIS datasets are overlaid with GIS-located data on building type and construction materials and usage scraped from county tax assessor websites. After buildings are GIS mapped, the FEMA’s HAZUS algorithm is used to estimate damages to each building as a function of projected area water depth. The water depth projection is determined by regression using wind speed and recurrence interval (i.e., Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017 was a 1 in 1,000 year event). As data becomes gradually available, we iteratively update estimates for areas using spatial interpolation. This informs communication modes of contact. To better assess impact area and population at risk with limited data, machine learning is applied. In disasters people often are active on mobile phones. GIS located text mining messages reveals who needs what and where, directs rescue, and improve damage estimates when data is sparse, and allow target messaging to vulnerable populations (Lazreg et al. 2016).

The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of a single product. However, in a situation where large quantities of related time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial. Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes, in situations where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate.

Some fraudulent pretenders consider this as an opportunity to write the spam reviews to upgrade or degrade product’s reputation. Hence, detection of those reviews are very essential for preserving the interests of users. To date, number of researches have been proposed in order to detect the spam reviews and to provide the genuine resources for customers and business person. However, we found few limitations in existing supervised approaches. First, most of the supervised approaches have used manual labelling of reviews into spam and non-spam. However, due to identical appearance of reviews manual labelling can not be considered as authentic. Second, the scarcity of spam reviews leads to data imbalance problem. Third, computing similarities among reviews naturally needs expensive computation. In this work, we propose a novel and robust, spam review detection system which efficiently employ following three features: (i) sentiments of review and its comments, (ii) content based factor, and (iii) rating deviation. To address the aforementioned limitations, we investigated all these features for only suspicious review list in which only those reviews have kept which received comments by peer users.

One of the widely-used marketing strategies, called Lucky Money, is capable of encouraging customers to buy products from marketplaces. However, the amount of luck money for each customer is usually randomly determined or even manually determined and cannot fully achieve the business objectives. This paper proposes a machine-learning based lucky money determination approach, called DAliM, for e-commerce businesses to achieve their desired goals. We implement DAliM for the “Double 11 Global Shopping Festival 2017” initiated by Alibaba Group and evaluate it using a few hundred million real customers from all over the world. The experimental results demonstrate that our method manages to decrease the lucky money spent by 41.71% and increase the final purchase rate by 24.94% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_53,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, plays a vital role in creating a great experience at e-commerce companies. Machine learning techniques follow different efficient ways to extract knowledge from huge amount of data. A reliable products analysis of the performance of any e-commerce company is critical. However, due to its various global infrastructures, many likely products get grouped in a different way. So, the analysis of quality of product always depends on the accuracy of the products classification. The better the classification, the more insights can be generating good category of products. Classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The main motto of this study is to compare the performance analysis (basis of accuracy). Different machine learning (supervised) methods are used to classify the products. In this paper we compare different machine learning techniques (Nonlinear and rule-based) to classify the products. These approaches have been tested with data from the Kaggle Otto Group Product Classification dataset. The performances of algorithms are measured in two cases, i.e., dataset before feature selection (before preprocessing) and dataset set after feature selection (after preprocessing) and compared in terms of accuracy. The experimental result shows that the overall performance of nonlinear machine learning (KNN) techniques is better than rule-based (C5.0) techniques. The result shows that among the individual classifiers implemented, k -nearest neighbor is having highest accuracy of around 88%. An extensive study is given to explain the efficiency of different classifiers.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-10-5547-8_10,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Potential consumers exhibit sincere intents in seeking opinions of other consumers. These consumers have had a usage experience of the products they are intending to make a purchase decision on. The underlying businesses also deem it fit to ascertain common public opinions regarding the quality of their products as well as services. However, the consumer reviews have bulked over time to such an extent that it has become a highly challenging task to read all the reviews and detect their genuineness. Hence, it is crucial to manage reviews since spammers can manipulate the reviews to demote or promote wrong product. The paper proposes an algorithm for detecting the fake reviews. Since the proposed work concentrates only on text. So, n-gram (unigram + bigram) features are used. Supervised learning technique is used for reviews filtering. The proposed algorithm considers the combination of multiple learning algorithms for better predictive performance.

The person who actually uses the product is called the adopter . Product adopter information is important for learning user interests and understanding purchase behaviors. However, effective acquisition or prediction of product adopter information has not been well studied. Existing methods mainly rely on explicit extraction patterns, and can only identify exact occurrences of adopter mentions from review data. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Labeled Network Embedding approach (NLNE) to inferring product adopter information from purchase records. Compared with previous studies, our method does not require any review text data, but try to learn effective prediction model using only purchase records, which are easier to obtain than review data. Specially, we first propose an Adopter-labeled User-Product Network Embedding (APUNE) method to learn effective representations for users, products and adopter labels. Then, we further propose a neural prediction approach for inferring product adopter information based on the learned embeddings using APUNE. Our NLNE approach not only retains the expressive capacity of labeled network embedding, but also is endowed with the predictive capacity of neural networks.

Preferences of customers on various products can now be readily obtained on-line through various E-commerce Websites. As these E-commerce sites provide their customers with many choices they get in dilemma with this information and hence find it difficult to locate items of their interest. These E-commerce systems cannot offer one to one recommendation like a salesperson does and that’s why customers are not able to choose products of their choice and hence there is a risk of losing loyal customers. Our main concern is to fulfill the needs of every customer and increase the product sales. Efficiently mining this information can generate useful data for providing personalized product recommendation services. Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the preferred tool for data mining and it’s a computational model based on biological neural networks, which consists of an interconnected group of neurons and it processes the information using a connection based approach. This paper presents a new approach using ANN that can be used to generate recommendations and help customers to satisfy their requirements. In this work the buying pattern of the students appearing for campus interviews has been taken into consideration and recommends the similar type of items to other student groups.

When a new user comes to an e-commerce website, it is interesting to study whether the information from external social media platforms can be utilized to alleviate the cold-start problem. In this paper, we focus on a specific task on cross-site information sharing, i.e., leveraging the text posted by a user on the social media platform (termed as social text) to infer his/her purchase preference of product categories on an e-commerce platform. To solve the task, a key problem is how to effectively represent the social text in a way that its information can be utilized on the e-commerce platform. We study two major kinds of text representation methods for predicting cross-site purchase preference, including shallow textual features and deep textual features learned by deep neural network models. We conduct extensive experiments on a large linked dataset, and our experimental results indicate that it is promising to utilize the social text for predicting purchase preference.

Increase in disposable income, easy availability of credit, and growth of shopping malls has increased the impulsive buying behaviour. A vast number of retailers and marketers believe that purchasing decisions are generally made inside the store. To capture the attention of shoppers, retailers invest a huge amount on in-store promotion and store environment endeavouring to enhance shopper experience. Unable to accurately predict the impulsive buying behaviour of their shoppers, retailers get caught in either stockpile or stock out conditions. For years, marketers have been generically forecasting sales for their retail outlets. However, despite various forecasting techniques available, predicting impulsive purchasing has remained under-explored. This paper addresses this gap using neural network model to predict such buying behaviour. With statistical evidence, neural network model has been found to be significantly good in terms of its predicting power. To gain more insights from the model, authors have identified the factors that have significant impact on customers’ impulsive buying.

VEML provides application programmers with potential to globally develop different kinds of MAS based on their requirements and applications. We have implemented a multi autonomous agent based system called VE System . We demonstrate efficacy of our system by discussing experimental results and its salient features.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-84882-215-3_19,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

The results show that, in short-term prediction of data transmission, GM is an effective way and RBF has perfect ability to study and map. CGNN model and neural network have dual properties of trend and fluctuation under the condition of combining with the time-dependent sequence data. It is concluded that great improvement, comparing with trend prediction and simple factor in CGNN model, has been made to analyze data transmission.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-01216-7_73,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

When a web server is overloaded there is a significant loss of throughput when we compare finished sessions and the number of responses per second; longer sessions are usually the ones ending in sales but also the most sensitive to load failures. Session-based admission control systems maintain a high QoS for a limited number of sessions, but does not maximize revenue as it treats all non-logged sessions the same. We present a novel method for learning to assign priorities to sessions according to the revenue that will generate. For this, we use traditional machine learning techniques and Markov-chain models. We are able to train a system to estimate the probability of the user’s purchasing intentions according to its early navigation clicks and other static information. The predictions can be used by admission control systems to prioritize sessions or deny them if no resources are available, thus improving sales throughput per unit of time for a given infrastructure. We test our approach on access logs obtained from a high-traffic online travel agency, with promising results.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-73078-1_63,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In many industries, firms adjust the product price dynamically by the current product inventory and the future demand distribution. In this paper, we used particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to train neural networks, then introduced the PSO-trained neural network into e-commerce and presented a new dynamic pricing method based on PSO-trained neural networks. In the method, from production function principles we obtained the least variable cost, and by making the error of mean square between the actual outputs and expectation outputs minimal we got the optimal dynamic price of products. The PSO-trained neural network can simplify the rapid change of prices and can successfully set the optimal dynamic prices in e-commerce.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-0-387-75466-6_36,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

We consider the fact that the quality of a good offered by multiple selling agents may not be the same, and a selling agent may alter the quality of its goods. In our approach, buying agents learn to avoid the risk of purchasing low quality goods and to maximize their expected value of goods by dynamically maintaining sets of reputable and disreputable sellers. Selling agents learn to maximize their expected profits by adjusting product prices and optionally altering the quality of their goods. This paper focusses on presenting results from experiments investigating the behaviour of an e-market populated with our buying and selling agents. Our results show that such a market can reach an equilibrium state where the agent population remains stable, and this equilibrium is optimal for the participant agents.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF03037648,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

Several e-markets, specifically for construction, have also been established, including bLiquid.com and ProcureZone. However, most websites provide only two primary ways of searching for information, namely by index/menu or by keyword. Instead of relying on the primitive search engines found in most procurement websites, a search guide system could help a user’s keyword search by reducing the number of keywords required to find the desired information. Our research recognized that professional procurement experience helped users more effectively carry out website information searches, by using fewer keywords. We planned to capture such experience in order to guide inexperienced users in their search. The research goal was to improve search effectiveness by guiding the user’s search using three approaches; namely correction, specification and extension. Based on these three approaches, this research applied the following guides: correction; specification-by-equivalence; specification-by-detail; extension-by-time; extension-by-location; extension-by-team; and extension-by-component. The paper will describe how we classified users for learning credibility, and the learning framework for recording expert users’ search patterns. Twelve professionals, using 14 procurement packages, with 64 items in total, evaluated the proposed framework. It will be demonstrated that the proposed learning keyword guide facilitated a dynamic, customized menu and indexing system, and reduced the number of keywords required for the professionals to find the information they desired.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/0-387-29295-0_8,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')

In contrast, LCW's estimate of the mean preferences of a customer population improved as the number of customers increased, even for larger numbers of features of widely differing importance. This improvement in the estimate of mean customer preferences led to improved prediction of individual customers' rankings, irrespective of the extent of variation among customers and whether a single or multiple retrievals were permitted.

However, the application of intelligence in EC is confined by the state-of-the-art of the AI although EC has a high potential of AI deployment. In this talk, we will review the status of AI applications in EC, and a research opportunity for future applications The key AI technologies applied in EC include agents for search, comparison, and negotiations; search by configuration and salesman expert systems; thesaurus of EC terms; knowledge-based processing of workflow; personalized e-catalog directory management; data mining in customer relationship management; natural language conversation, voice recognition and synthesis, and machine translation. 1. Agent : Concerning the agents, we will discuss the trend of XML standard such as ebXML for search, communication, and price negotiation. We will also review the status of learning from the seller and buyer agents’ point of view. 2. Search by configuration : Most searches seek standard commodities, while many products like electronic goods need to add optional parts to fulfill the required specification. This implies that we need to find a most similar template first, and then to adjust the optional parts that offer the minimum cost. 3. Thesaurus to aid comparison shopping : The product specification should be comparable each other whether they are represented in numbers, symbols, and words. To comprehend the specifications for comparison, we need a thesaurus of application domain. 4. Personalized e-catalog directory management : A buyer site defines a personalized e-catalog directory out of common standard catalog.

In this paper we study algorithms that make a sequence of single rent-to-buy decisions, using the assumption that the resource use times are independently drawn from an unknown probability distribution. Our study of this rent-to-buy problem is motivated by important systems applications, specifically, problems arising from deciding when to spindown disks to conserve energy in mobile computers [4], [13], [15], thread blocking decisions during lock acquisition in multiprocessor applications [7], and virtual circuit holding times in IP-over-ATM networks [11], [19]. We develop a provably optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for the rent-to-buy problem. Our algorithm uses $ O(\sqrt{t}) $ time and space, and its expected cost for the t th resource use converges to optimal as $ O(\sqrt{ log t/t}) $ , for any bounded probability distribution on the resource use times. Alternatively, using O(1) time and space, the algorithm almost converges to optimal. We describe the experimental results for the application of our algorithm to one of the motivating systems problems: the question of when to spindown a disk to save power in a mobile computer. Simulations using disk access traces obtained from an HP workstation environment suggest that our algorithm yields significantly improved power / response time performance over the nonadaptive 2-competitive algorithm which is optimal in the worst-case competitive analysis model.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/PL00009249,springer,e-commerce,'e-commerce' AND 'machine learning' AND ('real-world' AND 'deploy')
