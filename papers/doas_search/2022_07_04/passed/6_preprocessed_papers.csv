 BACKGROUND
 Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is a common name for various Artificial Intelligence (AI)-infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions towards the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models employed, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 This study provides a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyze: 1) specific AI models employed in AАL systems, 2) the target domains of the models, 3) the technology using the models, and 4) the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal is to consolidate research on the topic and inform end-users, healthcare professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems.
 
 
 METHODS
 The study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing (NLP) toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. The relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. The review included five digital libraries: the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI).
 
 
 RESULTS
 The annual distribution of relevant articles shows a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to November 2021. The AI models started with unsupervised approaches as the leader, followed by deep learning (dominant from 2020), instance-based learning, and supervised techniques. Activity recognition and assistance were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, wearable, and mobile technologies mainly implemented the models. Older adults were primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern, and to less extent, reliability, safety, privacy, and security.
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 The study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should: involve healthcare professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulation, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with healthcare technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.

This enhances the quality of service (QoS) to the proximity of end ‐ users as latency ‐ free processing is obtained in cloud ‐ IoT ‐ based environs. Mining industry will encounter a level ‐ up due to these technological advancements like fog ‐ IoT ‐ based systems. Monitoring mining activities such as blasting, slope monitoring, and miner tracking are time ‐ sensitive. Hence, instant response is demand of extreme mine environment so that life and property are not compromised.

To do this, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN-) based fall detection method using a heart rate sensor and an accelerometer. Acquiring fall data compared with normal behavioral data can be an arduous process. Instead, we introduce a compelling GAN-based anomaly detection partially surrounded with User Initial information features (UI-GAN). Although GAN-based anomaly detection methods have been previously proposed, each model has its adequate suitability for each anomaly detection application. Therefore, this study firstly evaluates suitable GAN-based anomaly detection models for fall detection from among nine recently proposed GAN-based models. From UI-GAN, performance improvements are observed in the fall detection when using the UI information. To objectively demonstrate the competitive performance of UI-GAN, we compare it with eight other recently presented fall detection studies and have observed that it leads to better results. Lastly, since the target application in this study is the use of UI-GAN with a wearable device, the sufficiently satisfied latency of UI-GAN on the smartwatch is estimated. This study is the first attempt to use the initial information of users in GAN, and we hope that the effectiveness of the UI information is expected to be seen in other applications.",IEEE Sensors Journal,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

First, it presents and discusses a comprehensive comparative study, where 19 different machine learning methods were used to develop fall detection systems, to deduce the optimal machine learning method for the development of such systems. This study was conducted on two different datasets, and the results show that out of all the machine learning methods, the k-NN classifier is best suited for the development of fall detection systems in terms of performance accuracy. Second, it presents a framework that overcomes the limitations of binary classifier-based fall detection systems by being able to detect falls and fall-like motions. Third, to increase the trust and reliance on fall detection systems, it introduces a novel methodology based on the usage of k-folds cross-validation and the AdaBoost algorithm that improves the performance accuracy of the k-NN classifier-based fall detection system to the extent that it outperforms all similar works in this field. This approach achieved performance accuracies of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively, when evaluated on the two datasets. Finally, the proposed approach is also highly accurate in detecting the activity of standing up from a lying position to infer whether a fall was followed by a long lie, which can cause minor to major health-related concerns.

For the medical wisdom, the fall detection has attracted the considerable attention from the global researchers and medical institutions. It is very difficult for the traditional fall detection strategies to realize the intelligent detection with the following three reasons: (i) the data collection cannot reach the real-time level; (ii) the adopted detection methods cannot satisfy the enough stability; and (iii) the computation overhead of collection device is very high, which causes the barely satisfactory detection effect. Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The industrial Internet, as a highly cooperative and intelligence-sharing global network that connects entities, human beings, and the environment in smart manufacturing, is the core of this revolution. However, most current research on the industrial Internet is restricted to IoT, cloud computing, or big data, respectively. The synergy between the cloud and clients is currently at a very primary stage of sensing, connection, and knowledge, lacking a cloud-client-integrative architecture and key technologies that could meet the evolving requirements of networked smart production, including more complex objects to be sensed, more diversification of entities to be connected, faster data processing, and more intelligent feedback control. This paper first surveys some important research directions with respect to this research field and summarizes the research status and challenges. On this basis, a novel cloud-client integrative industrial Internet architecture and solutions for related key technologies are proposed. Then, the proposed technologies are demonstrated for some specific applications in the field of intelligent manufacturing. Finally, the prospects for cloud-client-integrative industrial Internet research are discussed and concluded.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

However, interface incompatibilities and performance limitations often compel users to either transfer data between a file system and object storage or use inefficient file connectors over object stores. The result is growing storage sprawl, unacceptably low performance, and an increase in associated storage costs. One promising solution to this problem is providing dual access, the ability to transparently read and write the same data through both file system interfaces and object storage APIs. In this position paper we argue that there is a need for dual-access file systems over object storage, and examine some representative use cases which benefit from such systems. Based on our conversations with end users, we discuss features which we believe are essential or desirable in a dual-access object storage file system (OSFS). Further, we design and implement an early prototype of Agni1, an efficient dual-access OSFS which overcomes the shortcomings of existing approaches. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that for some representative workloads Agni can improve performance by 20%–60% compared to either S3FS, a popular OSFS, or the prevalent approach of manually copying data between different storage systems.",HotStorage,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This paper describes the collection of data using Internet of Things. Earlier, GSM was used to get entry to constrained information but it offers one manner verbal exchange based totally on queuing protocol. It consumes more time. To overcome this trouble, we have used cloud computing at the side of Internet of Things. Using Internet of Things, you may access extra wide variety of data at anytime from anywhere since the information are stored in the cloud. The sensors used will continuously sense the information and store it to the cloud. When the sensed value exceeds the threshold limit the buzzer will operate and the information will be displayed in the LCD. The IoT also helps to send this information to as many persons required by the industry to monitor and control it.

However, interface incompatibilities and performance limitations inhibit its adoption for emerging cloud-based workloads. Users are compelled to either run their applications over expensive block storage-based file systems or use inefficient file connectors over object stores. Dual access, the ability to read and write the same data through file systems interfaces and object storage APIs, has promise to improve performance and eliminate storage sprawl. We design and implement Agni1, an efficient, distributed, dual-access object storage file system (OSFS), that uses standard object storage APIs and cloud microservices. Our system overcomes the performance shortcomings of existing approaches by implementing a multi-tier write aggregating data structure and by integrating with existing cloud-native services.

In machine automation systems, any additional computing hardware can be cumbersome to install, making upgrades hard to apply. This paper presents a cloud-extended sensor network with supervisory control in a public cloud. The hardware and cloud resources used in the solution are low-cost, reducing the up-front costs compared to the use of high-end components. The system collects data from ST microprocessor (STM)-based sensor nodes that send inertial measurement data using user datagram protocol (UDP). The sensor itself is a Bosch BMI160, a cheap and small inertial measurement unit (IMU). The system is designed to be used in machine automation applications where the frequency of the sensory data produced is hundreds of hertz. The system is to provide low-latency data transfer to the cloud. In the cloud environment, data is collected by a computing service that can be programmed to perform algorithms on it. The system is tested in a setup consisting of five IMU sensors and an angle measurement unit attached to a hydraulically actuated flexible beam. The test setup aims to update a local control system's parameters based on a cloud algorithm and camera measurements of the beam tip position. The control results and communication latency are inspected. The main advantages of the proposed solution are the simple system architecture and cost savings with the use of low-cost sensors and cloud resources. The focus of this study is the functionality of such a system; intricate security issues are beyond the scope of this study.","2017 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM)",2017,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Compared to computers, the performance of deep learning model performance degrades when deployed on a mobile phone and requires a systematic approach to find a model that performs optimally on both computers and mobile phones. By following the proposed pipeline, which consists of various computational tools, simple procedural recipes, and technical considerations, one can bring the power of deep learning medical image classification to mobile devices, potentially unlocking new domains of applications. The pipeline is demonstrated on four different publicly available datasets: COVID X-rays, COVID CT scans, leaves, and colorectal cancer.

We found that transferring deep learning models to a mobile phone is limited by hardware and classification accuracy drops. To address this issue, we proposed this pipeline to find an optimized model for mobile phones.

At present, smart agriculture has gradually realized unmanned and automatic management, which can realize monitoring, supervision, and real-time image monitoring. However, the data in smart agriculture system cannot be guaranteed to be complete and vulnerable to attack. Based on this, this paper studies and analyzes the application of edge computing and blockchain in smart agriculture systems. Based on the simple analysis of the development of smart agriculture, the edge computing framework and the advantages of blockchain are used to build the framework system of smart agriculture. The classical architecture of edge computing and the confidentiality of blockchain are used to realize the analysis and storage of data. In view of the shortcomings of crop image overlap detection, it is proposed to detect the overlapping area and determine the feature points to analyze the image based on the edge computing and hash algorithm. In terms of data integrity, based on the advantages of blockchain, an edge data detection method based on short signature is proposed, and experiments are designed to analyze the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the image mosaic algorithm can extract the contour information of the image and realize the fast image matching.

Managing the supply of animal protein required hunter gatherer communities to be able to domesticate and contain wild animals. Over the ages the fence has become ingrained in the very fabric of society and created a culture of control and ownership. Garett Hardin's article titled “The Tragedy of the Commons” suggested that shared land, typified by access to a fenceless common resource, was doomed to failure due to a human instinct for mistrust and exploitation. Perhaps the fence has created an ingrained societal cultural response. While natural ecosystems do have physical boundaries, these are based on natural environmental zones. Landscapes are more porous and resilience is built up through animal's being able to respond to dynamic changes. This paper explores the opportunity for remote monitoring technologies to create open fenceless landscapes and how this might be integrated into the growing need for humans to access animal protein.",Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Thus, the environment for livestock (limited to pigs in this paper) in the barn is properly maintained for its growth conditions. However, due to poor environments such as closed pig houses, lack of stable power supply, inexperienced livestock management, and power outages, the failure of these environment equipment is high. Thus, there are difficulties in detecting its malfunctions during equipment operation. In this paper, based on deep learning, we provide a mechanism to quickly detect anomalies of multiple equipment (environmental sensors and controllers, etc.) in each pig house at the same time. In particular, environmental factors (temperature, humidity, CO2, ventilation, radiator temperature, external temperature, etc.) to be used for learning were extracted through the analysis of data accumulated for the generation of predictive models of each equipment. In addition, the optimal recurrent neural network (RNN) environment was derived by analyzing the characteristics of the learning RNN. In this way, the accuracy of the prediction model can be improved. In this paper, the real-time input data (only in the case of temperature) was intentionally induced above the threshold, and 93% of the abnormalities were detected to determine whether the equipment was abnormal.",Electronics,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In conventional livestock management, decisions are mostly based on the appraisal, judgment, and experience of the farmer, veterinarian, and workers. The increasing demand for production and the number of animals makes it difficult for humans to keep track of animals. It is clear that a person is not able to continuously watch the animals 24 hours a day to receive reliable audio-visual data for management. Recent technologies already changed the information flow from animal to human, which helps people to collect reliable information and transform it into an operational decision-making process (eg reproduction management or calving surveillance). Today, livestock farming must combine requirements for a transparent food supply chain, animal welfare, health, and ethics as a traceable-sustainable model by obtaining and processing reliable data using novel technologies.

Combining the blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance the transparency and sustainability of agricultural supply chains, has attracted researchers from both academia and industry. This paper reviews the latest applications of the blockchain and IoT technologies in the sustainable agricultural supply chain management and explores the design and implementation of a blockchain-based sustainable solution. By placing the sustainable agricultural supply chain management at its core, a blockchain-based framework is designed. Considering the hetero-geneity of the transaction data and the IoT data, the openness of sustainability information and the sensitivity of participants’ data, a double-chain structure is proposed including the consensus method, the transaction mechanisms, the sustainability assessment method and the performance optimization strategy. The sustainable management practices of all participants are introduced into the blockchain network, especially those allowing the government to play a more significant role in agriculture supply management. Meanwhile, to meet the scenario requirements, a data reduction method is designed to improve performance and reduce block size. Simulations are performed to evaluate the latency, throughput, costs and efficiency of the proposed structure. This paper can be a useful reference for further research on the application of blockchain and IoT technologies in sustainable agricultural management.","Computers, Materials & Continua",2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a data-driven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC.",Sensors,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The change is being propagated into the wave of transforming the existing system with a vertical structure into the corresponding horizontal platform or middleware. Accordingly, the way of acquiring IIoT data from an individual system is being altered to the way of being increasingly centralized through an integrated middleware of a scalable server or through a large platform. That said, middleware-based IIoT data acquisition must consider multiple factors, such as infrastructure (e.g., operation environment and network), protocol heterogeneity, interoperability (e.g., links with legacy systems), real-time, and security. This manuscript explains these five aspects in detail and provides a taxonomy of eighteen state-of-the-art IIoT data-acquisition middleware systems based on these aspects. To validate one of these aspects (network), we present our evaluation results at a real production site where IIoT data-acquisition loss rates are compared between wireless (long-term evolution) and wired networks. As a result, the wired communication can be more suitable for centralized IIoT data-acquisition middleware than wireless networks.

There are a number of reasons for this limited expansion of technologies for pastured animals, including networking availability and reliability, power requirements, and expense, among others. The objective of this work was to demonstrate a rapidly deployable long-range radio (LoRa) based, low-cost sensor suite that can be used to track location and activity of pastured livestock. The sensor is comprised of an inexpensive Arduino-compatible microprocessor, a generic MPU-9250 motion sensor which contains a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, and a 3-axis gyroscope, a generic GPS receiver, and a RFM95W generic LoRa radio. The microprocessor can be programmed flexibly using the open source Arduino IDE software to adjust the frequency of sampling, the data packet to send, and what conditions are needed to operate. The LoRa radio transmits to a Dragino LoRa gateway which can also be flexibly programmed through the Arduino IDE software to send data to local storage or, in cases where a web or cellular connection is available, to cloud storage. The sensor was powered using a USB cord connected to a 3,350 mAh lithium-ion battery pack. The Dragino gateway was programmed to upload data to the ThingSpeak IoT application programming interface for data storage, handling, and visualization. Evaluations showed minimal benefit associated with reducing sampling frequency as a strategy to preserve battery life. Packet loss ranged from 40% to 60%. In a 3 d evaluation on pastured sheep, the sensor suite was able to report GPS locations, inertial sensor readings, and temperature. Preliminary demonstrations of our system are satisfactory to detect animal location based on GPS data in real-time. This system has clear utility as a lower-cost strategy to deploy flexible, useful precision technologies for pasture-based livestock species.",Translational animal science,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Automated crop disease detection is a major issue in the current agricultural industry due to its cluttered background. Internet of Things (IoT) has gained immense interest in the past decade, as it accumulates a high level of contextual information to identify crop diseases. This study paper presents a novel method based on Taylor‐Water Wave Optimization‐based Generative Adversarial Network (Taylor‐WWO‐based GAN) to identify diseases in the agricultural industry. In this method, the IoT nodes sense the plant leaves, and the sensed data are transmitted to the Base Station (BS) using Fractional Gravitational Gray Wolf Optimization. This technique selects the optimal path for data transmission. After performing IoT routing, crop diseases are recognized at the BS. For detecting crop disease, the input image acquired from the IoT routing phase is then forwarded to the next step, that is, preprocessing, to improve the quality of the image for further processing. Then, Segmentation Network (SegNet) is adapted to segment the images, and extraction of significant features is performed using the acquired segments. The extracted features are adapted by the GAN, which is trained by Taylor‐WWO. The proposed Taylor‐WWO is newly devised by integrating the Taylor series and WWO algorithms. The proposed Taylor‐WWO‐based GAN showed improved performance with a maximum accuracy of 91.6%, maximum sensitivity of 89.3%, and maximum specificity of 92.3% in comparison with existing methods.",Int.

Twenty-first century agricultural producers will be facing the challenge of achieving food security and efficiency. This must be achieved while ensuring sustainable agricultural systems and overcoming the problems posed by climate change, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to extreme weather conditions. Those environmental consequences will directly affect the price setting process. In view of the price oscillations and the lack of transparent information for buyers, a multi-agent system (MAS) is presented in this article. It supports the making of decisions in the purchase of sustainable agricultural products. The proposed MAS consists of a system that supports decision-making when choosing a supplier on the basis of certain preference-based parameters aimed at measuring the sustainability of a supplier and a deep Q-learning agent for agricultural future market price forecast. Therefore, different agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) have been considered, as well as the use of edge computing technologies to reduce costs of data transfer to the cloud. The presented MAS combines price setting optimizations and user preferences in regards to accessing, filtering, and integrating information. The agents filter and fuse information relevant to a user according to supplier attributes and a dynamic environment. The results presented in this paper allow a user to choose the supplier that best suits their preferences as well as to gain insight on agricultural future markets price oscillations through a deep Q-learning agent.",Sensors,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The best available techniques (BATs) that are suggested by the integrated environmental permit system (IEPS) play a pivotal role in providing state-of-the-art approaches and techniques to workplaces. For the workplaces that install facilities with the BATs, it is necessary to perform real-time monitoring to determine whether pollutant emission facilities and treatment facilities are operating normally and whether such facilities can maintain the optimal condition during the emission of pollutants. The environmental management measures used before the IEPS had limitations for workplaces that are subjected to integrated environmental management because they consider the entire workplace as a single pollution source by combining all media. In addition, only the emission concentrations and amounts of pollutants were monitored because only the points at which most pollutants are discharged, i.e., stacks for air pollutant emission facilities and final effluent outlets for water pollutant emission facilities, are monitored. These monitoring approaches in a variety of facilities involve considerable costs, and most of them (95% for stacks in workplaces under IEPS, Korea) cannot perform real-time observation even though some of them are capable of it (5% for stacks managed by Tele Monitoring System, TMS). In this study, the applicability of a wireless sensor monitoring network was examined as a new approach for environmental management in workplaces. Based on the sensor monitoring network, surrogate parameters that can indirectly monitor the critical operating factors of pollutant emission and prevention facilities were developed and then measured in real time to examine the status of these facilities. Surrogate parameters can be used instead of directly measuring pollutants as the former has high efficiency, such as cost reduction, and can provide reliable data on the emission characteristics of pollutants. The wireless network is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform under real-time conditions in the emission and production facilities in a workplace. This study suggested that a wireless network using the IoT platform improves the BAT assessment methodology to understand the efficiency of environmental pollution reduction and the economic contribution to the workplace.",Sustainability,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

This volume of data is stored and processed in the Cloud, with the purpose of obtaining knowledge and valuable information for organizations. Edge Computing has emerged to reduce the costs associated with transferring, processing and storing data from IoT environments in the Cloud. This paradigm allows data to be pre-processed at the edge of the network before they are sent to the Cloud, obtaining shorter response times and maintaining service even during communication breakdowns between the IoT and Cloud layers. Furthermore, there is a increasing trend to shared physical network resources among diverse user entities through Software-Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization with the aim to reduce costs. In this sense, smart mechanisms are required to optimize virtual dataflows in the networks, as Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the digitalization of animal farming with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, specifically biosensors, big data, and block chain technology. Biosensors are noninvasive or invasive sensors that monitor an animal’s health and behavior in real time, allowing farmers to monitor individual animals and integrate this data for population-level analyses. The data from the sensors is processed using big data-processing techniques such as data modelling. These technologies use algorithms to sort through large, complex data sets to provide farmers with biologically relevant and usable data. Blockchain technology allows for traceability of animal products from farm to table, a key advantage in monitoring disease outbreaks and preventing related economic losses and food-related health pandemics. With these PLF technologies, animal agriculture can become more transparent and regain consumer trust. While the digitalization of animal farming has the potential to address a number of pressing concerns, these technologies are relatively new. The implementation of PLF technologies on farms will require increased collaboration between farmers, animal scientists, and engineers to ensure that technologies can be used in realistic, on-farm conditions. These technologies will call for data models that can sort through large amounts of data while accounting for specific variables and ensuring automation, accessibility, and accuracy of data. Issues with data privacy, security, and integration will need to be addressed before there can be multi-farm databases. Lastly, the usage of blockchain technology in animal agriculture is still in its infancy; blockchain technology has the potential to improve the traceability and transparency of animal products, but more research is needed to realize its full potential.

This challenge is even more complicated when edge intelligent devices are involved in the process. The low-quality image having challenges such as blur, low resolution, and contrast make it more difficult for text detection and classification. Therefore, such exigent aspect is considered in the study. The technology proposed is comprised of three main contributions. (a) After synthetic blurring, the blurred image is preprocessed, and then the deblurring process is applied to recover the image. (b) Subsequently, the standard maximal stable extreme regions (MSER) technique is applied to localize and detect text. Soon after, K-Means is applied to get three different clusters of the query image to separate foreground and background and also incorporate character level grouping. (c) Finally, the segmented text is classified into textual and non-textual regions using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. The purpose of this task is to overcome the false positives. For evaluation of proposed technique, results are obtained on three mainstream datasets, including SVT, IIIT5K and ICDAR 2003. The achieved classification results of 90.3% for SVT dataset, 95.8% for IIIT5K dataset, and 94.0% for the ICDAR 2003 dataset, respectively.

This industry needs to adapt to the current market through an efficient use of resources while being environmentally friendly. The most commonly used approaches for analyzing efficiency and sustainability on farms are production efficiency based analyses, such as Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis, since they allow to see how efficient the outputs are generated regardless of the units of measurement of the inputs. This work presents a real scenario for making farms more profitable and sustainable through the analysis of the Data Envelopment Analysis and the application of the Internet of Things and Edge Computing. What makes this model interesting is that it allows monitoring the ambient conditions with real-time data from the different sensors that have been installed on the farm, minimizing costs and gaining robustness in the transmission of the data to the cloud with Edge Computing, and then to have a complete overview in terms of monthly resource efficiency through the Data Envelopment Analysis. The results show that including the costs of edge and non-edge data transfer have an impact on the efficiency.

Location estimation can be affected by factors such as node density, topological diversity, and sensor coverage. As such, we propose a hybrid approach using multistage collaborative calibration for wireless sensor network localization, specifically in 3D environments. This technique integrates a Modified version of Light Gradient Boosting Model (MLGB), which is based on a regression scheme, a cooperative methodology, and a fine calibration model for collaborative fusion. These techniques were combined with quadrilateral shrunk centroid (QSC) and distance vector hop algorithms, using a multi-communication radius and an improved frog-leaping algorithm (DVMFL). In the first step, MLGB was used to correct for inhomogeneous localization estimation errors and RSSI data sparsity. As a result, the model is capable of adapting to high topological diversity (i.e., C-shape, H-shape, S-shape, and O-shape).Successive steps further improved prediction accuracy by using a screening cooperative anchor node strategy to increase node density and enhance the QSC-DVMFL fusion framework for fine position estimation. The proposed methodology was assessed in a series of validation, comparing it to other techniques. The results demonstrated a clear effectiveness and adaptability across a variety of factors that typically affect WSN localization.",IEEE Access,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches.

Dairy farmers implement a wide range of sensors, which create large amounts of data, in farming. Therefore, they offer an interesting area for data-driven research. In this review, we show how ML methods have already been used in the scientific literature and describe the potential that these may offer for the future. We found that ML methods were applied to predict data in a variety of areas in dairy farming such as milk yield or energy consumption; however, larger integrated datasets are required to improve the reliability of the algorithms developed. Abstract Dairy farmers use herd management systems, behavioral sensors, feeding lists, breeding schedules, and health records to document herd characteristics. Consequently, large amounts of dairy data are becoming available. However, a lack of data integration makes it difficult for farmers to analyze the data on their dairy farm, which indicates that these data are currently not being used to their full potential. Hence, multiple issues in dairy farming such as low longevity, poor performance, and health issues remain. We aimed to evaluate whether machine learning (ML) methods can solve some of these existing issues in dairy farming. This review summarizes peer-reviewed ML papers published in the dairy sector between 2015 and 2020. Ultimately, 97 papers from the subdomains of management, physiology, reproduction, behavior analysis, and feeding were considered in this review. The results confirm that ML algorithms have become common tools in most areas of dairy research, particularly to predict data. Despite the quantity of research available, most tested algorithms have not performed sufficiently for a reliable implementation in practice. This may be due to poor training data. The availability of data resources from multiple farms covering longer periods would be useful to improve prediction accuracies. In conclusion, ML is a promising tool in dairy research, which could be used to develop and improve decision support for farmers.

Especially the collection, monitoring, and evaluation of food data will have a major impact in the future on how the manufacturers will satisfy constantly growing customer demands. For this purpose, an automated system for collecting and analyzing food data was set up to promote advanced production technologies in the food industry. Based on the technique of laser triangulation, various types of food were measured three-dimensionally and examined for their chromatic composition. The raw data can be divided into individual data groups using clustering technologies. Subsequent indexing of the data in a big data architecture set the ground for setting up real-time data visualizations. The cluster-based back-end system for data processing can also be used as an organization-wide communication network for more efficient monitoring of companies’ production data flows. The results not only describe the procedure for digitization of food data, they also provide deep insights into the practical application of big data analytics while helping especially small- and medium-sized enterprises to find a good introduction to this field of research.",Machines,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Cloud service providers charge users based on the computing and storage resources used in the Cloud. In this regard, Edge Computing can be used to reduce these costs. In Edge Computing scenarios, data is pre-processed and filtered in network edge before being sent to the Cloud, resulting in shorter response times and providing a certain service level even if the link between IoT devices and Cloud is interrupted. Moreover, there is a growing trend to share physical network resources and costs through Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architectures. In this sense, and related to NFV, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are used to reconfigure the network dynamically according to the necessities during time. For this purpose, Machine Learning mechanisms, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, can be employed to manage virtual data flows in networks. In this work, we propose the evolution of an existing Edge-IoT architecture to a new improved version in which SDN/NFV are used over the Edge-IoT capabilities. The proposed new architecture contemplates the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques for the implementation of the SDN controller.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This paper presents a general overview of the initially proposed system as well as the preliminary results related to the home automation subsystem, autonomous robot navigation and mood estimation through machine learning prior to the final system integration, which will be discussed in future works. The main goal is to improve their mental well-being during their daily household activities. The system is composed of ambient intelligence with intelligent sensors, actuators and a robotic platform that interacts with the user. A test smart home system was set up in which the sensors, actuators and robotic platform were integrated and tested. For artificial intelligence applied to mood prediction, we used machine learning to classify several physiological signals into different moods. In robotics, it was concluded that the ROS autonomous navigation stack and its autodocking algorithm were not reliable enough for this task, while the robot’s autonomy was sufficient.

Part of this is due to the use of incompatible communication hardware, and part is due to the entrenched proprietary systems. This has created a heterogeneous communication landscape, where it is difficult for devices to coordinate their efforts. To remedy this, a number of IoT Frameworks have been proposed to provide a common interface between IoT devices. There are many approaches to common frameworks, each with their strengths and weaknesses, but there is no clear winner among them. This thesis presents a virtual network testbed for implementing smart home IoT Frameworks. It consists of a simulated home network made up of multiple Virtual Machines (VM), simulated smart home devices and an implementation of the OpenHAB framework to integrate the devices. Simulated devices are designed to be networkaccurate representations of actual devices, a LIFX smart lightbulb was developed and an existing Nest thermostat simulation was integrated. The demonstrated setup serves as a proof of concept for the idea of a home network testbed. Such a testbed could allow for the development of new IoT frameworks or the comparison of existing ones, and it could also serve as an education aid to illustrate how smart home IoT devices communicate with one another.

This results in the planned route not meeting the actual needs of users. In this paper, a personalized route planning algorithm is proposed, which can provide users with a route that meets their requirements. Based on the multiple properties of the road, the Polychromatic Sets (PS) theory is introduced into route planning. Firstly, a road properties description scheme based on the PS theory was proposed. By using this scheme, users’ travel preferences can be quantified, and then personalized property combination schemes can be constructed according to these properties. Secondly, the idea of setting priority for road segments was utilized. Based on a user’s travel preference, all the property combination schemes can be prioritized at relevant levels. Finally, based on the priority level, an efficient path planning scheme was proposed, in which priority is given to the highest road segments in the target direction. In addition, the system can constantly obtain real-time road information through mobile terminals, update road properties, and provide other users with more accurate road information and navigation services, so as to avoid crowded road segments without excessively increasing time consumption. Experiment results show that our algorithm can realize personalized route planning services without significantly increasing the travel time and distance.

In the recent years there have been significant advances in face recognition by using deep neural networks. One of the potential next steps is to develop optimized 3D facial recognition. Shifting from 2D to 3D increases complexity of the problem by adding an- other dimension to data, making possible solutions more resource hungry. We will investigate different depth camera based facial recognition techniques and test their performance by deploying them on an embedded processor. We focus on applications for embedded systems and use a small low-resolution time of flight (ToF) camera with our system to keep overall system portable and compact. All faces images are then projected on the feature space (“face space”) to find the corresponding coordinators. The face space is composed of “Eigenfaces” or “Fisherfaces” which are actually eigenvectors found after doing a matrix composition - Eigen decomposition. At the heart of Eigenface method is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms - while Fisherface is a better version of the previous one which makes use of both Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) to get more reliable results. The algorithms were realized by Python in Anaconda. Given initial images in the database, the program can detect and recognize the human faces in the provided pictures before saving them in the database to improve the calculation accuracy in the future.

The selected papers were first classified in three major types, namely, Practical Application, Reviews and Framework Proposal. Then, we analysed with more detail the practical application studies which were further divided into three main categories of the Gartner analytical maturity model, Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics. In particular, we characterized the distinct analytics studies in terms of the industry application and data context used, impact (in terms of their Technology Readiness Level) and selected data modelling method. Our SLR analysis provides a mapping of how data‐based Industry 4.0 expert systems are currently used, disclosing also research gaps and future research opportunities.",Expert Syst. J. Knowl.

The new trend is to utilize embedded edge devices, as they boast higher computational power and larger memories than before, to perform ML tasks that had previously been limited to cloud-hosted deployments. In this work, we assess the real-time predictability and consider data privacy concerns by comparing traditional cloud services with edge-based ones for certain data analytics tasks. We identify the subset of ML problems appropriate for edge devices by investigating if they result in real-time predictable services for a set of widely used ML libraries. We specifically enhance the Caffe library to make it more suitable for real-time predictability. We then deploy ML models with high accuracy scores on an embedded system, exposing it to industry sensor data from the field, to demonstrates its efficacy and suitability for real-time processing.",2018 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS),2018,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Thus, more research to advance in the monitoring systems used to recognize the activities of elderly people is required. Many researchers have proposed different monitoring systems for activity recognition using wired and wireless wearable sensing devices. However, the activity classification accuracy achieved so far should be improved to meet the challenges of more precise activity monitoring. Our study proposes a smart Human Activity Recognition system architecture utilizing an open source dataset generated by wireless, batteryless sensors used by 14 healthy aged persons and unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we also propose using a smart grid for checking regularly the wearable sensing device operational status to address the well-known reliability challenges of these devices, such as wireless charging and data trustworthiness. As the data from the sensing device is very noisy, we employ the K-means++ clustering to identify outliers and use advanced ensemble classification techniques, such as the stacking classifier for which a meta model built using the random forest algorithm gave better results than all other base models considered. We also employ a bagging classifier, which is an ensemble meta-estimator fitting the prediction outputs of the base classifiers and aggregating them to produce the ensemble output. The best classification accuracy of 99.81 was achieved by the stacking classifier in training and 99.78% in testing, respectively. Comparisons for finding the best model were conducted using the recall, F1 score, and precision values.",Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Among the reasons hindering the development of transplantation of anatomical materials to humans in Ukraine is the rejection of donor organs by the recipient's body. The dependences of the process of rejection of donor organs by the recipient's body on the different surface structures of cells in the recipient and donor, on the incompatibility of recipient and donor on HLA antigens, on the level of dangerous antibodies in the recipient's body, on consideration of only the waiting time for the distribution of donor organs, on the origin of the donor organ (cadaveric organ or organ from a living donor), on the general health of the recipient, on the age of the donor, on the gender of the recipient, on the recipient's disease and its phase, which required transplantation, on the chosen type of immunosuppressive therapy, and on the presence of progressive chronic dysfunction of the transplanted organ. The established dependencies are useful in the selection of donor organs in order to minimize the risk of rejection of organs by the recipient. Rules and method for supporting the decision on the possibility or undesirableness of donation and transplantation, taking into account the risks of rejection of donor organs, have been developed. The architecture of the cyber-physical system for donor organs' rejection risks prevention based on donor and recipient health monitoring is developed, aimed at verifying the existing list of factors of donor organ rejection. Based on this test, the developed cyber-physical system offers a conclusion on the possibility (if all donor organ rejection factors are eliminated or minimized) or undesirableness (if one or a group of donor organ rejection factors cannot be eliminated) of donation and transplantation in a given case.",IntelITSIS,2022,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The necessity of having an efficient, reliable, and flexible communication infrastructure is achieved by enabling real-time data exchange between numerous intelligent and traditional electrical grid elements. The performance and efficiency of the power grid are enhanced with the incorporation of communication networks, intelligent automation, advanced sensors, and information technologies. Although smart grid technologies bring about valuable economic, social, and environmental benefits, testing the combination of heterogeneous and co-existing Cyber-Physical-Smart Grids (CP-SGs) with conventional technologies presents many challenges. The examination for both hardware and software components of the Smart Grid (SG) system is essential prior to the deployment in real-time systems. This can take place by developing a prototype to mimic the real operational circumstances with adequate configurations and precision. Therefore, it is essential to summarize state-of-the-art technologies of industrial control system testbeds and evaluate new technologies and vulnerabilities with the motivation of stimulating discoveries and designs. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the advancement of CP-SGs with their corresponding testbeds including diverse testing paradigms has been performed.

The presented method can be used for the following purposes: 1) Predicting the number of taxi rides for a given location at a given time, 2) Identifying hot spots in a city, 3) Getting a rough count of the population density at a given location at a targeted hour, and 4) Planing evacuation routes for possible disasters. The presented approach has potential use for resource planning and evacuation in large cities.

While cyber sensors provide a useful tool to identify and mitigate cyber attacks, they often ignore the physical behavior of the system at hand. In this paper, we present a cyber-physical sensor called IREST (ICS Resilient Security Technology). The sensor takes a holistic approach in detecting anomalies by considering both cyber and physical disturbances in a complex system. The sensor was tested under different cyber-physical scenarios using the Idaho CPS SCADA Cybersecurity (ISAAC) testbed. The test scenarios capture different operational states of the CPS testbed, including various cyber and physical anomalies. The experiments show that the IREST sensor is able to detect both cyber and physical anomalies. The sensor has the benefit that training requires only normal data and is able to detect disturbances that have not been seen before.

In this regard, the bibliometric science mapping and content analysis of the WEF nexus scientific publication trends, the conceptual, intellectual and social structures, as well as the inherent paradigmatic shifts in the WEF nexus body of knowledge in the African continent have been undertaken, using the nexus body of literature accessed from the Web of Science and Scopus core collection databases. The review results confirmed that, whilst the WEF nexus scholarship has expanded since 2013, there is also evidence of growth in the conceptual, intellectual and social structures of the WEF nexus in the African continent. These shifts have resulted in the emergence of hot topics (subfields) including modelling and optimization, climate variability and change, environmental ecosystem services sustainability, and sustainable development and livelihoods. The review further determined that these structures have evolved along two main perspectives of WEF nexus research development, i.e., the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary domains. In support of the interpretation of the visual analytics of the intellectual structure and changing patterns of the WEF nexus research, the shifts in positivist, interpretivist and pragmatic paradigmatic perspectives (these are underpinned by the ontology, epistemology, and methodology and methods) are considered when explaining WEF nexus research shifts: (a) From the unconnected silo paradigms that focus on water, energy and food (security concerns) to interconnected (and sometimes interdependent or nested) linkages or systems incorporating environmental, social-economic and political drivers (also viewed as subfields) in a bid to holistically support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across the African continent; and (b) in the evaluation of the WEF nexus scholarship based on novel analytical approaches. We contend that whilst the theories of science change underpin this apparent expansion, the macro-economic theory will find use in explaining how the WEF nexus research agenda is negotiated and the Integrative Environmental Governance (IEG) is the duly suited governance theory to bridge the inherent disconnect between WEF nexus output and governance processes uncovered in the literature. Overall, operational challenges and opportunities of the WEF nexus abound, transitioning the WEF nexus research to practice in Africa, motivating the need to take advantage of the scholar–practitioner research underpinnings, as contemplated in the transdisciplinary research approach, which is characterised by the dual quest for new knowledge and considerations of use. Yet, there is need for more coordinated and collaborative research to achieve impact and transition from WEF nexus thinking to WEF nexus practice.",,2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Our framework is data driven and can easily be applied to any location with suitable historical observations. This will enable site-specific studies that are needed for rigorous risk assessments and climate adaptation planning. The framework combines a physics-based model of crop yield with stochastic process models for meteorological inputs. Combined with techniques from uncertainty quantification, global sensitivity analysis, and machine learning, this hybrid statistical–physical framework allows studying the potential impacts of meteorological uncertainty on future agricultural yields and identify the environmental variables that contribute the most to prediction uncertainty. To highlight the utility of our general approach, we studied the predicted yields of multiple crops in multiple scenarios constructed from historical data.

Western African countries are highly dependent on biomass resources; therefore, understanding the potential of bioenergy from crop residues is crucial to designing effective land-management practices. The assessment of the capability to use crop residues for electricity production is particularly important in those regions where agriculture is the dominant productive sector and where electrification through grid extension might be challenging. The objective of this work was to guide the development of sustainable strategies for rural areas that support energy development by simultaneously favouring food self-sufficiency capacity and environmental benefits. These complex interlinkages have been jointly assessed in the Senegal river basin by an integrated optimization system using a cropland–energy–water-environment nexus approach. The use of the nexus approach, which integrates various environmental factors, is instrumental to identify optimal land-energy strategies and provide decision makers with greater knowledge of the potential multiple benefits while minimizing trade-offs of the new solutions such as those connected to farmers’ needs, local energy demand, and food and land aspects. By a context-specific analysis, we estimated that, in 2016, 7 million tons of crop residues were generated, resulting in an electricity potential of 4.4 million MWh/year. Several sustainable land-energy management strategies were explored and compared with the current management strategy. Our results indicate that bioenergy production from crop residues can increase with significant variability from 5% to +50% depending on the strategy constraints considered. An example analysis of alternative irrigation in the Guinea region clearly illustrates the existing conflict between water, energy, and food: strategies optimizing bioenergy achieved increases both for energy and food production (+6%) but at the expense of increasing water demand by a factor of nine.

The analysis of this big data enables farmers, companies and agronomists to extract high business and scientific knowledge, improving their operational processes and product quality. However, before analysing this data, different data sources need to be normalised, homogenised and integrated into a unified data representation. In this paper, we propose an agricultural data integration method using a constellation schema which is designed to be flexible enough to incorporate other datasets and big data models. We also apply some methods to extract knowledge with the view to improve crop yield; these include finding suitable quantities of soil properties, herbicides and insecticides for both increasing crop yield and protecting the environment.",ICMLSC,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

The introduction of modern information and communication technologies for collecting and processing Agricultural data revolutionise the agriculture practises. This has started a while ago (early 20th century) and it is driven by the low cost of collecting data about everything; from information on fields such as seed, soil, fertiliser, pest, to weather data, drones and satellites images. Specially, the agricultural data mining today is considered as Big Data application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Hence it leads to challenges in processing vast amounts of complex and diverse information to extract useful knowledge for the farmer, agronomist, and other businesses. It is a key foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable efficient resource management and high quality agronomy decision making and recommendations. In this paper, we designed and implemented a continental level agricultural data warehouse (ADW). ADW is characterised by its (1) flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets; (3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5) high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) consistency, availability and partition tolerant; (9) cloud compatibility. We also evaluate the performance of ADW and present some complex queries to extract and return necessary knowledge about crop management.",Int. J. Bus. Process. Integr.

The purpose of this study is to develop a decision support system (DSS) that would serve as an analytical and advisory tool for conducting complex research at the stages of pre‐project preparation and design of irrigation systems. The leading approach underlying the solution of the subject matter is the functional modelling methodology integration definition for function modelling (IDEFo). This article presents the architecture of the software product, which shows the main subsystems of the DSS and reflects their interrelations. The implementation of the DSS in the form of a software product based on the provisions of the recommendations will automate the process of selecting alternatives (analogues) for elements of irrigation systems in specific conditions and provide information support for decision‐making at the stages of pre‐design studies and design, and also increase quality control and improve efficiency of managerial decision‐making by 10–15% and reduce the total cost of organizing pre‐design studies and designing irrigation systems by 3–5%. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Irrigation and Drainage,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Through the use of Social Network Analysis (SNA), the literature on urban agriculture was analyzed, detecting eight key trends and topic areas. This information was used to design a generic recursive organizational structure with the identification of the key roles and functions for management and governance in the multi-level and multi-stakeholder relationships of a sustainable urban self-sufficient food production system, inspired by the principles of complexity management and organizational cybernetics. Methodologically, this is the first application that combines the exploratory capability of SNA and the recursive structure of the Viable System Model (VSM) to propose applicable organizational structures in any urban area, suggesting a new route for the study and application of systemic thinking in the development of urban agriculture schemes. However, due to the conceptual nature of this work, this study opens a discussion on how we can rethink interactions to seek continuous adaptation in food self-sufficiency, provide tools that foster inclusion, and adapt to every context to support the relevant actors and academics in urban agriculture.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Motivation: Agricultural production is performed on an agricultural land, which has to be exploited in the best possible way, given the increasing human population and the limited availability of the land. Considering the importance of this issue, a large number of research studies dealing with problems in agriculture can be found in the literature, and many of these problems are solved by OR methods and techniques. However, to our knowledge, there are no review papers that deal with this specific area, so the main motivation is to provide a detailed review of selected OR methods application in the agricultural land processing area. Idea: The core idea behind this research is to perceive a real impact of OR methods and techniques implementation in the agricultural land processing. The research is based on detailed literature review for the period 2014-2019 and performed statistics involving publication by year, publication by journal and statistics involving keywords in articles. Data: The review was conducted using online repositories of the papers published in SCI and SCIe journals with impact factors in the period from 2014-2019. Tools: Analyzed papers are divided into three groups according to the OR method applied: linear optimization problems, DEA method and other OR methods (non linear, multicriteria, mixed integer programming, dynamic programming). Papers within the groups are analyzed according to the type of problems solved. Statistical analyses of all collected data were used to get a good insight into the applications of operations research problems and data envelopment analysis in agricultural land processing. Findings: The number of published papers in this specific area has a growing trend over the observed years (with some minor decrease in 2016 and 2019 in comparison with the previous year). All of the articles are related to specific application of the given methods to solving problems in the agricultural land processing, and this is the reason for many different keywords appearing in the articles. Some very important keywords such as “operations research” or “OR” does not appear in any article as a keyword. Inclusion of such common keywords may result in a faster search in repositories of all articles. Contribution: The primary contribution of this paper is a detailed review of application of linear optimization, data envelopment analysis and other OR methods in agricultural land processing in the period 2014-2019.",,2020,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

This study proposed an optimization programming framework for improving water-use efficiency from a WEF nexus perspective. Through the incorporation of water rights transfer mechanism, water resources can be flexibly allocated between food and energy sectors. The proposed model could help decision makers to identify the optimal production scales of food and energy production, the potential of water conservation of food production, as well as the investment portfolio of water-saving engineering. The capability of proposed model was illustrated through a case study in Yellow River Basin, north China. Based on the proposed optimization model, the optimal allocation scheme of water resources between food and energy sectors were obtained. A total of 2.34 × 107 m3 of water would be transferred from food production to energy sector. Compared with state quo, production scales of energy sector, as well as profits of both food and energy sectors would increase rapidly. Optimization results reveal that designed energy production scales proposed by local government and enterprises are attainable as long as there are sufficient water resources available for energy sector.",IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Despite the widespread popularity of nexus thinking, it still lacks standardized procedures and methodologies to assist in its development. Therefore, this paper proposes, from a literature review, a systematic procedure to assist in the development of management models based on nexus thinking. To this end, 304 papers were analyzed using the following criteria: nexus concept, type of approach, geographic scale, elements in the nexus system, application context, and types of assessment methods and tools. The results of the review served as the basis for determining the procedure, which consisted of four steps: (a) understanding nexus thinking, (b) identification of composing variables, (c) evaluation (diagnosis and prognosis), and (d) decision-making. In addition to the standardization of these steps, the main information used to compose the procedure was organized and synthesized with a mind map.",,2019,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

Its etiology is multifaceted, and the specific pathophysiological mechanisms are still unclear. At present, the main treatment methods for depression are medication, psychotherapy and physical therapy, and clinical applications usually combine two or three methods. Psychotherapy is currently mainly oriented towards the traditional face-to-face communication with psychologists, and is rarely combined with the current rapid development of technology. In this paper, we aim to design an intelligent robot that incorporates deep learning methods to help doctors treat patients more efficiently. The problem is that the current models of robots are trained by uploading data to a server, and then having the server train the robot. There are disadvantages of this approach. First, patient videos and conversations are private information. So uploading those private information to the server can lead to patient information leakage, which is bad. Second, the data recorded in daily life, including audio and video, are very large files that are slow to transfer and tend to cause package loss and other problems in the process. Training a multi-robot model in combination with federal learning would be a good solution to these two problems. The article combines federal learning with basic deep learning methods to design a depression treatment robot(DTbot) that can treat patients with more privacy and efficiency while handling their personal information.",2021 IEEE 13th International Conference on Computer Research and Development (ICCRD),2021,semantic_scholar,citation,citation

In contrast, it is common for each client to own data that represents only a single demographic group. Hence the existing approaches cannot be adopted for fair classification models at the client level. To resolve this challenge, we propose several aggregation techniques.

Despite the large body of research works already reported, current key technological challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy. Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD robotic learning is introduced in this paper, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) (and especially the Deep Learning (DL)) field, by establishing a Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes (implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled learning methodologies for modelling the multi-level inter-dependencies among the robotic tasks.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart industry.

To achieve that, this paper discusses tools and requirements for FL implementation towards a model for real-time traffic estimation, as well as how such solution could be evaluated using VANET and network simulators.
