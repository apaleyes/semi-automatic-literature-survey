Despite recent academic advances in the field, we observe that simple methods such as best-seller lists dominate deployed recommendation engines in e-commerce. We find our empirical findings to be well-aligned with those of the survey, where in both cases simple personalized recommenders achieve higher ranking than more advanced techniques. We also compare the traditional random evaluation protocol to our proposed chronological sampling method, which can be used for determining the optimal time-span of the training history for optimizing the performance of algorithms.

10.1109/ICDE.2019.00205,FAIR: Fraud Aware Impression Regulation System in Large-Scale Real-Time E-Commerce Search Platform,IEEE,Conferences,"Fraud sellers in e-commerce usually promote their products via fake transactions. Such behaviors damage the reputation of the e-commerce platform and jeopardize the business environment in the platform. The search engine of existing e-commerce platforms mainly focuses on generating transactions by matching users' queries and sellers' products. The most common method to defense fraud sellers is to set up a blacklist based on fraud detection and manual investigation, and then punish those sellers in the list, which is inefficient and can only cover a small fraction of potential fraud sellers. In this paper, we propose the first fraud aware impression regulation system (FAIR) which is data-driven and can work in large-scale e-commerce platforms. Its main function is to actively regulate the impressions received by all potential fraud sellers in a real-time fashion. It utilizes the reinforcement learning architecture to dynamically adjust the impression regulation strategy under different reward settings, which can not only promote the impression regulation effects, but also improve the revenue of the platform simultaneously. We deploy FAIR on the Taobao platform of Alibaba, one of the world's largest e-commerce search platform, and perform an A/B test for two weeks. The results show that FAIR can effectively reduce the fraud impressions and improve the overall platform revenue at the same time.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8731598/,2019 IEEE 35th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),8-11 April 2019,ieeexplore
10.1109/ICDE48307.2020.00149,Hierarchical Bipartite Graph Neural Networks: Towards Large-Scale E-commerce Applications,IEEE,Conferences,"The e-commerce appeals to a multitude of online shoppers by providing personalized experiences and becomes indispensable in our daily life. Accurately predicting user preference and making a recommendation of favorable items plays a crucial role in improving several key tasks such as Click Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) in order to increase commercial value. Some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods exploiting non-linear interactions on a user-item bipartite graph are able to learn better user and item representations with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs because they are inherently flat. Hierarchical representation is reportedly favorable in making more personalized item recommendations in terms of behaviorally similar users in the same community and a context of topic-driven taxonomy. However, some advanced approaches, in this regard, are either only considering linear interactions, or adopting single-level community, or computationally expensive. To address these problems, we propose a novel method with Hierarchical bipartite Graph Neural Network (HiGNN) to handle large-scale e-commerce tasks. By stacking multiple GNN modules and using a deterministic clustering algorithm alternately, HiGNN is able to efficiently obtain hierarchical user and item embeddings simultaneously, and effectively predict user preferences on a larger scale. Extensive experiments on some real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that HiGNN achieves a significant improvement compared to several popular methods. Moreover, we deploy HiGNN in Taobao, one of the largest e-commerces with hundreds of million users and items, for a series of large-scale prediction tasks of item recommendations. The results also illustrate that HiGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9101846/,2020 IEEE 36th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),20-24 April 2020,ieeexplore

It is quite straightforward to write machine learning codes these days but they are not designed to be deployed in production scale where millions of requests per day is a norm. In this paper, we describe our implementation of a ML service for large scale product tagging in e-commerce called Protagoras. The problem of tagging products can be seen as multi-label classification where the labels are product tags. By performing the classification within each product category, the precision can be increased and the inference can be performed faster. Protagoras combined the scalability and speed of microservice implementation in Golang and robust machine learning implementation in Python. We present the architecture of the system with all its components including API endpoints, job queue, database, and monitoring.

Brand Entity Normalization becomes a research issue to recognize labels under a certain brand. The former methods focus on dictionary based text matching. However, it is unpractical to define matching rules in an effective way. This paper proposes a brand entity normalization algorithm integrating text similarity and commodity object similarity. Firstly, the text similarity of brand labels is computed to generate candidate brand entity set.

The motivation of this adaptation is to facilitate the use of ART principles in real distributed applications instead of a centralized testbed for experimentation. This paper presents an adaptation of the protocols proposed by ART testbed to a codification for the most popular agent platform: JADE.

10.1109/ICAC.2017.47,A Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for the Generation and Evolution of Adaptation Rules,IEEE,Conferences,"One of the challenges in self-adaptive systems concerns how to make adaptation to themselves at runtime in response to possible and even unexpected changes from the environment and/or user goals. A feasible solution to this challenge is rule-based adaptation, in which, adaptation decisions are made according to predefined rules that specify what particular actions should be performed to react to different changing events from the environment. Although it has the characteristic of highly- efficient decision making for adaptation, rule-based adaptation has two limitations: 1. no guarantee that those predefined rules will lead to optimal or nearly-optimal adaptation results; 2. weak support to evolve these rules to cope with non-stationary environment and changeable user goals at runtime. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework to the generation and evolution of software adaptation rules. This framework manifests two key capabilities for self-adaptation: 1. the capability of automatically learning adaptation rules from different goal settings at the offline phase; 2. the capability of automatically evolving adaptation rules from real-time information about the environment and user goals at the online phase. The two capabilities are built on the combination of reinforcement learning and case-based reasoning techniques. This framework improves the existing rule-based adaptation from two points: the flexibility of adaptation logic, and the quality of adaptation rules. We evaluate this framework through a case study of an E-commerce web application, which shows that this framework improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of self-adaptation.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8005338/,2017 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC),17-21 July 2017,ieeexplore

However, analyzing huge amount of data manually is not possible in time context of business. Therefore, automated sentimental analysis, which can automatically determine the sentiments from the text data corpus plays an important role in today's world. Many sentimental analysis frameworks with state of the art results have been proposed in the literature. However, many of these frameworks have low accuracy on the textual data corpus contains emoticons and special texts. In addition, many of these frameworks are also energy and computation intensive with which puts limitation in their real time deployment. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by proposing a novel sentimental analysis framework based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed framework uses a novel technique to tokenize the text documents, wherein stop words, special characters, emoticons present in the text documents are eliminated. In addition, words with similar meanings and annotations are clubbed together into one type, using the concept of stemming. The pre-processed tokenized documents are then vectorized into n-gram integers vectors using the ‘TfidfVectorizer’ for use as input to the SVM based machine learning classifier model.

10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00095,AS-GCN: Adaptive Semantic Architecture of Graph Convolutional Networks for Text-Rich Networks,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power in many network analytical tasks. However, graphs (i.e., networks) in the real world are usually text-rich, implying that valuable semantic information needs to be carefully considered. Existing GNNs for text-rich networks typically treat text as attribute words alone, which inevitably leads to the loss of important semantic structures, limiting the representation capability of GNNs. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end adaptive semantic architecture of graph convolutional networks, namely AS-GCN, which unifies neural topic model and graph convolutional networks, for text-rich network representation. Specifically, we utilize a neural topic model to extract the global topic semantics, and accordingly augment the original text-rich network into a tri-typed heterogeneous network, capturing both the local word-sequence semantic structure and the global topic semantic structure from text. We then design an effective semantic-aware propagation of information by introducing a discriminative convolution mechanism. We further propose two strategies, that is, distribution sharing and joint training, to adaptively generate a proper network structure based on the learning objective to improve network representation. Extensive experiments on text-rich networks illustrate that our new architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant improvement. Meanwhile, this architecture can also be applied to e-commerce search scenes, and experiments on a real e-commerce problem from JD further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture over the baselines.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679149/,2021 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),7-10 Dec. 2021,ieeexplore

In this paper we present a new approach of instance-based matching building on the hypothesis that the corresponding attributes have equal relative importance. The framework of our approach consists of three parts: attribute ranking, attribute classification and matching phase. Unlike traditional approaches considering all attributes with the same importance, we take machine learning methods to prioritize all schema attributes by ranking and classification. During the matching phase, we construct an optimal objective function to find all equivalent attributes. In the end, our approach is validated by real datasets and the results show good accuracy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5360566/,2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery,14-16 Aug. 2009,ieeexplore

Semantic query, as an application of semantic Web, has shown significant potential in improving the performance of IR. However, many current semantic query engines focus only on the ontology query, while in real world lots of data is stored in heterogeneous relational databases, not ontologies. So how to use semantic query to search the real information in databases has become an issue. In this paper, we explore a novel semantic search approach based on ontology, which uses SPARQL to query the Global Ontology, and realizes the final search of information in the heterogeneous relational databases through a series of query rewrite. A prototype system named 'OSEQ' has been implemented in light of this approach.

10.1109/INTECH.2017.8102442,An empirical study on detecting fake reviews using machine learning techniques,IEEE,Conferences,"Reputation systems in E-commerce (EC) play a substantial role that allows various parties to achieve mutual benefits by establishing relationships. The reputation systems aim at helping consumers in deciding whether to negotiate with a given party. Many factors negatively influence the sight of the customers and the vendors in terms of the reputation system. For instance, lack of honesty or effort in providing the feedback reviews, by which users might create phantom feedback from fake reviews to support their reputation. Moreover, the opinions obtained from users can be classified into positive or negative which can be used by a consumer to select a product. In this paper, we study online movie reviews using Sentiment Analysis (SA) methods in order to detect fake reviews. Text classification and SA methods are applied on a real conducted dataset of movie reviews. Specifically, we compare four supervised machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN-IBK), and Decision Tree (DT-J48) for sentiment classification of reviews in two different situations without stopwords and with stopwords methods are employed.

Such behaviors damage the reputation of the e-commerce platform and jeopardize the business environment in the platform. The search engine of existing e-commerce platforms mainly focuses on generating transactions by matching users' queries and sellers' products. The most common method to defense fraud sellers is to set up a blacklist based on fraud detection and manual investigation, and then punish those sellers in the list, which is inefficient and can only cover a small fraction of potential fraud sellers.

Accurately predicting user preference and making a recommendation of favorable items plays a crucial role in improving several key tasks such as Click Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) in order to increase commercial value. Some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods exploiting non-linear interactions on a user-item bipartite graph are able to learn better user and item representations with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs because they are inherently flat. Hierarchical representation is reportedly favorable in making more personalized item recommendations in terms of behaviorally similar users in the same community and a context of topic-driven taxonomy. However, some advanced approaches, in this regard, are either only considering linear interactions, or adopting single-level community, or computationally expensive. To address these problems, we propose a novel method with Hierarchical bipartite Graph Neural Network (HiGNN) to handle large-scale e-commerce tasks. By stacking multiple GNN modules and using a deterministic clustering algorithm alternately, HiGNN is able to efficiently obtain hierarchical user and item embeddings simultaneously, and effectively predict user preferences on a larger scale. Extensive experiments on some real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that HiGNN achieves a significant improvement compared to several popular methods.

Stream-computing is a new computing paradigm for handling the velocity attribute of bigdata which makes it possible to develop real time bigdata applications. This paper gives the details of implementation of a real time recommendation system using Apache Spark, a widely used platform for stream computing.

10.1109/ECAI.2018.8679045,Intelligent Conversational Agent for Online Sales,IEEE,Conferences,"A conversational agent is one of emerging technologies that will take place in several of life domains, including e-commerce. The common features of any conversational agent in any domain is its ability to have a dialog with a human user and 24/7 available. Thus, including a conversational agent in an online business will give benefits not only to online retailers, but also e-customers. However, a conversational agent for online sales may have a different feature than a conversational agent in other domain such as health care. The main task of a conversational agent in an online sales domain is to engage and persuade e-commerce customers to buy a product. In a real life, persuasion is considered as an abstract process, which only can be achieved through a series of dialogs. In a virtual world, a conversational agent for online sales is considered intelligent if it is able to demonstrate this feature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to demonstrate persuasion feature through recommendation and negotiation dialogs to meet e-customers' needs. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented and preliminary results indicate the proposed method is successful.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8679045/,"2018 10th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)",28-30 June 2018,ieeexplore

The rate that data is being generated is exploding across multiple domains, including medical research, environmental science, web-search, and e-commerce. Many of these advances have benefited from emergent web-based applications, and improvements in data storage and sensing technologies. Innovations in parallel accelerator hardware, such as GPUs, has made it possible to process massive amounts of data in a timely fashion. Given these advanced data acquisition technology and hardware, machine learning researchers are equipped to generate and sift through much larger and complex datasets quickly. In this work, we focus on accelerating Kernel Dimension Alternative Clustering algorithms using GPUs. We conduct a thorough performance analysis by using both synthetic and real-world datasets, while also modifying both the structure of the data, and the size of the datasets.

But the recommendations from these systems do not change on inputs beyond user and item profile and transaction data. There have been some attempts in the past to optimize on more varied data in recommenders, example of which is the location based recommenders. But location is just one dimension of the state that a user could have shared with GPS/GLONASS/BaiDeu sensor available in most Smartphones. With an upcoming era of Smart-wears and pervasive IoTs, there are a lot many other dimensions of a user state which can be utilized to optimize upon the concept of Optimal State Recommender Solutions. This paper suggests upgrading from conventional recommendations that are based on user/ item preferences alone with systems that provide the best recommendation at the most optimal state when the user is most receptive to accept the recommendation, the “optimal state recommendation solution” and proposes solutions and architectures to overcome the challenges of dealing with real time, distributed machine learning on IoT scale data in implementing this solution. The paper leverages some of the advance distributed machine learning algorithms like variants of Distributed Kalman Filters, Distributed Alternating Least Square Recommenders, Distributed Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based Classifiers, and highly scalable distributed computation and machine learning platforms like Apache Spark, (Apache) Spark MLlib, Spark Streaming, Python/PySpark, R/SparkR, Apache Kafka in an high performance, distributed, fault tolerant architecture.

There is solid evidence that the vast majority of such malicious bot traffic comes from data centers. The malicious bot deployed on the hosts of data centers is referred to as a CloudBot. How to detect and block CloudBots effectively has become an urgent problem in practice, while the research on it can be seldom seen in public. To this end, we propose a traffic-based quasi-real-time method for CloudBot detection using machine learning, which exploits a new sample partitioning approach, as well as innovative multi-layer features that reveal the essential difference between CloudBots and human traffic. Our method achieves 93.4% precision in the experiment and performs well on the real-world dataset, which proves to be effective to detect unknown CloudBots and combat the concept drift caused by varying time.

Relevant, dynamic and smart item recommendations play a significant role in providing quality user experience. The majority of existing work either relies on explicit user feedback or gives static recommendations that poorly adapt to the changing user preferences. This paper proposes novel model architectures, namely, Sequential Feature Bandits(SFB) and Cross Feature Bandits(CFB) for providing online top-k context-aware recommendations. It leverages the item features, and uses implicit user feedback with a reinforcement learning backed dynamic algorithm. We use deep-q learning to maximize the cumulative estimated reward(CMR) and click-through rate(CTR) along with an experience replay strategy to prevent the proposed models from getting destabilized.

While previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain candidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains under-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against deep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the relative order among a selected set of candidates according to an attacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated candidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an inequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct optimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack scenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a Short-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box Order Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box and black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully implemented on a major e-commerce platform.

Illegitimate subscription services, counterfeit goods and fake-shops cause consistent and enormous financial damage. Manual preventive measures fall short due to the sheer number and increasing volume of cases reported for evaluation. Reducing the window of opportunity and increasing the efficiency in flagging fake-shops is therefore key. This paper presents an approach to classify fraudulent online shops solely on the basis of the similarity of their source code structure using machine learning processes. The trained models show an Accuracy of up to 97% and a very high degree of certainty in classifying fraudulent e-commerce, with 61% of all absolute prediction values being nearly identical to the ones made by human experts. Additionally, an aggregated model was developed that plays an important factor in balancing the overall quality of predictions. The open source software components developed include the Fake-Shop Detection API and Middleware, which enables a risk assessment of any website based on the trained models. By using the developed models, the system was able to issue warnings for 48% of fake-shops at the highest prediction confidence level, meaning that these could have immediately been blacklisted by consumer protection agencies, without a single false-classification and an error rate of zero.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9378204/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),10-13 Dec. 2020,ieeexplore

Extracting valid attributes from the query forms and automatic translating the source query into a target query is a solvable way for addressing the current limitations in accessing Deep Web data sources. To generate a valid query, we have to reconcile the key attributes and their semantic relation. We present our framework to solve the problem.

10.1109/SCC.2016.75,UCLAO* and BHUC: Two Novel Planning Algorithms for Uncertain Web Service Composition,IEEE,Conferences,"The inherent uncertainty of Web service is the most important characteristic due to its deployment and invocation within a real and highly dynamic Internet environment. Web service composition with uncertainty (U-WSC) has become an important research issue in service computing. Although some research has been done on U-WSC via non-deterministic planning in Artificial Intelligence, they cannot handle the situation that uncertain Web services with the same functionality exist in a service repository and could not get all of possible solution plans that constitute an uncertain composition solution for a given request. To solve above research challenges, this paper models a U-WSC problem into a U-WSC planning problem. Accordingly, two novel uncertain planning algorithms using heuristic search called UCLAO* and BHUC, are presented to solve the U-WSC planning problem with state space reduction, which leads to high efficiency of finding a service composition solution. We have conducted empirical experiments based on a running example in e-commerce application as well as our large-scale simulated datasets.

When more orders need to be processed simultaneously, some existing task scheduling methods may not be able to give a suitable plan, which delays order processing and reduces the efficiency of the warehouse. Therefore, the intelligent warehouse system that uses autonomous robots for automated storage and intelligent order scheduling is becoming mainstream. Based on this concept, we propose a multi-robot cooperative scheduling system in the intelligent warehouse. The aim of the multi-robot cooperative scheduling system of the intelligent storage is to drive many robots in an intelligent warehouse to perform the distributed tasks in an optimal (e.g., time-saving and energy-conserved) way. In this paper, we propose a multi-robot cooperative task scheduling model in the intelligent warehouse. For this model, we design a maximin-based multi-objective algorithm, which uses a one-by-one update scheme to select individuals. In this algorithm, two indicators are devised to discriminate the equivalent individuals with the same maximin fitness value in the environmental selection process. The results on benchmark test suite show that our algorithm is indeed a useful optimizer. Then it is applied to settle the multi-robot scheduling problem in the intelligence warehouse.

A successful online behavior recommendation system should have the ability to predict behaviors that users used to performs and also suggest behaviors that users never performed before. In this paper, we develop a mixture model that contains two components to address this problem. The first component is the user-specific preference component that represents the habits of users based on their behavior history. The second component is the latent group preference component based on variational autoencoder, a deep generative neural network. This component corresponds to the hidden interests of users and allows us to discover the unseen behavior of users. We conduct experiments on various real-world datasets with different characteristics to show the performance of our model in different situations.

Under the big data environment, machine learning methods have been applied in the domain of e-commerce of physical goods to improve the traditional reputation evaluation methods, and achieved good results. However, few studies have applied machine learning methods to crowdsourcing, a form of service e-commerce, to evaluate the reputation of participants. This paper proposes a reputation evaluation model (i.e. LDA-RF) for crowdsourcing participants of Random Forest based on Linear Discriminant Analysis. The model consists of five steps: firstly, building a multidimensional reputation evaluation index system for crowdsourcing participants, collecting real data sets, and preprocessing data; secondly, data dimensionality reduction methods, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Mean Impact Value method and ReliefF feature selection method, are used to eliminate redundant variables; thirdly, data normalization; fourthly, with selected feature subset, five machine learning techniques, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Back propagation Neural Network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are used to train the model; Fifthly, the validity of the model is tested by four evaluation measures: 10 fold cross validation, confusion matrix, Kruskal-wallis test and dispersion degree.

The features presently supported by browsers have raised business opportunities, by supplying high interactivity in web-based services, like web banking, e-commerce, social networking, forums, and at the same time, these features have brought serious risks and increased vulnerabilities in web applications that enable cyber-attacks to be executed. One of the common high-risk cyber-attack of web application vulnerabilities is cross-site scripting (XSS). Nowadays, XSS is still dramatically increasing and considered as one of the most severe threats for organizations, users, and developers. If the ploy is successful, the victim is at the mercy of the cybercriminals. In this research, a robust artificial neural network-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) scheme integrated with the dynamic feature extractor is proposed for XSS attack detection. The detection scheme adopts a large real-world dataset, the dynamic features extraction mechanism, and MLP model, which successfully surpassed several tests on an employed unique dataset under careful experimentation, and achieved promising and state-of-the-art results with accuracy, detection probabilities, false positive rate, and AUC-ROC scores of 99.32%, 98.35 %, 0.3%, and 99.02%, respectively.

As a result, there has been a spike in credit card fraud that affects card issuing companies, merchants, and banks. It is therefore essential to develop mechanisms that ensure the security and integrity of credit card transactions. In this research, we implement a machine learning (ML) based framework for credit card fraud detection using a real world imbalanced datasets that were generated from European credit cardholders. To solve the issue of class imbalance, we re-sampled the dataset using the Synthetic Minority over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE). This framework was evaluated using the following ML methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Decision Tree (DT), and Extra Tree (ET). These ML algorithms were coupled with the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) technique to increase their quality of classification. The models were evaluated using the accuracy, the recall, the precision, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Moreover, the proposed framework was implemented on a highly skewed synthetic credit card fraud dataset to further validate the results that were obtained in this research. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that using the AdaBoost has a positive impact on the performance of the proposed methods. Further, the results obtained by the boosted models were superior to existing methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9651991/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore

One of the major challenges that largely remains open is the cold-start problem, which can be viewed as a barrier that keeps the cold-start users/items away from the existing ones. In this paper, we aim to break through this barrier for cold-start users/items by the assistance of existing ones. In particular, inspired by the classic Elo Rating System, which has been widely adopted in chess tournaments, we propose a novel rating comparison strategy (RAPARE) to learn the latent profiles of cold-start users/items. The centerpiece of our RAPARE is to provide a fine-grained calibration on the latent profiles of cold-start users/items by exploring the differences between cold-start and existing users/items. As a generic strategy, our proposed strategy can be instantiated into existing methods in recommender systems. To reveal the capability of RAPARE strategy, we instantiate our strategy on two prevalent methods in recommender systems, i.e., the matrix factorization based and neighborhood based collaborative filtering.

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104472,Transfer Learning Strategies for Credit Card Fraud Detection,IEEE,Journals,"Credit card fraud jeopardizes the trust of customers in e-commerce transactions. This led in recent years to major advances in the design of automatic Fraud Detection Systems (FDS) able to detect fraudulent transactions with short reaction time and high precision. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous nature of the fraud behavior makes it difficult to tailor existing systems to different contexts (e.g. new payment systems, different countries and/or population segments). Given the high cost (research, prototype development, and implementation in production) of designing data-driven FDSs, it is crucial for transactional companies to define procedures able to adapt existing pipelines to new challenges. From an AI/machine learning perspective, this is known as the problem of <i>transfer learning</i>. This paper discusses the design and implementation of transfer learning approaches for e-commerce credit card fraud detection and their assessment in a real setting. The case study, based on a six-month dataset (more than 200 million e-commerce transactions) provided by the industrial partner, relates to the transfer of detection models developed for a European country to another country. In particular, we present and discuss 15 transfer learning techniques (ranging from naive baselines to state-of-the-art and new approaches), making a critical and quantitative comparison in terms of precision for different transfer scenarios. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we show that the accuracy of many transfer methods is strongly dependent on the number of labeled samples in the target domain and (ii) we propose an ensemble solution to this problem based on self-supervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation classifiers. The thorough experimental assessment shows that this solution is both highly accurate and hardly sensitive to the number of labeled samples.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9512084/,IEEE Access,2021,ieeexplore
10.1109/TCYB.2019.2927410,Transforming Cooling Optimization for Green Data Center via Deep Reinforcement Learning,IEEE,Journals,"Data center (DC) plays an important role to support services, such as e-commerce and cloud computing. The resulting energy consumption from this growing market has drawn significant attention, and noticeably almost half of the energy cost is used to cool the DC to a particular temperature. It is thus an critical operational challenge to curb the cooling energy cost without sacrificing the thermal safety of a DC. The existing solutions typically follow a two-step approach, in which the system is first modeled based on expert knowledge and, thus, the operational actions are determined with heuristics and/or best practices. These approaches are often hard to generalize and might result in suboptimal performances due to intrinsic model errors for large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose optimizing the DC cooling control via the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Compared to the existing approaches, our solution lends itself an end-to-end cooling control algorithm (CCA) via an off-policy offline version of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, in which an evaluation network is trained to predict the DC energy cost along with resulting cooling effects, and a policy network is trained to gauge optimized control settings. Moreover, we introduce a de-underestimation (DUE) validation mechanism for the critic network to reduce the potential underestimation of the risk caused by neural approximation. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on an EnergyPlus simulation platform and on a real data trace collected from the National Super Computing Centre (NSCC) of Singapore. The resulting numerical results show that the proposed CCA can achieve up to 11% cooling cost reduction on the simulation platform compared with a manually configured baseline control algorithm. In the trace-based study of conservative nature, the proposed algorithm can achieve about 15% cooling energy savings on the NSCC data trace. Our pioneering approach can shed new light on the application of DRL to optimize and automate DC operations and management, potentially revolutionizing digital infrastructure management with intelligence.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8772127/,IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,May 2020,ieeexplore

Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method can seek the tradeoff, where both channel resources and customers' satisfaction are optimal.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8784156/,IEEE Access,2019,ieeexplore

To address this problem, we study a new cloud-based architecture that provides Platform-asa-Service (PaaS) management capabilities to the manufacturing community for delivering Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “Apps” to their customers. Our architecture aims at supporting an “App Marketplace” that thrives on agile development, organic collaboration and scalable sales of next generation manufacturing Apps requiring high-performance simulation and modeling. Towards realizing the vision of the above architecture, our paper involves investigation and implementation of an Ontology Service that interoperates with other common web services related to resource brokering and accounting. Our Ontology Service uses principles of mapping and merging to translate a manufacturing App's collaboration requirements to suitable resource specifications on public cloud platforms. Integrated resultant ontology can be queried to provision the required resource parameters such as amount of memory/storage, number of processing units, and network protocol configurations needed for deployment of an App. We validate the effectiveness of our Ontology Service using the Protégé framework in a pilot testbed of a real-world “WheelSim” App in the NSF GENI Cloud platform.

Since many e-commerce retailers sell items from other third-party marketplace sellers besides their own, the content published by both internal and external content creators needs to be monitored and enriched, wherever possible. Despite guidelines and warnings, product listings that contain offensive and non-compliant images continue to enter catalogs. Offensive and non-compliant content can include a wide range of objects, logos, and banners conveying violent, sexually explicit, racist, or promotional messages. Such images can severely damage the customer experience, lead to legal issues, and erode the company brand. In this paper, we present a computer vision driven offensive and non-compliant image detection system for extremely large image datasets.

Traditional personalization techniques such as collaborative filtering and rule-based method have many drawbacks, including lack of scalability, reliance on subjective user rating or static profiles, and the inability to capture a richer set of semantic relationships among objects. In this paper, we present a new approach by building customer profiles based on the product hierarchy for more effective personalization in electronic commerce. We divide each customer profile into three parts: the basic profile, preference profile, and rule profile. Based on the customer profiles, two kinds of recommendations can be generated: interest recommendation and association recommendation. We also propose a special data structure: a profile tree for effective searching and matching.

10.1109/EIDWT.2011.15,A Relational Recommender System Based on Domain Ontology,IEEE,Conferences,"Product recommendation on electronic commerce Web sites becomes more important with the widespread use of Internet-based shopping. Collaborative filtering and content based filtering methods have been commonly used for this task by electronic commerce Web sites. These methods have several shortcomings, such as cold start problem, biased ratings problem or inaccurate recommendations. In order to produce effective and accurate recommendations, recent approaches utilize the semantic properties of data by integrating the domain ontology into the recommendation process. In these studies, the domain ontology covering only the types and properties of the product to be recommended is considered where the relational nature of the product data is omitted. However, the domain ontology of the features related to the product may also provide useful information during recommendation process. In this study, we focus on integrating the domain ontology of relational data into the recommendation process. We design a framework for an easy implementation of a recommendation system on relational data. Using this framework, we implement as a case study a recommendation model that recommends books to the users. We evaluated the performance of our model on real data obtained from a Turkish Internet book store. Our experimental results show that our proposed method can be effectively used for recommending items in relational data.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6076418/,2011 International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies,7-9 Sept. 2011,ieeexplore

In the last years we also experienced an enormous development in the direction of network centric computing. Complex distributed environments emerge that enable and support the integration of systems and that allow new forms of automated cooperation. For an effective integration to take place, the autonomy of participants in the environment must be taken into consideration. Such environments represent then examples of autonomous decentralised systems (ADSs). In this paper the authors present their view on the convenience of applying mobile agents to ADSs.

Since there are a large quantity of products on each platform, it is necessary to classify the products based on their short descriptions and to learn the relationships between the different categories on multiple platforms. In this paper, we propose the Rectified Topic Classification model to classify products into hierarchical categories based on their short text descriptions. We adopt the topic model to capture the latent features of products from the noisy short descriptions generated by merchants. To reduce the uncertainty of the inferring topic features of a new product, we invoke the topic model several times to get a set of probabilistic feature results and adopt the convolutional neural network for classification. To learn the correlations between two platform categories, the mapping matrix is learned by using a set of seed products.

To identify the interests, existing studies merely focused on modeling the relationships between user generated contents and user interests. However, the interests of a user should not only be inferred by user generated contents, but also the relationships between users which might imply the user interests. In this paper, our goal is to unveil the true interests of users based on user generated contents as well as relationships between users. We built a probabilistic user interests model and proposed a user interests propagation algorithm (UIP) to tackle this problem. A factor graph-based approach is utilized to estimate the distribution of the interests of users. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of the model.

10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00084,Autonomous Graph Mining Algorithm Search with Best Speed/Accuracy Trade-off,IEEE,Conferences,"Graph data is ubiquitous in academia and industry, from social networks to bioinformatics. The pervasiveness of graphs today has raised the demand for algorithms that can answer various questions: Which products would a user like to purchase given her order list? Which users are buying fake followers to increase their public reputation? Myriads of new graph mining algorithms are proposed every year to answer such questions - each with a distinct problem formulation, computational time, and memory footprint. This lack of unity makes it difficult for a practitioner to compare different algorithms and pick the most suitable one for a specific application. These challenges - even more severe for non-experts - create a gap in which state-of-the-art techniques developed in academic settings fail to be optimally deployed in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoGM, an automated system for graph mining algorithm development. We first define a unified framework UnifiedGM that integrates various message-passing based graph algorithms, ranging from conventional algorithms like PageRank to graph neural networks. Then UnifiedGM defines a search space in which five parameters are required to determine a graph algorithm. Under this search space, AutoGM explicitly optimizes for the optimal parameter set of UnifiedGM using Bayesian Optimization. AutoGM defines a novel budget-aware objective function for the optimization to incorporate a practical issue - finding the best speed-accuracy trade-off under a computation budget - into the graph algorithm generation problem. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AutoGM generates novel graph mining algorithms with the best speed/accuracy trade-off compared to existing models with heuristic parameters.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9338289/,2020 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM),17-20 Nov. 2020,ieeexplore

This paper computes one day-ahead (DA) quantile forecasts of electricity prices in a highly volatile market by applying regression models to a pool of point forecasts. Three data-driven forecasting methods are implemented to generate DA point forecasts of the Ontario market’s electricity prices. In order to generate the three sets of point forecasts, we use: i) the triple exponential smoothing (TES) method, ii) a neural network (NN) that combines layers of Convolutional neurons and gradient recurrent units (GRU), iii) an extreme gradient boosted (XGB) non-linear regression approach. Performance of the three models compared against a benchmark which considers the forecast of electricity prices as the average price of the same hour and day during the last four weeks. The TES method decreases the mean absolute error (MAE) of the benchmark model from 10.29 to 9.42. The Convolutional GRU (ConvGRU) model and XGB regression also reduce the MAE to 8.20 and 7.06, respectively. Finally, quantile regression averaging (QRA) is applied to the pool of point forecasts obtained by TES, ConvGRU, and XGB methods to compute DA quantile forecasts of electricity prices. Moreover, the QRA method is further developed in this work by employing gradient boosting non-linear regression (GBR).

Nowadays, people show interest in online shopping to meet their demands increasingly. For researchers and students, finding and buying the desired books from online shops is very tedious work. Recently Recommender System is an excellent tool to deal with such problems, but the Recommender System is suffering from multiple problems such as data sparsity, cold-start, and inaccuracy. To address these problems, we propose Deep Edu a novel Deep Neural Collaborative Filtering for educational services recommendation. A Deep Edu architecture consists of three parts of a Deep Neural Network model (such as input layer, a multilayered perceptron, and an output layer). The Deep Edu provides the following contributions: first, the users' identifier and books identifier features are mapped into N-dimensional dense embedding vectors, second, the Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) takes the N-dimensional and non-linear features. To increase the performance of Deep Edu in all metrics, we proposed the advance Loss function. Equipped with the following, Deep Edu not only capable of learning the N-dimensional and non-linear interactions between users' identifier and books identifier, but moreover, it also considerably mitigates the cold-start, data sparsity, and inaccuracy problem. Over significant experiments performed on real-world good books dataset, the results show that Deep Edu's recommendation performance obviously outperforms existing Educational services recommendation methods.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9117112/,IEEE Access,2020,ieeexplore
10.1109/JIOT.2016.2556006,Optimized Day-Ahead Pricing With Renewable Energy Demand-Side Management for Smart Grids,IEEE,Journals,"Internet of Things (IoT) has recently emerged as an enabling technology for context-aware and interconnected “smart things.” Those smart things along with advanced power engineering and wireless communication technologies have realized the possibility of next generation electrical grid, smart grid, which allows users to deploy smart meters, monitoring their electric condition in real time. At the same time, increased environmental consciousness is driving electric companies to replace traditional generators with renewable energy sources which are already productive in user's homes. One of the most incentive ways is for electric companies to institute electricity buying-back schemes to encourage end users to generate more renewable energy. Different from the previous works, we consider renewable energy buying-back schemes with dynamic pricing to achieve the goal of energy efficiency for smart grids. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem as a convex optimization dual problem and propose a day-ahead time-dependent pricing scheme in a distributed manner which provides increased user privacy. The proposed framework seeks to achieve maximum benefits for both users and electric companies. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to tackle the time-dependent problem for smart grids with consideration of environmental benefits of renewable energy. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can significantly reduce peak time loading and efficiently balance system energy distribution.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7457198/,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,April 2017,ieeexplore
