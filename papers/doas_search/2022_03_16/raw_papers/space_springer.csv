A state-constrained finite-time attitude control scheme is designed by making full use of the model feature of the quaternion. Based on the homogeneous domination approach, the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is proved. It proves that the angular velocity can be constrained within the limited range at any time. For the attitude loop dynamics subsystem with external disturbances, based on a radial basis function neural network, an integral terminal sliding mode controller is proposed. Finally, the validity and advantages of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated in the simulation section compared with the other two control methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-021-06056-w,springer

According to this rhetoric, similar to the space race of the twentieth century, AI development is portrayed as a rivalry among superpowers where one country will win and reap major benefits, while others will be left behind. Using this rhetoric to frame AI development tends to prioritize narrow and short-term economic interests over broader and longer-term societal needs. Three particularly problematic aspects of using space race narrative in AI discussions are highlighted: first, perceiving technology development globally as a zero-sum game; second, pressuring governments to regulate less; and third, prioritising high technologies over social issues. This contribution invites to challenge underlying political assumptions of the AI space race discourse and to open up conversations about alternative futures.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00146-022-01423-0,springer

These problems lead to the frequent communication interruptions and poor stability of 3D UAV networks. Facing these challenges, we propose deep neural network routing (DNNR) that is characterized by a dynamic 3D two-subspace division (i.e., vertical-axis cylinder and horizontal-plane divisions) and deep neural network (DNN) forwarding. With the trajectories of base station and nodes changing, vertical-axis cylinder and horizontal-plane divisions also change dynamically according to the broadcast information. Different from multi subspace division, this kind of two subspace divisions could reduce the complexity of routing discovery and make full use of the dynamic adaptability of 3D space division against the rapidly changing network topology. Due to the DNN flexibility, DNN forwarding is a promising scheme to improve the probability of recognizing the available links and select the rational next-hop node. We implement four compared protocols and DNNR in NS3 network simulator and test them for various application scenarios, when changing base station speed, node speed, horizontal plane size, and vertical height. Comparing with four protocols, DNNR achieves better performance in terms of packet delivery rate and energy-saving performance. These indicate that 3D space division is a concise and feasible scheme in flight ad hoc networks which may be extended to other fields. Besides, owing to the flexibility and prevalent availability, machine learning routing protocols are becoming a popular technology.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11277-022-09602-4,springer

Recently, large-scale geometry data become more and more available, and the learned geometry priors have been successfully applied to 3D computer vision and computer graphics fields. Different from the regular representation of images, surface meshes have irregular structures with different vertex numbers and topologies. Therefore, the traditional convolution neural networks used for images cannot be directly used to handle surface meshes, and thus, many methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of existing geometric deep learning methods for mesh processing. We first introduce the relevant knowledge and theoretical background of geometric deep learning and some basic mesh data knowledge, including some commonly used mesh datasets. Then, we review various deep learning models for mesh data with two different types: graph-based methods and mesh structure-based methods.

The traditional classification method mainly relies on the user’s manual marking, but the accuracy of automatic classification has some defects. With the development of convolutional neural network(CNN), the design of lightweight neural network has become a hot topic. However, the state-of-the-art studies always sacrifice classification accuracy for network lightweight, which greatly frustrates usability. In this paper, a new neural network framework, named MobVi, is proposed to enhance the precision of lightweight neural network by solution space division. MobVi is including image solution space division and judgment class. The former uses clustering method based on deep learning to distinguish which small solution space the image belongs to, while the latter uses lightweight neural network customized for the solution space to judge the class. In order to reduce the amount of model parameters and calculations, we designed a customized CNN module. Finally, we propose an energy prediction model to measure whether the model can be successfully implemented on mobile devices. A series of experiments have proved that MobVi has better performance than most existing models for mobile devices.

Research into the performance of CNNs on synthetic light curve data-sets has shown significant promise that has not yet translated into success when working with empirically collected light curves. This limitation appears to be due to a number of factors including: mixing of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) signatures, the effects of sensor noise, and blurring due to atmospheric turbulence. A synthetic data-set of approximately 7500 light curves was generated that takes into account realistic BRDF signatures and environmental parameters. The RSO used in this study was texture mapped with three unique material BRDF signatures: silicon solar panel, glossy paint, and aluminum. A two-step BRDF model inversion of the Beard-Maxwell model was performed using empirically collected data-sets of these materials in order to physically derive the BRDF model parameters. The CNN was trained on light curves resulting from the RSO performing four different maneuvers: tumbling, accelerating in rotational rate, stabilizing, and inactive (or stable in rotation rate). The CNN achieved an overall classification accuracy of 86.2% across the four maneuver classes. A confusion matrix analysis of the different classes of maneuvers suggested that our model performed best when classifying tumbling and accelerating RSOs (94% accuracy) and worst at classifying inactive RSOs (60% accuracy). This performance limitation when classifying inactive RSOs is attributed to (1) back-scatter signatures and specular glints within the synthetic light curves of inactive satellites being mistaken as attitude maneuvers, and (2) low signal-to-noise ratio due to factors such as atmospheric blurring. These results suggest that CNNs have strong potential for aiding in the problem of classifying satellite attitude status from light curves, but that machine learning research must focus on developing training sets and pre-processing techniques that account for these complications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40295-022-00309-z,springer

Besides, a robust control item is also considered in the controller to resist external disturbances. During hyperparameters optimization, the EPSO optimizer iteratively optimizes the hyperparameters of the RBFNN controller using the composite error of the system output.

The $$f\left(\mathbf{X}|y\right)$$ f X | y is estimated by a kernel estimator. The GRNN was modified. Instead of the Euclidean distance of all predictors, we look for various metric spaces of predictors that minimize cross-validation error. This approach was used in the search for the GMM whose predictors include values describing focal mechanisms. Nodal plane angles were applied. GMMs containing different predictor configurations were compared. It was noticed that rake and strike nodal plane angles have an impact on the GRNN GMM while the dip angle does not.

The analysis of these digital radiographs is time consuming and costly. Attempts to automate the analysis using conventional computer vision methods or shallow machine learning have not, thus far, provided performance equivalent to human inspectors due to the high reliability requirements and low contrast to noise ratio of the defects. Modern approaches based on deep learning have made considerable progress towards reliable automated analysis. However, limited data sets render current machine learning solutions insufficient for industrial use. Moreover, industrial acceptance would require performance demonstration using standard metrics in non-destructive evaluation, such as probability of detection (POD), which are not commonly used in previous studies. In this study, data augmentation with virtual flaws was used to overcome data scarcity, and compared with conventional data augmentation. A semantic segmentation network was trained to find defects from computed radiography data of aerospace welds. Standard evaluation metrics in non-destructive testing were adopted for the comparison. Finally, the network was deployed as an inspector’s aid in a realistic environment to predict flaws from production radiographs. The network achieved high detection reliability and defect sizing performance, and an acceptable false call rate. Virtual flaw augmentation was found to significantly improve performance, especially for limited data set sizes, and for underrepresented flaw types even at large data sets.

Naturally, distance measures have a great impact on clustering performance. Different distances and their combinations are tested on both the original and feature spaces. The combined distances were obtained by using different optimal weights that minimize classification errors in different measures via a series of optimization models. These weights were multiplied by their respective distances in order to create the combined distance. Clustering was evaluated using silhouette scores.

This technique can verify some properties such as reachability in which the entire state space is searched to find the desired state. However, model checking may lead to the state space explosion problem in which all states cannot be generated due to the exponential resource usage. Although the results of recent model checking approaches are promising, there is still room for improvement in terms of accuracy and the number of explored states. In this paper, using deep reinforcement learning and two neural networks, we propose an approach to increase the accuracy of the generated witnesses and reduce the use of hardware resources. In this approach, at first, an agent starts to explore the state space without any knowledge and gradually identifies the proper and improper actions by receiving different rewards/penalties from the environment to achieve the goal. Once the dataset is fulfilled with the agent's experiences, two neural networks evaluate the quality of each operation in each state, and afterwards, the best action is selected. The significant difficulties and challenges in the implementation are encoding the states, feature engineering, feature selection, reward engineering, handling invalid actions, and configuring the neural network. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented in the Groove toolset, and as a result, in most of the case studies, it overcame the problem of state space explosion. Also, this approach outperforms the existing solutions in terms of generating shorter witnesses and exploring fewer states. On average, the proposed approach is nearly 400% better than other approaches in exploring fewer states and 300% better than the others in generating shorter witnesses. Also, on average, the proposed approach is 37% more accurate than the others in terms of finding the goals state.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00500-022-06815-4,springer

Inverse modeling in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering involves minimizing the mismatch between observed and simulated data from a set of prior models. A myriad of approaches has been developed to accomplish this goal over the years, and their performance is dependent on the effectiveness of parameterization and the capability of data conditioning technique. We demonstrate LSI as a more robust and efficient approach for calibration of subsurface model over traditional approaches where dimensionality reduction of model parameters is done independently (decoupled) of flow data integration. LSI provides a compact description of the parameters in a latent space that does not only exploit the redundancy of large-scale geologic features but also retain features that are sensitive to flow data. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning research, LSI architecture involves a pair of deep convolutional autoencoders that are coupled to jointly extract spatial geologic features in subsurface models and temporal trends in flow data. The LSI architecture is trained offline using prior model realizations and their corresponding simulated flow responses (as training data) to effectively represent the model and data and to learn the complex nonlinear inverse mapping between data and model. Once field data becomes available, calibrated models can be rapidly obtained using the trained LSI architecture. The resulting data-informed model latent space can be explored to allow the generation of an ensemble of calibrated model realizations around the inversion solution. This is especially useful when observed data is noisy and multiple inversion solutions can be accepted within the noise range. We present several inversion examples to illustrate the performance of LSI and to discuss the advantages and limitations of data-driven inversion approaches compared to the conventional inverse modelling formulations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10596-021-10104-8,springer

Image quality, in terms of spatial resolution and noise, is strongly dependent on acquisition duration. A typical brain MRI scan may last several minutes, with total protocol duration often exceeding 30 minutes. Long scan duration leads to poor patient experience, long waiting time for appointments, and high costs. Therefore, shortening MRI scans is crucial. In this paper, we investigate the enhancement of low-resolution (LR) brain MRI scanning, to enable shorter acquisition times without compromising the diagnostic value of the images. Methods We propose a novel fully convolutional neural enhancement approach. It is optimized for accelerated LR MRI acquisitions obtained by reducing the acquisition matrix size only along phase encoding direction. The network is trained to transform the LR acquisitions into corresponding high-resolution (HR) counterparts in an end-to-end manner. In contrast to previous neural-based MRI enhancement algorithms, such as DAGAN, the LR images used for training are real acquisitions rather than smoothed, downsampled versions of the HR images. Results The proposed method is validated qualitatively and quantitatively for an acceleration factor of 4. Favourable comparison is demonstrated against the state-of-the-art DeblurGAN and DAGAN algorithms in terms of PSNR and SSIM scores. The result was further confirmed by an image quality rating experiment performed by four senior neuroradiologists. Conclusions The proposed method may become a valuable tool for scan time reduction in brain MRI. In continuation of this research, the validation should be extended to larger datasets acquired for different imaging protocols, and considering several MRI machines produced by different vendors.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11548-021-02535-6,springer

Storing all such sequential data and updating the model over entire data incur large amount of computational resources in space and time. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a practical method, termed onlineGPSSM , that incorporates stochastic variational inference (VI) and online VI with novel formulation. The proposed method mitigates the computational complexity without catastrophic forgetting and also support adaptation to changes in a system and/or real environments.

A priori, the design variable domains for which a simulation converges and fulfills the imposed constraints are usually unknown and it can become very time-consuming to distinguish feasible from infeasible design variable choices by simply running the simulation for each choice. To support the exploration of the design variable space for such scenarios, an adaptive sampling technique based on machine learning models has recently been proposed. However, that approach only considers the exploration of the convergent domain and ignores additional constraints.

Hence, this is a tough task to approximate the high-dimensional space using neural networks. To address this, here proposes the method that neural networks approximate a high-dimensional function that can effectively approach the high-dimensional space, rather than using neural networks to directly approximate the high-dimensional space. Hence, two boundaries were derived by Lipschitz condition, i.e., the one is that neural networks approximate a high-dimensional function, and the other is that a high-dimensional function approaches the high-dimensional space. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method is effective and outperforms the competing methods in the performance to approximate the high-dimensional space. We find that this manner of using neural networks to approximate a high-dimensional function that can effectively approach the high-dimensional space is more resistance to the curse of dimensionality. In addition, the ability of the proposed method to approximate the high-dimensional space is related to the number of hidden layers and the choice of high-dimensional functions, but more relies on the latter. Our findings demonstrate that it is no obvious dependency between the number of hidden layers respecting the proposed method and the choice for high-dimensional functions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11227-021-04038-2,springer

Recent AM literature utilising machine learning methods tend to make predictions about flaws or porosity without considering the dynamical nature of the process. This leads to increases in false detections as useful information about the signal is lost. This study takes a different approach and investigates learning a physical model of the laser powder bed fusion process dynamics. In addition, deep representation learning enables this to be achieved directly from high speed videos. This representation is combined with a predictive state space model which is learned in a semi-supervised manner, requiring only the optimal laser parameter to be characterised. The model, referred to as FlawNet, was exploited to measure offsets between predicted and observed states resulting in a highly robust metric, known as the dynamic signature. This feature also correlated strongly with a global material quality metric, namely porosity. The model achieved state-of-the-art results with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.999 when differentiating between optimal and unstable laser parameters. Furthermore, there was a demonstrated potential to detect changes in ultra-dense, 0.1% porosity, materials with an ROC AUC of 0.944, suggesting an ability to detect anomalous events prior to the onset of significant material degradation. The method has merit for the purposes of detecting out of process distributions, while maintaining data efficiency. Subsequently, the generality of the methodology would suggest the solution is applicable to different laser processing systems and can potentially be adapted to a number of different sensing modalities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10845-021-01842-8,springer

We establish that allowing the networks to have certain types of “skip connections” does not change the resulting approximation spaces. We also discuss the role of the network’s nonlinearity (also known as activation function) on the resulting spaces, as well as the role of depth. For the popular ReLU nonlinearity and its powers, we relate the newly constructed spaces to classical Besov spaces. The established embeddings highlight that some functions of very low Besov smoothness can nevertheless be well approximated by neural networks, if these networks are sufficiently deep.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00365-021-09543-4,springer

This is the set of functions endowed with a quantity which can control the approximation and estimation errors by a particular machine learning model. In this paper, we address this issue for two representative neural network models: the two-layer networks and the residual neural networks. We define the Barron space and show that it is the right space for two-layer neural network models in the sense that optimal direct and inverse approximation theorems hold for functions in the Barron space. For residual neural network models, we construct the so-called flow-induced function space and prove direct and inverse approximation theorems for this space. In addition, we show that the Rademacher complexity for bounded sets under these norms has the optimal upper bounds.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00365-021-09549-y,springer

However, in humans, short-term working memory that is dependent on frontal and parietal cortices can also play an important role, particularly in commonly used paradigms in which learning is relatively condensed in time. Given the growing use of reward-based learning tasks in translational studies in computational psychiatry, it is important to understand the extent of the influence of working memory and also how core gradual learning mechanisms can be better isolated. In our experiments, we manipulated the spacing between repetitions along with a post-learning delay preceding a test phase. We found that learning was slower for stimuli repeated after a long delay (spaced-trained) compared to those repeated immediately (massed-trained), likely reflecting the remaining contribution of feedback learning mechanisms when working memory is not available. For massed learning, brief interruptions led to drops in subsequent performance, and individual differences in working memory capacity positively correlated with overall performance. Interestingly, when tested after a delay period but not immediately, relative preferences decayed in the massed condition and increased in the spaced condition. Our results provide additional support for a large role of working memory in reward-based learning in temporally condensed designs. We suggest that spacing training within or between sessions is a promising approach to better isolate and understand mechanisms supporting gradual reward-based learning, with particular importance for understanding potential learning dysfunctions in addiction and psychiatric disorders.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.3758/s13421-021-01233-7,springer

The solution of the case of two hidden layers presented in this paper is crucial as it can be further generalized to deeper neural networks. We approach the problem by sampling actively finite difference approximations to Hessians of the network. Gathering several approximate Hessians allows reliably to approximate the matrix subspace $$\mathcal W$$ W spanned by symmetric tensors $$a_1 \otimes a_1,\dots ,a_{m_0}\otimes a_{m_0}$$ a 1 ⊗ a 1 , ⋯ , a m 0 ⊗ a m 0 formed by weights of the first layer together with the entangled symmetric tensors $$v_1 \otimes v_1 ,\dots ,v_{m_1}\otimes v_{m_1}$$ v 1 ⊗ v 1 , ⋯ , v m 1 ⊗ v m 1 , formed by suitable combinations of the weights of the first and second layer as $$v_\ell =A G_0 b_\ell /\Vert A G_0 b_\ell \Vert _2$$ v ℓ = A G 0 b ℓ / ‖ A G 0 b ℓ ‖ 2 , $$\ell \in [m_1]$$ ℓ ∈ [ m 1 ] , for a diagonal matrix $$G_0$$ G 0 depending on the activation functions of the first layer. The identification of the 1-rank symmetric tensors within $$\mathcal W$$ W is then performed by the solution of a robust nonlinear program, maximizing the spectral norm of the competitors constrained over the unit Frobenius sphere. We provide guarantees of stable recovery under a posteriori verifiable conditions. Once the 1-rank symmetric tensors $$\{a_i \otimes a_i, i\in [m_0]\}\cup \{v_\ell \otimes v_\ell , \ell \in [m_1] \}$$ { a i ⊗ a i , i ∈ [ m 0 ] } ∪ { v ℓ ⊗ v ℓ , ℓ ∈ [ m 1 ] } are computed, we address their correct attribution to the first or second layer ( $$a_i$$ a i ’s are attributed to the first layer). The attribution to the layers is currently based on a semi-heuristic reasoning, but it shows clear potential of reliable execution. Having the correct attribution of the $$a_i,v_\ell $$ a i , v ℓ to the respective layers and the consequent de-parametrization of the network, by using a suitably adapted gradient descent iteration, it is possible to estimate, up to intrinsic symmetries, the shifts of the activations functions of the first layer and compute exactly the matrix $$G_0$$ G 0 . Eventually, from the vectors $$v_\ell =A G_0 b_\ell /\Vert A G_0 b_\ell \Vert _2$$ v ℓ = A G 0 b ℓ / ‖ A G 0 b ℓ ‖ 2 ’s and $$a_i$$ a i ’s one can disentangle the weights $$b_\ell $$ b ℓ ’s, by simple algebraic manipulations. Our method of identification of the weights of the network is fully constructive, with quantifiable sample complexity and therefore contributes to dwindle the black box nature of the network training phase. We corroborate our theoretical results by extensive numerical experiments, which confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithmic pipeline.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00365-021-09550-5,springer

In this paper, we propose an sample based independent learning method, named Sample Continuous Coordination with recursive Frequency Maximum Q-Value (SCC-rFMQ), which divides the multiagent cooperative problem with continuous actions into two layers. The first layer samples a finite set of actions from the continuous action spaces by a re-sampling mechanism with variable exploratory rates, and the second layer evaluates the actions in the sampled action set and updates the policy using a reinforcement learning cooperative method. By constructing cooperative mechanisms at both levels, SCC-rFMQ can handle cooperative problems in continuous action cooperative Markov games effectively. The effectiveness of SCC-rFMQ is experimentally demonstrated on two well-designed games, i.e., a continuous version of the climbing game and a cooperative version of the boat problem.

In the present work, we propose non-intrusive materials informatics methods for the high-throughput exploration and analysis of a synthetic microstructure space using a machine learning-reinforced multi-phase-field modeling scheme. We specifically study the interface energy space as one of the most uncertain inputs in phase-field modeling and its impact on the shape and contact angle of a growing phase during heterogeneous solidification of secondary phase between solid and liquid phases. We evaluate and discuss methods for the study of sensitivity and propagation of uncertainty in these input parameters as reflected on the shape of the Cu_6Sn_5 intermetallic during growth over the Cu substrate inside the liquid Sn solder due to uncertain interface energies. The sensitivity results rank σ _ SI , σ _ IL , and σ _ IL , respectively, as the most influential parameters on the shape of the intermetallic. Furthermore, we use variational autoencoder, a deep generative neural network method, and label spreading, a semi-supervised machine learning method for establishing correlations between inputs of outputs of the computational model. We clustered the microstructures into three categories (“wetting”, “dewetting”, and “invariant”) using the label spreading method and compared it with the trend observed in the Young-Laplace equation. On the other hand, a structure map in the interface energy space is developed that shows σ _ SI and σ _ SL alter the shape of the intermetallic synchronously where an increase in the latter and decrease in the former changes the shape from dewetting structures to wetting structures. The study shows that the machine learning-reinforced phase-field method is a convenient approach to analyze microstructure design space in the framework of the ICME.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1186/s41313-021-00038-0,springer

Our application provides an efficient and robust way of occupancy detection in various light conditions, weather conditions, presence of shadows, and partial occlusions.

Along with this, the LSTM model is trained based on the classification data provided by the CNN model collected over a long period to predict the future availability of parking lots based on the specific day of the week, festival, and national holiday. Additionally, a deep learning model is used as an alarming system to detect unwanted events occurring in the parking space. This security system which detects oddity helps to improve the reliability of the system and cameras. No manual monitoring is required due to this anomaly detection system which takes the same input as the slot detection model.

In general, machine and deep learning are employed as discriminative models within a supervised setting. Progress in unsupervised generative modelling allows for generative models to be employed in discriminative (discrete classes) and deviation (continuous deviation from a baseline) tasks. This only requires the samples to be chronological. Discriminative and deviation analysis is usually based on the reconstruction loss. However, this is limited as it offers only a single scalar from which inference can be made. Generative models do, however, learn a latent representation of the data from which additional scalars can be derived. Whether these derived scalars are informative depends on the quality of the latent representations. Most learning algorithms derive a latent representation that efficiently explains the variance in the data, which can be informative when the property of interest is well explained by variance. Alternatively, a lesser known class of learning algorithms aim to learn a latent representation that aims to identify sources in the data. Hence, given the same data, an infinite number of latent representations are possible, of which only a fraction are informative. We consider three classes of latent spaces that are stochastic, entangled and untangled. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of untangled latent spaces to obtain informative signals for condition monitoring.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-85584-0_5,springer

Methods A total of 507 hip CT examinations of patients 20–55 years old were retrospectively examined, and JSW, center-edge (CE) angle, alpha angle, anterior acetabular sector angle (AASA), and neck-shaft angle (NSA) were recorded. Dysplasia and severe JSN were defined with CE angle < 25^o and JSW< 2 mm, respectively. A random forest classifier was developed to predict severe JSN based on anatomical and demographical data. Multivariate linear regression and two-step unsupervised clustering were performed to identify factors linked to JSW. Results In dysplastic hips, lateral or anterior undercoverage alone was not correlated to JSN. AASA ( p < 0.005) and CE angle ( p < 0.032) were the only factors significantly correlated with JSN in dysplastic hips. In non-dysplastic hips, JSW was inversely correlated to CE angle, AASA, and age and positively correlated to NSA ( p < 0.001). A random forest classifier predicted severe JSN (AUC 69.9%, 95%CI 47.9–91.8%). TwoStep cluster modelling identified two distinct patient clusters one with low and one with normal JSW and different anatomical characteristics. Conclusion Machine learning predicted severe JSN and identified population characteristics related to normal and abnormal joint space width. Dysplasia in one plane was found to be insufficient to cause JSN, highlighting the need for hip anatomy assessment on multiple planes. Key Points • Neither anterior nor lateral acetabular dysplasia was sufficient to independently reduce joint space width in a multivariate linear regression model of dysplastic hips. • A random forest classifier was developed based on measurements and demographic parameters from 507 hip joints, achieving an area under the curve of 69.9% in the external validation set, in predicting severe joint space narrowing based on anatomical hip parameters and age. • Unsupervised TwoStep cluster analysis revealed two distinct population groups, one with low and one with normal joint space width, characterised by differences in hip morphology",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00330-021-08070-x,springer

Using a single dynamics model, we see clear evidence of task confusion and reduced performance.

It was found that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has performed well on the enhanced root mean square error to LSTM, as it was 4.35% more accurate in predicting the direction and reduced processing time and RMSE by 78 s and 0.029, respectively. This study provides a better result in the accuracy of the stock index.

In fact, autonomous flight operations may be a key enabler for on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing (OSAM) missions, carrying inherent benefits such as cost and risk reduction. Within the spectrum of proximity operations, this work focuses on autonomous path-planning for the reconstruction of geometry properties of an uncooperative target. The autonomous navigation problem is called active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, and it has been largely studied within the field of robotics. Active SLAM problem may be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Previous works in astrodynamics have demonstrated that is possible to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to teach an agent that is moving along a pre-determined orbit when to collect measurements to optimize a given mapping goal. In this work, different RL methods are explored to develop an artificial intelligence agent capable of planning sub-optimal paths for autonomous shape reconstruction of an unknown and uncooperative object via imaging. Proximity orbit dynamics are linearized and include orbit eccentricity. The geometry of the target object is rendered by a polyhedron shaped with a triangular mesh. Artificial intelligent agents are created using both the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method. State-action value functions are approximated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and trained according to RL principles. Training of the RL agent architecture occurs under fixed or random initial environment conditions. A large database of training tests has been collected. Trained agents show promising performance in achieving extended coverage of the target. Policy learning is demonstrated by displaying that RL agents, at minimum, have higher mapping performance than agents that behave randomly. Furthermore, RL agent may learn to maneuver the spacecraft to control target lighting conditions as a function of the Sun location.

The procedure for real-time adaptation to an unknown parameter of an uncontrolled vehicle is given. It is shown that the real-time adaptation is possible within an acceptable time interval. The results of the adaptation to two parameters—the ballistic coefficient and the atmospheric density—are also presented.

Consequently, when such imputed data are classified, some uncertainty will be propagated to the classifier output. This leads to two issues to address. First, reducing the uncertainty in the imputed value. Second, modeling and processing of the uncertainty associated with the classifier output to arrive at a better decision. To deal with the first issue, we use a latent space representation, while for the second issue we use Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. First, we train a neural network using the data without any missing value to generate a latent space representation of the input. The complete data set is now extended by deleting every feature once. These missing values are estimated using a nearest neighbor-based scheme. The network is then refined using this extended dataset to obtain a better latent space. This mechanism is expected to reduce the effect of the missing data on the latent space representation. Using the latent space representation of the complete data, we train two classifiers, support vector machines and evidential t -nearest neighbors. To classify an input with a missing value, we make a rough estimate of the missing value using the nearest neighbor rule and generate its latent space representation for classification by the classifiers. Using each classifier output, we generate a basic probability assignment (BPA) and all BPAs are combined to get an overall BPA. Final classification is done using Pignistic probabilities computed on the overall BPA. We use three different ways to defining BPAs. To avoid some problems of Dempster’s rule of aggregation, we also use several alternative aggregations including some T-norm-based methods. Note that, T-norm has been used for combination of belief function in Pichon and Denœux (in: NAFIPS 2008: 2008 annual meeting of the North American fuzzy information processing society, pp 1–6, 2008).

However, there still exists aperformance gap at the fold level and the (relatively easier) family level, suggesting that it might be possible to learn an embedding space that better represents the protein folds. Results In this paper, we propose the FoldHSphere method to learn a better fold embedding space through a two-stage training procedure. We first obtain prototype vectors for each fold class that are maximally separated in hyperspherical space. We then train a neural network by minimizing the angular large margin cosine loss to learn protein embeddings clustered around the corresponding hyperspherical fold prototypes. Our network architectures, ResCNN-GRU and ResCNN-BGRU, process the input protein sequences by applying several residual-convolutional blocks followed by a gated recurrent unit-based recurrent layer. Evaluation results on the LINDAHL dataset indicate that the use of our hyperspherical embeddings effectively bridges the performance gap at the family and fold levels. Furthermore, our FoldHSpherePro ensemble method yields an accuracy of 81.3% at the fold level, outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.

Its main premise is to learn how to complete tasks by interacting with the environment and observing which actions are more optimal with respect to a reward signal. Methods from reinforcement learning have long been applied in aerospace and have more recently seen renewed interest in space applications. Problems in spacecraft control can benefit from the use of intelligent techniques when faced with significant uncertainties—as is common for space environments. Solving these control problems using reinforcement learning remains a challenge partly due to long training times and sensitivity in performance to hyperparameters which require careful tuning. In this work we seek to address both issues for a sample spacecraft control problem. To reduce training times compared to other approaches, we simplify the problem by discretising the action space and use a data-efficient algorithm to train the agent. Furthermore, we employ an automated approach to hyperparameter selection which optimises for a specified performance metric. Our approach is tested on a 3-DOF powered descent problem with uncertainties in the initial conditions. We run experiments with two different problem formulations—using a ‘shaped’ state representation to guide the agent and also a ‘raw’ state representation with unprocessed values of position, velocity and mass. The results show that an agent can learn a near-optimal policy efficiently by appropriately defining the action-space and state-space. Using the raw state representation led to ‘reward-hacking’ and poor performance, which highlights the importance of the problem and state-space formulation in successfully training reinforcement learning agents. In addition, we show that the optimal hyperparameters can vary significantly based on the choice of loss function. Using two sets of hyperparameters optimised for different loss functions, we demonstrate that in both cases the agent can find near-optimal policies with comparable performance to previously applied methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11081-021-09687-z,springer

However, the real natural cores suffer from their own instability and constant weathering or erosion as well as experimental damages, leading to the changes of their physical and chemical characteristics. Digital cores can address the above issues by core digitalization and then reusing the original core images or data without damaging the real samples. The 3D reconstruction of pore space actually is an important step for the construction of 3D digital cores. There are two main ways for the reconstruction of pore space including physical experimental methods and numerical reconstruction methods. Physical experimental methods usually are quite time-consuming and expensive while numerical reconstruction methods are relatively inexpensive and more efficient. With the flourishing development of deep learning and its variants, the reconstruction of pore space possibly can benefit from the strong inherent ability of extracting characteristics from training images (TIs) hidden in deep learning. This paper proposes a reconstruction method using a deep residual deconvolution network (DRDN), considered as a variant of deep learning, in which the characteristics of TI are learned by using constant residual convolution in training and then the pore space is reconstructed by adding the previous residual convolution results to each deconvolution layer. Compared to some other typical numerical reconstruction methods, our method shows its efficiency and practicability in the reconstruction of 3D pore space.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10596-021-10063-0,springer

Since high accuracy CNNs are both computation intensive and memory intensive, many researchers have shown significant interest in the accelerator design. Furthermore, the AI chip market size grows and the competition on the performance, cost, and power consumption of the artificial intelligence SoC designs is increasing. Therefore, it is important to develop design techniques and platforms that are useful for the efficient design of optimized AI architectures to satisfy the given specifications in a short design time.

By modifying both the on-chip SRAM size and the computing module size, a designer can explore the design space efficiently, and then choose the optimal architecture which shows the minimal cost while satisfying the performance specification.

Due to the subtle alterations in the amplitude, duration and morphology of the ECG, the development of computer-based intelligent system in the arrhythmia diagnosis field is attractive in terms of the amount of data and the importance of the data it contains for the classification of heartbeats from different types of arrhythmias. In the present study we propose a novel technique for the automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmia with one-lead ECG signals based upon variational mode decomposition (VMD), Shannon energy envelope, phase space reconstruction (PSR) and deterministic learning theory. First, VMD is employed to decompose the ECG signals into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the ECG signals’ energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. Second, Shannon energy is used to extract the characteristic envelope of predominant intrinsic modes. Third, phase space of the Shannon energy envelope (SEE) is reconstructed, in which properties associated with the nonlinear ECG characteristics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) phase space reconstruction (PSR) together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in ECG system dynamics between normal versus abnormal individual heartbeats. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify ECG system dynamics between normal (healthy) and arrhythmic ECG signals based on deterministic learning theory. Finally, experiments are carried out on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, in which 626 ECG signal fragments for one lead (MLII) from 28 persons of five classes of heartbeats were extracted. These five classes are normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), paced beat (PB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 98.72 $$\%$$ % .

However, there are two critical and challenging issues affecting the performance of NMF models. One is the selection of matrix factorization rank, while most of the existing methods are based on experiments or experience. For tackling this issue, an adaptive and stable NMF model is constructed based on an adaptive factorization rank selection (AFRS) strategy, which skillfully and simply integrates a row constraint similar to the generalized elastic net. The other is the sensitivity to the initial value of the iteration, which seriously affects the result of matrix factorization.

Moreover, the statistical consistency is discussed between the rank obtained by the proposed model and the ideal rank.

Often, Gaussian processes are trained on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems. These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired. However, previous literature observed computational burdens limiting deterministic global optimization to Gaussian processes trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the free variables and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence, we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement, probability of improvement, and lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, thus overcoming previous computational burdens.

The limiting threshold depends on a control signal which is a control signal provided by an inner loop as a function of the network internal state. In another sense, the damping mechanism modifies the network’s dynamics to stabilize the chaotic behaviour basically when the threshold mechanism fails. This mechanism is an outer feedback control loop evaluated when the model is chaotic and exponentially stabilizes it.

It is well known that when a Riemannian manifold is unfolded correctly, the observations lying spatially near to the manifold, should remain near on the lower dimension as well. Due to the nonlinear properties of manifold around each observation, finding such optimal neighborhood on the manifold is a challenge. Thus, a sub-optimal neighborhood may lead to erroneous representation and incorrect inferences. In this paper, we propose a rotation-based affinity metric for accurate graph Laplacian approximation. It exploits the property of aligned tangent spaces of observations in an optimal neighborhood to approximate correct affinity between them. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets have been performed. It is observed that proposed method outperforms existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques in low-dimensional representation for synthetic datasets. The results on real world datasets like COVID-19 prove that our approach increases the accuracy of classification by enhancing Laplacian regularization.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10044-020-00947-9,springer

However, its high time complexity is an issue to hinder its application since its base classifier shapelet transform includes a high time complexity of a distance calculation and shapelet selection. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a novel algorithm, i.e., short isometric shapelet transform (SIST), which contains two strategies to reduce the time complexity. The first strategy of SIST fixes the length of shapelet based on a simplified distance calculation, which largely reduces the number of shapelet candidates as well as speeds up the distance calculation in the ensemble shapelet transform algorithm. The second strategy is to train a single linear classifier in the feature space instead of an ensemble classifier. The theoretical evidence of these two strategies is presented to guarantee a near-lossless accuracy under some preconditions while reducing the time complexity.

The effect of regularization is very well understood when the penalty involves a Hilbertian norm. Another popular configuration is the use of an $$\ell _1$$ ℓ 1 -norm (or some variant thereof) that favors sparse solutions.

However, there is a lack of non-invasive methods to detect lymphovascular space invasion. Some researchers found that Tenascin-C and Cyclooxygenase-2 was correlated with lymphovascular space invasion. Radiomics has been studied as an emerging tool for distinguishing tumor pathology stage, evaluating treatment response, and predicting prognosis. This study aimed to establish a machine learning model that combines radiomics based on PET imaging with tenascin-C (TNC) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for predicting lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods One hundred and twelve patients with early-stage cervical squamous cell carcinoma who underwent PET/CT examination were retrospectively analyzed. Four hundred one radiomics features based on PET/CT images were extracted and integrated into radiomics score (Rad-score). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate TNC and COX-2 expression. Mann-Whitney U test was used to distinguish differences in the Rad-score, TNC, and COX-2 between LVSI and non-LVSI groups. The correlations of characteristics were tested by Spearman analysis. Machine learning models including radiomics model, protein model and combined model were established by logistic regression algorithm and evaluated by ROC curve. Pairwise comparisons of ROC curves were tested by DeLong test. Results The Rad-score of patients with LVSI was significantly higher than those without. A significant correlation was shown between LVSI and Rad-score ( r  = 0.631, p  < 0.001). TNC was correlated to both the Rad-score ( r  = 0.244, p  = 0.024) and COX-2 ( r  = 0.227, p  = 0.036). The radiomics model had the best predictive performance among all models in training and external dataset (AUCs: 0.914, 0.806, respectively, p  < 0.001). However, in testing dataset, the combined model had better efficiency for predicting LVSI than other models (AUCs: 0.801 vs. 0.756 and 0.801 vs. 0.631, respectively). Conclusion The machine learning model of the combination of PET radiomics with COX-2 and TNC provides a new tool for detecting LVSI in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. In the future, multicentric studies on larger sample of patients will be used to test the model.

Traditional detection methods, including radar, have many restrictions, such as excessive costs and energy supply problems. For many on-orbit servicing spacecraft, image recognition is a simple but relatively accurate method for obtaining sufficient position and direction information to offer services. However, to the best of our knowledge, few practical machine-learning models focusing on the recognition of spacecraft feature components have been reported. In addition, it is difficult to find substantial on-orbit images with which to train or evaluate such a model. In this study, we first created a new dataset containing numerous artificial images of on-orbit spacecraft with labeled components. Our base images were derived from 3D Max and STK software. These images include many types of satellites and satellite postures. Considering real-world illumination conditions and imperfect camera observations, we developed a degradation algorithm that enabled us to produce thousands of artificial images of spacecraft. The feature components of the spacecraft in all images were labeled manually. We discovered that direct utilization of the DeepLab V3+ model leads to poor edge recognition. Poorly defined edges provide imprecise position or direction information and degrade the performance of on-orbit services. Thus, the edge information of the target was taken as a supervisory guide, and was used to develop the proposed Edge Auxiliary Supervision DeepLab Network (EASDN) . The main idea of EASDN is to provide a new edge auxiliary loss by calculating the L2 loss between the predicted edge masks and ground-truth edge masks during training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our network can perform well both on our benchmark and on real on-orbit spacecraft images from the Internet.

A cooperative US–China process is urgently needed to mitigate these risks of adversarial strategic competition. Multi-tiered strategic dialogue—official, semi-official, and military-to-military—should form the foundation of such a process. That dialogue should be followed by exploration of more specific risk mitigation approaches and associated measures. Many approaches are possible; the two countries would need to work out the practical details of how to proceed. Parallel and reciprocated unilateral actions offer a means for both countries to signal intentions, exercise restraint, and address strategic concerns of the other country.

The space magnetization is justified by the coexistence of up to six disconnected attractors including both chaotic and periodic. The linear augmentation method is successfully applied to control the multistable HNNs into a monostable network. The control of the coexisting four attractors including a pair of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic attractors is made through three crises that enable the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Also, the control of six coexisting attractors (with two pairs of chaotic attractors and a pair of periodic one) is made through five crises enabling all the chaotic attractors to be metamorphosed in a monostable periodic attractor. Note that this controlled HNN is obtained for higher values of the coupling strength. These interesting results are obtained using nonlinear analysis tools such as the phase portraits, bifurcations diagrams, graph of maximum Lyapunov exponent, and basins of attraction. The obtained results have been perfectly supported using the PSPICE simulation environment.

Existing denoising methods in neural networks, such as using complex network architectures and introducing sparse techniques, always suffer from the difficulty of estimating hyperparameters and the lack of physical interpretability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel interpretable denoising layer based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as the first layer for standard neural networks, with the aim to combine the advantages of both traditional signal processing technology with physical interpretation and network modeling strategy with parameter adaption. By investigating the influencing mechanism of parameters on the regularization procedure in RKHS, the key parameter that dynamically controls the signal smoothness with low computational cost is selected as the only trainable parameter of the proposed layer. Besides, the forward and backward propagation algorithms of the designed layer are formulated to ensure that the selected parameter can be automatically updated together with other parameters in the neural network. Moreover, exponential and piecewise functions are introduced in the weight updating process to keep the trainable weight within a reasonable range and avoid the ill-conditioned problem.

Gaussian processes (GPs) are one of the popular approaches to exhibit the correlations between these different fidelity levels. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) that are functional compositions of GPs have also been adapted to multi-fidelity using the multi-fidelity deep Gaussian process (MF-DGP) model. This model increases the expressive power compared to GPs by considering non-linear correlations between fidelities within a Bayesian framework. However, these multi-fidelity methods consider only the case where the inputs of the different fidelity models are defined over the same domain of definition (e.g., same variables, same dimensions). However, due to simplification in the modeling of the low fidelity, some variables may be omitted or a different parametrization may be used compared to the high-fidelity model. In this paper, deep Gaussian processes for multi-fidelity (MF-DGP) are extended to the case where a different parametrization is used for each fidelity. The performance of the proposed multi-fidelity modeling technique is assessed on analytical test cases and on structural and aerodynamic real physical problems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s00158-020-02802-1,springer

The idea is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) and perform the regularized discriminant analysis on top of this and train it in an end-to-end fashion. The backpropagation is performed with a suitable optimizer to update the parameters so that the whole CNN approach minimizes the within class variance and maximizes the total class variance information suitable for both multi-class and binary class classification problems.

One of the methods developed is artificial neural networks-based deep learning method (DLM), which has become widespread in many areas recently and aimed to forecast ionospheric GPS-TEC variations with DLM. In this study, hourly resolution GPS-TEC values were obtained from five permanent GNSS stations in Turkey. DLM model is created by using the TEC variations and 9 different SWC index values between the years 2016 and 2018. The forecasting process (daily, three-daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual) was carried out for the prediction of the TEC variations that occurred in the first half-year of 2019.

For one, the curse of dimensionality often leads to overfitting as well as issues with scalability. This can bring about inaccurate models or those that require extensive compute time and resources. Additionally, variant calls may not be the optimal encoding for a given learning task, which also contributes to poor predictive capabilities. To address these issues, we present Harvestman , a method that takes advantage of hierarchical relationships among the possible biological interpretations and representations of genomic variants to perform automatic feature learning, feature selection, and model building. Results We demonstrate that Harvestman scales to thousands of genomes comprising more than 84 million variants by processing phase 3 data from the 1000 Genomes Project, one of the largest publicly available collection of whole genome sequences. Using breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that Harvestman selects a rich combination of representations that are adapted to the learning task, and performs better than a binary representation of SNPs alone. We compare Harvestman to existing feature selection methods and demonstrate that our method is more parsimonious —it selects smaller and less redundant feature subsets while maintaining accuracy of the resulting classifier. Conclusion Harvestman is a hierarchical feature selection approach for supervised model building from variant call data. By building a knowledge graph over genomic variants and solving an integer linear program , Harvestman automatically and optimally finds the right encoding for genomic variants. Compared to other hierarchical feature selection methods, Harvestman is faster and selects features more parsimoniously.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s12859-021-04096-6,springer

Downstream learning tasks on these incomplete networks can produce low quality results. In addition, reducing the incompleteness of the network can be costly and nontrivial. As a result, network discovery algorithms optimized for specific downstream learning tasks given resource collection constraints are of great interest. In this paper, we formulate the task-specific network discovery problem as a sequential decision-making problem. Our downstream task is selective harvesting, the optimal collection of vertices with a particular attribute. We propose a framework, called network actor critic (NAC), which learns a policy and notion of future reward in an offline setting via a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The NAC paradigm utilizes a task-specific network embedding to reduce the state space complexity. A detailed comparative analysis of popular network embeddings is presented with respect to their role in supporting offline planning. Furthermore, a quantitative study is presented on various synthetic and real benchmarks using NAC and several baselines. We show that offline models of reward and network discovery policies lead to significantly improved performance when compared to competitive online discovery algorithms.

DeFN can issue probabilistic forecasts of solar flares in two categories, such as ≥ M-class and < M-class events or ≥  C-class and < C-class events, occurring in the next 24 h after observations and the maximum class of flares occurring in the next 24 h. DeFN is set to run every 6 h and has been operated since January 2019. The input database of solar observation images taken by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is downloaded from the data archive operated by the Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) of Stanford University. Active regions are automatically detected from magnetograms, and 79 features are extracted from each region nearly in real time using multiwavelength observation data. Flare labels are attached to the feature database, and then, the database is standardized and input into DeFN for prediction. DeFN was pretrained using the datasets obtained from 2010 to 2015. The model was evaluated with the skill score of the true skill statistics (TSS) and achieved predictions with TSS = 0.80 for ≥  M-class flares and TSS = 0.63 for ≥  C-class flares. For comparison, we evaluated the operationally forecast results from January 2019 to June 2020. We found that operational DeFN forecasts achieved TSS = 0.70 (0.84) for ≥  C-class flares with the probability threshold of 50 (40)%, although there were very few M-class flares during this period and we should continue monitoring the results for a longer time. Here, we adopted a chronological split to divide the database into two for training and testing. The chronological split appears suitable for evaluating operational models. Furthermore, we proposed the use of time-series cross-validation. The procedure achieved TSS = 0.70 for ≥  M-class flares and 0.59 for ≥  C-class flares using the datasets obtained from 2010 to 2017.

In the present study, we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmia with one-lead ECG signals based upon tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR), and neural networks. First, ECG signals are decomposed into a set of frequency sub-bands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method without any preprocessing of QRS detection. Second, VMD is employed to decompose the sub-band of ECG signals into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the ECG signals’ energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. They are selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear ECG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrates significant difference in ECG system dynamics between normal versus abnormal individual heartbeats. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify ECG system dynamics between normal (healthy) and arrhythmia ECG signals.

These models have taken the field by storm, partially due to the resurgence of connectionist architectures, but also due to their remarkable success at fitting human data. However, predictive embedding models also inherit the weaknesses of their ancestors. In this paper, we explore the effect of catastrophic interference (CI), long known to be a flaw with neural network models, on a modern neural embedding model of semantic representation ( word2vec ). We use homonyms as an index of bias as a function of the order in which a corpus is learned. If the corpus is learned in random order, the final representation will tend towards the dominant sense of the word ( bank ➔ money ) as opposed to the subordinate sense ( bank ➔ river ). However, if the subordinate sense is presented to the network after learning the dominant sense, CI almost completely erases the dominant sense and the final representation strongly tends towards the more recent subordinate sense. We demonstrate the impact of CI and sequence of learning on the final neural embeddings learned by word2vec in both an artificial language and in an English corpus. Further, we evaluate the effectiveness of a recently proposed solution to CI from neuroscience, elastic weight consolidation, as well as a Hebbian learning architecture from the memory literature that does not produce an error signal on mitigating the effects of CI.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s42113-020-00089-5,springer

While these models can be used to answer many important questions, their utility is still harshly criticized, being extremely challenging to identify which data descriptors are the most adequate to represent a given specific phenomenon of interest. With a recent experience in the development of a deep learning model designed to detect failures in mechanical water meter devices, we have learnt that a sensible deterioration of the prediction accuracy can occur if one tries to train a deep learning model by adding specific device descriptors, based on categorical data. This can happen because of an excessive increase in the dimensions of the data, with a correspondent loss of statistical significance. After several unsuccessful experiments conducted with alternative methodologies that either permit to reduce the data space dimensionality or employ more traditional machine learning algorithms, we changed the training strategy, reconsidering that categorical data, in the light of a Pareto analysis . In essence, we used those categorical descriptors, not as an input on which to train our deep learning model, but as a tool to give a new shape to the dataset, based on the Pareto rule. With this data adjustment, we trained a more performative deep learning model able to detect defective water meter devices with a prediction accuracy in the range 87–90%, even in the presence of categorical descriptors.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-021-00428-8,springer

For this purpose, reflectivity data from Dual Polarization Ground Radar (GR) maintained by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) at the IMD Delhi site is utilized. IMD Delhi has collected radar data during Continental Tropical Convergence Zone (CTCZ) programme from 2011 to 2013. The present study utilizes monsoon data collected during 4 months, namely, June, July, August, and September (JJAS) from the year 2013. The GR observables are first converted from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates and then spatially aligned with TRMM PR data at a near-real-time to a common volume. It was found that in all the overpass cases, IMD’s GR reflectivity has a positive bias when compared with TRMM PR. A methodology is proposed to ‘correct’ the GR reflectivity data by considering TRMM PR data as ‘truth’ using a neural network-based approach. A supervised learning algorithm based on the back-propagation neural network is used for this purpose. Ground radar reflectivity is fed as input to the network, while the TRMM PR reflectivity is the target. The trained network is then tested for its performance against data which is not used as part of the training process. The present methodology demonstrates the match up of uncalibrated ground radar measured reflectivity and a well-calibrated space-borne radar. Highlights IMD’s ground radar data from CTCZ campaign during the monsoon of 2013 is utilized for Intercomparison study with TRMM PR observations. IMD’s ground radar and TRMM PR reflectivity observations are spatially aligned within minimum volume required to produce spatially coincident sample. Non-parametric based approach using ANN is used to reduce the difference between the two instruments. With the ANN training, the correlation coefficient (RMSE) between the observations made by the two instruments increased (decreased) from 0.45 (15.77 dBZ) to 0.79 (4.69 dBZ).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12040-020-01540-8,springer

These methods differ from usual model-based techniques in that they provide only posterior predictions for quantities (time series) of interest, not posterior models with calibrated parameters. DSI methods require a large number ( O (500–1000)) of flow simulations to first be performed on prior geological realizations. Given observed data, posterior predictions for time series of interest, such as well injection or production rates, can then be generated directly. DSI operates in a Bayesian setting and provides posterior samples of the data vector. In this work, we develop and evaluate a new approach for data parameterization in DSI. Parameterization is useful in DSI as it reduces the number of variables to determine in the inversion, and it maintains the physical character of the data variables. The new parameterization uses a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) for dimension reduction, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture to represent flow-rate time series. The RAE-based parameterization is combined with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) for posterior data sample generation. Results are presented for two- and three-phase flows in a 2D channelized system and a 3D multi-Gaussian model. The new DSI RAE procedure, along with several existing DSI treatments, is assessed through detailed comparison to reference rejection sampling (RS) results. The new DSI methodology is shown to consistently outperform existing approaches, in terms of statistical (P_10–P_90 interval and Mahalanobis distance) agreement with RS results. The method is also shown to accurately capture derived quantities which are computed from variables considered directly in DSI. This requires correlation and covariance between variables to be properly captured, and accuracy in these relationships is demonstrated. The RAE-based parameterization developed here is clearly useful in DSI, and it may also find application in other subsurface flow problems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10596-020-10014-1,springer

Traditional vector-based clustering models such as k -means and support vector clustering rely on low-dimensional features representations for identifying patterns and are prone to loss of useful information which is present in spatial structure of the data. To overcome this limitation, tensor-based clustering models can be utilized for identifying relevant patterns in matrix data as they take advantage of structural information present in multi-dimensional framework and reduce computational overheads as well. However, despite these numerous advantages, tensor clustering has still remained relatively unexplored research area. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering framework, termed as Ternary Tree-based Structural Least Squares Support Tensor Clustering (TT-SLSTWSTC), that builds a cluster model as a hierarchical ternary tree, where at each node non-ambiguous data are dealt separately from ambiguous data points using the proposed Ternary Structural Least Squares Support Tensor Machine (TS-LSTWSTM). The TS-LSTWSTM classifier considers the structural risk minimization of data alongside a symmetrical L2-norm loss function. Also, initialization framework based on tensor k -means has been used in order to overcome the instability disseminated by random initialization. To validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, computational experiments have been performed on human activity recognition and image recognition problems. Experimental results show that our method is not only fast but yields significantly better generalization performance and is comparatively more robust in order to handle heteroscedastic noise and outliers when compared to related methods.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10044-020-00902-8,springer

Thus, there is an eminently amodal path of emotional propagation in the mental lexicon. Following these proposals, we present a computational model that emulates a linking mechanism (mapping function) between emotional and amodal representations of words using vector space models, emotional feature-based models, and neural networks. We analyzed three central concepts within the embodiment debate (redundancy, isomorphism, and propagative mechanisms) comparing two alternative hypotheses: semantic neighborhood hypothesis versus specific dimensionality hypothesis. Univariate and multivariate neural networks were trained for dimensional ( N = 11,357) and discrete emotions ( N = 2,266), and later we analyzed its predictions in a test set ( N = 4,167 and N = 875, respectively). We showed how this computational model could propagate emotional responses to words without a direct emotional experience via amodal propagation, but no direct relations were found between emotional rates and amodal distances. Thereby, we found that there were clear redundancy and propagative mechanisms, but no isomorphism should be assumed. Results suggested that it was necessary to establish complex links to go beyond amodal distances of vector spaces. In this way, although the emotional rates of semantic neighborhoods could predict the emotional rates of target words, the mapping function of specific amodal features seemed to simulate emotional responses better. Thus, both hypotheses would not be mutually exclusive. We also showed that discrete emotions could have simpler relations between modal and amodal representations than dimensional emotions. All these results and their theoretical implications are discussed.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.3758/s13421-020-01086-6,springer

The underlying PDEs are morphological and linear scale space PDEs on the homogeneous space $$\mathbb {M}_d$$ M d of positions and orientations. They provide an equivariant, geometrical PDE-design and model interpretability of the network. The network is implemented by morphological convolutions with approximations to kernels solving morphological $$\alpha $$ α -scale-space PDEs, and to linear convolutions solving linear $$\alpha $$ α -scale-space PDEs. In the morphological setting, the parameter $$\alpha $$ α regulates soft max-pooling over balls, whereas in the linear setting the cases $$\alpha = 1/2$$ α = 1 / 2 and $$\alpha = 1$$ α = 1 correspond to Poisson and Gaussian scale spaces respectively.

This paper has two objectives. The first one is to present summarized outcomes of a literature survey and highlight the state-of-the-art for explainability including gaps, challenges, and opportunities for XAI in healthcare industry. For easier comprehension and onboarding to this research field we suggest a synthesized taxonomy for categorizing explainability methods. The second objective is to ask the question if applying a novel way of looking at explainability problem space, through a specific problem/domain lens, and automating that approach in an AutoML similar fashion, would help mitigate the challenges mentioned above. In the literature there is a tendency to look at the explainability of AI from model-first lens, which puts concrete problems and domains aside. For example, the explainability of a patient's survival model is treated the same as explaining a hospital cost procedure calculation.

The dynamic nature of the environment, heterogeneity of transport modes, and the absence of classical traffic rules make realistic microscopic traffic simulation hard problems. Existing multi-agent-based simulations of shared spaces largely use an expert-based approach, combining a symbolic (e.g. rule-based) modelling and reasoning paradigm (e.g. using BDI representations of beliefs and plans) with the hand-crafted encoding of the actual decision logic.

The application of artificial intelligence in the creative space can realize the intelligent management process, intelligent business operation, intelligent online communication, intelligent material management, intelligent personalized information push service, environment and order maintenance intelligence, aiming to create a new type of creative space, further attract creative talents from all walks of life and develop into high-quality creative and entrepreneurial distribution center. The information age environment has provided unprecedented new opportunities and challenges for the creative space. To realize the intelligence of the creative space, we need to do a good job in the following four aspects of the response. First of all, the development of creative space should focus on and break through the key technologies of AI, combine with the needs of users, combine the technological achievements of external artificial intelligence, give full play to artificial intelligence talents and technological advantages, and tap the greatest value of the creative space. Secondly, the foundation and core of the creative space service is all kinds of raw materials, tools and resources of innovative products, and the use of artificial intelligence technology should also serve the resource construction and management of space. By integrating the tool materials required by the founders with modern intelligent analysis, we continue to enrich the variety of materials and lay the resource base for enhancing the creative services of the genesis space. Third, artificial intelligence technology is a new technology, in order to ensure that artificial intelligence technology in the creative space services play a real role, we must strengthen the construction of human resources, the introduction and training of high-end talent has become a new need for intelligent applications. In addition, we can use advanced artificial intelligence equipment to optimize the space planning and management of the Creative Space. Space design should be reasonable science, intelligent space and intelligent products combined, hardware equipment to meet the needs of big data, can support big data storage and computing services and operating systems, etc. In order to adapt to the development and application of artificial intelligence, we should do a good job in artificial intelligence technology, resource intelligent management technology, related personnel integration, intelligent space re-engineering four aspects of the response measures.

There are two categories of RL agents, model-based or model-free agents. In the case of model-free learning, the algorithm learns through trial and error in the target environment in contrast to model-based where the agent train in a learned or known environment instead. Model-free reinforcement learning shows promising results in simulated environments but falls short in the case of real-world environments. This is because trial and error do not fit with the reality where errors are related to an economic burden. On the other hand, Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to exploit a known or learned dynamics model, which substantially increases sample efficiency. This paper focuses on learning a dynamics model and use the learned model to train several model-free algorithms by directly sampling the dynamics model. However, it is challenging to achieve good accuracy on dynamics models for highly complex domains due to stochasticity and compounding noise in the system. A majority of model-based RL focuses on dynamics models that derive policies from observation space. Deriving policies from observation space is problematic because it is often high dimensional with significant complexity. This paper proposes an end-to-end model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for learning model-free algorithms to act in environments without trial and error in the real environment. This method is beneficial for existing installations that employ existing decision-making systems, such as an expert system. The proposed algorithm has the same fundamental learning principles as the Dreaming Variational Autoencoder but is substantially different architecturally. We show that the algorithm is more sample efficient and performs comparably with existing model-free approaches. We also demonstrate how the algorithm is actor agnostic, enabling existing model-free algorithms to operate in a model-based context.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-91100-3_4,springer

Our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art RL method based on a discrete action space and is inline with state-of-the-art supervised regression based methods.

The MGSTAR model is employed to capture the relationship between locations, and the ML model is used to capture nonlinear patterns from the data. There are three ML models used in this study, namely feed-forward neural network (FFNN), deep learning neural network (DLNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). So that there are three hybrid models used in this study, namely TSR-MGSTAR-FFNN, TSR-MGSTAR-DLNN, and TSR-MGSTAR-LSTM.

Lightweight materials of difficult machinability complicate drilling. This is particularly relevant when drilling stack materials, where the machining parameters are determined by the most difficult to machine material layer. To provide reliable rivet connections, drilling in multiple steps, use of minimum quantity lubrication as well as subsequent manual deburring and cleaning are indispensable. Newly developed electrically driven semi-automatic advanced drilling units (ADUs) enable intelligent process layouts and online condition monitoring by evaluating integrated sensor data. Additionally, process parameters can be adapted to suit each material in the stack. In this paper, machine learning is applied to ADU sensor data to predict cutting forces and process conditions based on the internally measured currents of the ADU’s electric motors. The application of machine learning to ADU data is beneficial as drilling in the aerospace industry shows high repeatability and many produced holes, providing a large dataset.

Accordingly, investigating the eye-movement correlates of reading in a machine learning framework could potentially enhance the detection of poor readers. Here, the capability of eye-movement measures in classifying dyslexic and control young adults (24 dyslexic, 24 control) was assessed on eye-tracking data acquired during reading of isolated sentences presented at five inter-letter spacing levels. The set of 65 eye-movement features included properties of fixations, saccades and glissades. Classification accuracy and importance of features were assessed for all spacing levels by aggregating the results of five feature selection methods. Highest classification accuracy (73.25%) was achieved for an increased spacing level, while the worst classification performance (63%) was obtained for the minimal spacing condition. However, the classification performance did not differ significantly between these two spacing levels (p = 0.28). The most important features contributing to the best classification performance across the spacing levels were as follows: median of progressive and all saccade amplitudes, median of fixation duration and interquartile range of forward glissade duration. Selection frequency was even for the median of fixation duration, while the median amplitude of all and forward saccades measures exhibited complementary distributions across the spacing levels.

The first thing created with a new technology is often seen through the lens of art, simply because of the novelty. As the technology diffuses into the culture, the content of the work made with it and the context the work is presented in drive the artistic value over the groundbreaking novelty of the format. For example, the pioneering video artist Nam June Paik created the first video art by simply getting his hands on a Sony Portapack in the mid sixties and recording the first thing he encountered (Meigh-Andrews: A history of video art. Bloomsbury, New York, pp 17–19, 2006 ). The stranglehold on TV content production, controlled by huge corporations within the context of a one-to-many medium, was broken. However, once they became generally available the content captured & produced by camcorders became more important and the form alone could no longer be enough to justify the result as artwork. Art can create contexts for engaging with technology without the pressure of using it for practical means and thus allows technology to be seen from totally new angles, to be imagined in different contexts, and to be questioned from new aesthetic and ethical points of view. We, the artist duo Caitlin & Misha, aim to use technology as a means of creating unique shared experiences and to harness it as a tool for engaging people in deep thinking and feeling about the current trajectory of our culture.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-70099-7_15,springer

This important task can be handled by monitoring housekeeping telemetry time series using anomaly detection (AD) techniques. The success of machine learning methods makes them attractive for AD in telemetry via a semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning consists of learning a reference model from past telemetry acquired without anomalies in the so-called learning step. In a second step referred to as test step, most recent telemetry time-series are compared to this reference model in order to detect potential anomalies. This paper presents an extension of an existing AD method based on a sparse decomposition of test signals on a dictionary of normal patterns. The proposed method has the advantage of accounting for possible relationships between different telemetry parameters and can integrate external information via appropriate weights that allow detection performance to be improved. After recalling the main steps of an existing AD method based on a sparse decomposition Pilastre et al (Sign Proc, 2019 [ 1 ]) for multivariate telemetry data, we investigate a weighted version of this method referred to as W-ADDICT that allows external information to be included in the detection step. Some representative results obtained using an anomaly dataset composed of actual anomalies that occurred on several satellites show the interest of the proposed weighting strategy using external information obtained from the correlation coefficient between the tested data and its decomposition on the dictionary.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-9199-0_15,springer

We want our machine learning model output to maximize the reward given its inputs. Additionally, the model might need to produce a series of correct answers to get an even bigger reward. We motivate this discussion using a cart-mounted pendulum where to get the maximum reward the pendulum must be successively swung back and forth to get a full rotation. Our method for reinforcement learning is known as policy gradients. In policy gradients we transform the reinforcement learning problem into a supervised learning problem where the dependent variables are weighted by the reward during training. This trains the model to produce outputs that maximize the reward and not produce outputs with a small reward. We conclude the chapter with a case study, where we use policy gradients to control the cooling of glass in an industrial process.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-70388-2_9,springer

In contrast, techniques based on agents naturally provide partial design information and enable fine-grained interaction. However, existing agent-based models originate from non-architectural problems, so it is not straightforward to adapt them for spatial design. To address this gap, we present a method to create custom spatial agents that can satisfy architectural requirements. While the method can be adapted to a diversity of representations and goals, we focus on a proof of concept where agents control spatial partitions (represented as polyominoes with no holes) and interact in an environment represented as a grid.

Advance estimation of crop yield is useful for different stakeholders to plan standard agronomical practices, procurement, determine storage availability, transportation, price fixation, and marketing of agricultural products. This estimation can be done by statistical analysis using traditional ground-based study or by using remotely sensed data. The developments in the field of satellite and sensor technologies in the last few decades have established the second method as the most trusted and efficient tool to forecast crop production. Its time and cost-effectiveness with precise estimation capacity ascertain its competence. This chapter presents an exhaustive discussion on the role of these methods (particularly satellite remote sensing) in crop yield estimation. Analysis and transformation of space data to process different vegetation indices and their use in crop production estimation have been detailed. These vegetation indices are generally used as an explanatory variable in different traditional and advanced statistical models. Further, recent advancements in modeling techniques have introduced applications like machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, mobile computing, etc., and thus opened a new dimension in production forecasting processes. This chapter also tried to focus on these rapidly evolving sectors and their possible contribution to the crop yield estimation.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-15-6864-0_6,springer

Although considerable progress has been made in the field of Trustworthy ML (TwML) in the recent past, much of the current characterization of this progress is qualitative. Consequently, decisions about how to address issues of trustworthiness and future research goals are often left to the interested researcher. In this paper, we present the first quantitative approach to characterize the comprehension of TwML research. We build a co-occurrence network of words using a web-scraped corpus of more than 7,000 peer-reviewed recent ML papers—consisting of papers both related and unrelated to TwML. We use community detection to obtain semantic clusters of words in this network that can infer relative positions of TwML topics. We propose an innovative fingerprinting algorithm to obtain probabilistic similarity scores for individual words, then combine them to give a paper-level relevance score. The outcomes of our analysis inform a number of interesting insights on advancing the field of TwML research.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-81854-8_7,springer

The most widely-used indexes cluster data or divide space using hyper-planes. While searching, the mutual distances between objects and the metric properties allow for the pruning of branches with irrelevant data – this is usually implemented by utilizing selected anchor objects called pivots. Recently, we have introduced an alternative to this approach called Learned Metric Index. In this method, a series of machine learning models substitute decisions performed on pivots – the query evaluation is then determined by the predictions of these models. This technique relies upon a traditional metric index as a template for its own structure – this dependence on a pre-existing index and the related overhead is the main drawback of the approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven variant of the Learned Metric Index, which organizes the data using their descriptors directly, thus eliminating the need for a template. The proposed learned index shows significant gains in performance over its earlier version, as well as the established indexing structure M-index.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-89657-7_7,springer

Undesired user behaviour and user-generated content in the online environment (mostly on social media) can have various forms, probably, the most harmful is the creation and spreading of false information (e.g., fake news) and using abusive language (e.g. hate speech).

Then, use COMSOL and matlab to build a transformer digital space model, correspondingly set the fault, obtain the simulation sample set, and form a fuzzy mirror space. Then, the sample data in the two spaces is pre-processed by feature extraction and fused with each other to obtain the virtual and real twin spaces.

These similarity spaces are typically obtained through multidimensional scaling (MDS), which converts human dissimilarity ratings for a fixed set of stimuli into a spatial representation. One can distinguish metric MDS (which assumes that the dissimilarity ratings are interval or ratio scaled) from nonmetric MDS (which only assumes an ordinal scale). In our first study, we show that despite its additional assumptions, metric MDS does not necessarily yield better solutions than nonmetric MDS. In this chapter, we furthermore propose to learn a mapping from raw stimuli into the similarity space using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to generalize the similarity space to unseen inputs.

However, recent studies demonstrate that using unnoticeable, artificially-crafted perturbations on graph structure can drastically damage the performance of GNNs. Hence, developing robust algorithms to defend poisoning attacks is of great significance. A natural idea to defend them is to delete perturbed edges from a poisoned graph and several efforts have been taken. However, current works either adopt specific threshold as a criteria to filter out poisoned effect for particular graphs or design quite complicated framework with higher time consumption, which can’t well be scablable in practice. Thus in this work, we first investigate the distinction of perturbed edges and normal edges behaved on metric space, then design a defense strategy, called MD-GNN based on Jaccard similarity. Its core principle is to discern the perturbed edges via deleting those edges with lower metric values. Besides, to preserve the valuable information of graph structure and avoid the appearance of the single node during deleting process, MD-GNN deploy the minimum connectivity principle as the terminated condition. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that MD-GNN can effectively preserve state-of-the-art performance of GNNs in the face of poisoning attacks with less time consumption.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-88052-1_4,springer

Then, for each sample, the error gradient is propagated backward in the network, and the weights are adjusted to minimise this error. However, the bandwidth between the satellite and its ground control centre is very narrow. Furthermore, the quality of photographs can be altered by a wide variety of factors including clouds, fumes, shadows, and planes. Thus, one might want to avoid congesting the already limited bandwidth with such useless images. The main idea is to pre-process the images onboard the satellite, automatically deciding whether a photograph is exploitable and worth sending to the ground. To do so, Neural Network applications can be deployed on a low-power FPGA, such as the low-power image processing oriented Tulipp platform. In this use-case, a Hybrid Neural Network architecture developed for satellite applications is adapted to the Tulipp EMC2-ZU3EG board, to serve as a use-case for the Tulipp project and demonstrate the possibilities of the board in real-world applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-53532-2_12,springer

Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies.

We compared the performance of four novelty detection methods—Reed Xiaoli (RX) detectors, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)—and the ability of each method to provide explanatory visualizations to help scientists understand and trust predictions made by the system. We show that pixel-wise RX and autoencoders trained with structural similarity (SSIM) loss can detect morphological novelties that are not detected by PCA, GANs, and mean squared error autoencoders, but that the latter methods are better suited for detecting spectral novelties—i.e., the best method for a given setting depends on the type of novelties that are sought.

Then, an adaptive NN controller is designed by using two NNs to compensate for the lumped uncertainties caused by parametric uncertainties and external disturbances and the input nonlinearities, respectively. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of the whole closed-loop system is provided. The proposed adaptive NN controller is structurally simple and model-independent, which makes the controller affordable for practical applications. In addition, the proposed adaptive NN controller can guarantee the position and velocity tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods about zero even in the presence of parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and input nonlinearities. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are really limited existing controllers can achieve such excellent performance in the same conditions. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control method.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s40430-020-02652-4,springer

Recently, we have developed a pore-scale finite volume solver (PFVS) to directly solve for flow on micro-CT images and predict permeability of digital cores. The solver assigns a local conductivity to each voxel based on geometrical and topological constraints. The local conductivity term in PFVS is conventionally calculated by an iterative local scanning algorithm, where the number of iterations depends on the size of the largest flow channel. This can increase the computation time of PFVS significantly if the largest flow channel is reasonably large. In this paper, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict local conductivity for each voxel, thus bypassing the iterative algorithm while also preserving the mass conservation in the system by still solving for flow using conventional methods. The network is trained to convert segmented binary images of rocks into a numerical map required for flow simulation by the use of paired image-to-image translation using a ResNet-Style architecture. Comparison of the generated and original coefficient maps shows that the average error is within 1% over the 3D pore geometries used in this study. Then, we compare the absolute permeability results obtained from the original PFVS and the CNN-PFVS and the errors are within 20% with the average of 13.8%. Machine learning improves the computation time significantly especially on the images with large domain size and flow channels. On the samples tested, the speedup factor is 10 times using CNN compared to iterative calculations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11242-020-01466-1,springer

Real neural systems operate in time and use the time to code external stimuli of various kinds to produce a uniform internal data representation that can be used for further neural computations. This paper shows how it can be done using special receptors and neurons which use the time to code external data as well as internal results of computations. If neural processes take different time, the activation time of neurons can be used to code the results of computations. Such neurons can automatically find data associated with the given inputs. In this way, we can find the most similar objects represented by the network and use them for recognition or classification tasks. Conducted research and results prove that time space, temporal coding, and temporal neurons can be used instead of data feature space, direct use of input data, and classic artificial neurons. Time and temporal coding might be an important branch for the development of future artificial neural networks inspired by biological neurons.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-30493-5_56,springer

A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-22559-9_17,springer

Conventional models of perception construe such prediction to occur either at the level of inference and detection (predictive coding) or in the learning of sensory and motor interdependencies (sensorimotor contingency).

As a result, these systems are not able to rapidly adapt to changing rules and constraints in the environment. This is unlike humans, who are usually able to learn with only a handful of experiences. This hampers the deployment of, say, an adaptive robot that can learn and act rapidly in the ever-changing environment of a home, office, factory, or disaster area. Thus, it is necessary for an AI or robotic system to achieve human performance not only in terms of the “level” or “score” (e.g., success rate in classification, score in Atari game playing, etc.) but also in terms of the speed with which the level or score can be achieved. In contrast with earlier DeepMind’s effort on Atari games, in which they demonstrated the ability of a deep reinforcement learning system to learn and play the games at human level in terms of score, we describe a system that is able to learn causal rules rapidly in an Atari game environment and achieve human-like performance in terms of both score and time .",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-24265-7_3,springer

We model the search for the targets as a stochastic procedure that draws boxes using some distribution S . We derive first a general expression on the expected number of misses $$\text {E}[Z]$$ E [ Z ] made by the search procedure in terms of H and S . We then obtain an expression for an optimal distribution $$S^{*}$$ S ∗ to minimise $$\text {E}[Z]$$ E [ Z ] .

A prominent model for image morphing originally proposed by Trouvé, Younes and coworkers is image metamorphosis. Here, the space of images is endowed with a Riemannian metric that separately quantifies the contributions due to transport and image intensity variations along a transport path. Geodesic curves in this Riemannian space of images give rise to morphing transitions. The classical metamorphosis model considers images as square-integrable functions on some image domain and thus is non-sensitive to image features such as sharp interfaces or fine texture patterns. To resolve this drawback, we treat images not as intensity maps, but rather as maps into some feature space that encode local structure information. In the simplest case, color intensities are such feature vectors. To appropriately treat local structures and semantic information, deep convolutional neural network features are investigated. The resulting model is formulated directly in terms of a variational time discretization developed for the classical metamorphosis model by Berkels, Effland and Rumpf.

First, the bottom-up activation process is used to generate saliency maps and to identify salient objects. Second, perceptual objects, defined in the context of descriptive topological spaces, are identified and associated with feature vectors obtained from a VGG deep learning convolutional neural network. Lastly, the top-down activation process makes decisions on whether the object of interest is present in a given image through the use of descriptive patterns within the context of a descriptive topological space.

However, manual annotation of lesions can be challenging, time-consuming and subject to observer bias. Automated detection methods often need voxel-wise annotations for training. We propose a novel approach for automated lesion detection that can be trained on scans only annotated with a dot per lesion instead of a full segmentation. From the dot annotations and their corresponding intensity images we compute various distance maps (DMs), indicating the distance to a lesion based on spatial distance, intensity distance, or both. We train a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to predict these DMs for unseen intensity images. The local optima in the predicted DMs are expected to correspond to lesion locations. We show the potential of this approach to detect enlarged perivascular spaces in white matter on a large brain MRI dataset with an independent test set of 1000 scans. Our method matches the intra-rater performance of the expert rater that was computed on an independent set.

ACL injury alters knee kinematics and usually links to the alternation of gait patterns. The aim of this study is to develop a new method to distinguish between gait patterns of patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficient (ACL-D) knees and healthy controls with ACL-intact (ACL-I) knees based on nonlinear features and neural networks. Therefore ACL injury will be automatically and objectively detected. Methods First knee rotation and translation parameters are extracted and phase space reconstruction (PSR) is employed. The properties associated with the gait system dynamics are preserved in the reconstructed phase space. For the purpose of classification of ACL-D and ACL-I knee gait patterns, three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance computation has been used. These measured parameters show significant difference in gait dynamics between the two groups and have been utilized to form a feature set. Neural networks are then constructed to identify gait dynamics and are utilized as the classifier to distinguish between ACL-D and ACL-I knee gait patterns based on the difference of gait dynamics between the two groups. Results Experiments are carried out on a database containing 18 patients with ACL injury and 28 healthy controls to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the twofold and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation styles, the correct classification rates for ACL-D and ACL-I knees are reported to be 91.3 $$\%$$ % and 95.65 $$\%$$ % , respectively. Conclusion Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate that gait alterations in the presence of ACL deficiency can be detected with superior performance.

We illustrate these Bayesian methods by applying them to test the extent to which differences in intuitive versus deliberate decision style are associated with differences in IGT performance. The results show that intuitive and deliberate decision-makers behave similarly on the IGT, and the modeling analyses consistently suggest that both groups of decision-makers rely on similar cognitive processes.

To compromise between model accuracy and simplicity, a rigid- exible coupling multi-body model is proposed as the full model of the tethered space-tug. More specifically, the tug and the towed target are assumed as rigid bodies, whereas the exible tether is approximated as a series of hinged rods. The rods are assumed extensible but incompressible. Then the equations of motion of the multi-body system are derived based on the recursive dynamics algorithm. The attitude motion of the towed target is stabilized by regulating the thrust on the tug, whereas the tether-tension-caused perturbation to the tug's attitude motion is eliminated by the control torque on the tug. The regulated thrust is achieved by first designing an optimal control trajectory considering the simplified system model with constraints for both state variables and control input. Then the trajectory is tracked using a neural-network-based terminal sliding-mode controller. The radial basis function neural network is used to estimate the unknown nonlinear difference between the simple model and the full model, while the terminal sliding-mode controller ensures the rapid tracking control of the target's attitude motion. Thrust saturation and tether slackness avoidance are also considered. Finally, numerical simulations prove the effectiveness of the proposed controller using the regulated thrust.

While accumulating studies highlight expert-level performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on focused classification tasks, most studies rely on probability distribution scores with empirically defined cutoff values based on post-hoc analysis. More generalizable tools that allow humans to visualize histology-based deep learning inferences and decision making are scarce. Results Here, we leverage t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce dimensionality and depict how CNNs organize histomorphologic information. Unique to our workflow, we develop a quantitative and transparent approach to visualizing classification decisions prior to softmax compression. By discretizing the relationships between classes on the t-SNE plot, we show we can super-impose randomly sampled regions of test images and use their distribution to render statistically-driven classifications. Therefore, in addition to providing intuitive outputs for human review, this visual approach can carry out automated and objective multi-class classifications similar to more traditional and less-transparent categorical probability distribution scores. Importantly, this novel classification approach is driven by a priori statistically defined cutoffs. It therefore serves as a generalizable classification and anomaly detection tool less reliant on post-hoc tuning.

It outperforms classical hierarchical clustering algorithms that carry a considerable tendency to produce erroneous results. To facilitate the application of the ESOM/U-matrix method in biomedical research, we introduce the interactive R-based bioinformatics tool “Umatrix”, which enables valid identification of a biologically meaningful cluster structure in the data by training a Kohonen-type self-organizing map followed by interface-guided interactive clustering on the emergent U-matrix map. Results The ability to detect clinical relevant subgroups was applied to a data set comprising plasma concentrations of d = 25 lipid markers including endocannabinoids, lysophosphatidic acids, ceramides and sphingolipids acquired from n  = 100 patients with Parkinson's disease and n = 100 controls. Following ESOM training, clear data structures in the high-dimensional data space were observed on the U-matrix, allowing separation of patients from controls almost perfectly. When the data structure was destroyed by Monte-Carlo random resampling, the U-matrix became unstructured and patients and controls were mixed. Obtained results are biologically plausible and supported by empirical evidence of a regulation of several classes of lipids in Parkinson's disease. Conclusions Sophisticated analysis of structures in biomedical data provides a basis for the mechanistic interpretation of the observations and facilitates subsequent analyses focusing on hypothesis testing. The freely available R library “Umatrix” provides an interactive tool for broader application of unsupervised machine learning on complex biomedical data.",https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s41044-018-0032-1,springer

To prove the availability and effectiveness, we use autonomous mission planning problems of the spacecraft, which is a sophisticated system with complex subsystems and constraints as an example. Simulation results have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) are usable for planning problems.

The core algorithms process image sequences generated by ground-based telescopes and conduct: (1) image quality classification for data cleaning, (2) stream-based key-object identification and anomaly detection, and (3) efficient query processing on large image sequence repositories. Our goal is to design or adopt algorithms that handle the domain-specific image streams most efficiently and effectively.

Over the last decades, many image retrieval systems were based on image representation as a set of extracted low-level features such as color, texture and shape. Then, systems calculate similarity metrics between features in order to find similar images to a query image. The disadvantage of this approach is that images visually and semantically different may be similar in the low level feature space. So, it is necessary to develop tools to optimize retrieval of information. Integration of vector space models is one solution to improve the performance of image retrieval. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective retrieval framework which includes a vectorization technique combined with a pseudo relevance model. The idea is to transform any similarity matching model (between images) to a vector space model providing a score. A study on several methodologies to obtain the vectorization is presented.

The proposed Neuro-SM also considers dynamic current mapping besides voltage mappings. In this way, the proposed Neuro-SM generalizes the previously published Neuro-SM methods and has the potential to produce a more accurate model of microwave devices with more dynamics and nonlinearity. A new formulation and new sensitivity analysis technique are derived to train the general Neuro-SM with dc, small-, and large-signal data. A new gradient-based training algorithm is also proposed to speed up the training.

Furthermore, the k -space sampling patterns of TWIST imaging have been especially designed for a generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) reconstruction. Therefore, the number of shared frames cannot be reduced to provide a reconstructed image with better temporal resolution. The purpose of this study is to improve the temporal resolution of TWIST using a novel k -space deep learning approach.

Our method is based on the Automap reconstruction method, which directly reconstructs high quality MR images from k-space using deep learning. Our main methodological contribution is the addition of an adversarial element to this architecture, in which the quality of image reconstruction (the generator) is increased by using a discriminator. We train the reconstruction network to automatically correct for motion-related artefacts using synthetically corrupted CMR k-space data and uncorrupted reconstructed images. Using 25000 images from the UK Biobank dataset we achieve good image quality in the presence of synthetic motion artefacts, but some structural information was lost.

And the typical channel decoding strategy is simply discarding the error data block. All of this results in the potential loss of the transmission performance. Due to the low encoding complexity and error-tolerance ability of the compressed sensing (CS), to improve the image transmission performance, this paper proposes a joint source-channel error protection transmission scheme based on CS for space image transmission.

The MLP learns the relationship between 1D IFT of undersampled k-space which is transformed along the frequency-encoding direction and the target fully-sampled image. The MLP is trained line by line rather than by a whole image, because each frequency-encoding line of the 1D IFT of k-space is not correlated with each other. It can dramatically decrease the number of parameters to be learned because the number of input/output pixels decrease from N^2 to N. The next CNN learns the relationship between an estimated image of the MLP and the target fully-sampled image to reduce remaining artifacts in the image domain. The proposed deep-learning algorithm (i.e., the combination of the MLP and the CNN) exhibited superior performance over a single MLP and a single CNN.

It is necessary to classify them to handle them appropriately. Although many studies have been conducted to classify noise, they suffered some problems: the difficulty in extracting features, a small amount of data to train a classifier, and less robustness to background noise. This paper proposes a method called transferred encoder-decoder generative adversarial networks (tedGAN) which solves the problems. Deep auto-encoder (DAE) compresses and reconstructs the audio data for capturing the features of them. The decoder network is transferred to the generator of GAN so as to make the process of training generator more stable. Because the generator and the discriminator of GAN are trained at the same time, the capacity of extracting features is enhanced, and a knowledge space of the data is expanded with a small amount of data. The discriminator to classify whether the input is the real or fake BSR noises is transferred again to the classifier; then it is finally trained to classify the BSR noises. The classifier yields the accuracy of 95.15%, which outperforms other machine learning models. We analyze the model with t-SNE algorithm to investigate the misclassified data.

One application of online novelty detection is First Story Detection (FSD) which attempts to find the very first story about a new topic, e.g. the first news report discussing the “Beast from the East” hitting Ireland. Although hundreds of FSD models have been developed, the vast majority of these only aim at improving the performance of the detection for some specific dataset, and very few focus on the insight of novelty itself. We believe that online novelty detection, framed as an unsupervised learning problem, always requires a clear definition of novelty. Indeed, we argue the definition of novelty is the key issue in designing a good detection model. Within the context of FSD, we first categorise online novelty detection models into three main categories, based on different definitions of novelty scores, and then compare the performances of these model categories in different features spaces. Our experimental results show that the challenge of FSD varies across novelty scores (and corresponding model categories); and, furthermore, that the detection of novelty in the very popular Word2Vec feature space is more difficult than in a normal frequency-based feature space because of a loss of word specificity.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-030-03493-1_12,springer

Standards for development and verification of manned aircraft are either only partially applicable or resulting safety and verification efforts are unrealistic in practice due to the higher level of autonomy required by unmanned aircraft. Machine learning techniques are hard to interpret for a human and their outcome is strongly dependent on the training data. This work presents the current certification practices in unmanned aviation in the context of autonomy and artificial intelligence.

Moreover, most data available on shared databases are represented by sequences and graphs, thus demanding the definition of meaningful dissimilarity measures between patterns, which are often non-metric in nature. Especially in such cases, evolutive and fully automatic machine learning systems are mandatory for dealing with parametric dissimilarity measures and/or for performing suitable feature selection Feature selection .

Brain has no algorithm running, how does it make decision? Making a decision by building a scientific theory means predicting future from a given set of events; here, we propose to do that by using a pattern of all possible choices a given set of events could be grouped. This pattern is like space–time metric of astrophysics. When we convert any event into a 3D topological shape changing with time, those shapes are fed into this pattern of event-groups namely, phase prime metric. The output is another changing shape that links all possible unknown patterns that could happen in future; so, without any algorithm we can analyze big data and run a robot. We reject Turing’s machine. For frequency fractal computing using time crystal, information is not “bit,” but a unique time crystal, which is life-like. These crystals holding geometric shape self-assemble to create a clocking topology of phase. To convert information into a 3D geometric structure it follows our phase prime metric.

This is feasible through an automatic system equipped with a camera on the dashboard of the vehicle, capable of detecting the road sign and alarming the driver. This chapter’s main objective is the development of an adequate and robust Traffic Signs Recognition system functioning independently of lighting situations.

It extracts the relevant red and blue regions in the image with limit values of Bounding Boxes (BB). After object extraction, the sign’s shape is classified by an artificial neural network (ANN). Road signs are classified according to their shape characteristics, as triangular, squared and circular shapes. The classified circular and triangular shapes are passed on to the second ANN in the third phase. These identify the pictogram of the road sign.

This chapter introduces a new methodology for chaotic time series modeling of chemical sensor observations in embedded phase space. This method realizes a long-term prediction of sensor baseline and drift based on phase space reconstruction (PSR) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network. PSR can memory all of the properties of a chaotic attractor and clearly show the motion trace of a time series; thus, PSR makes the long-term drift prediction using RBF neural network become possible. Experimental observation data of three metal oxide semiconductor sensors in a year demonstrates the obvious chaotic behavior through the Lyapunov exponents.

This paper proposed a cost-sensitive majority weighted minority oversampling strategy to address the imbalanced MWL data classification problem. Both the inter-class and intra-class imbalance problems are considered. For the former, imbalance ratio is defined to determine the number of the synthetic samples in the minority class. The latter problem is addressed by assigning different weights to borderline samples in the minority class based on the distance and density meaures of the sample distribution. Furthermore, multi-label classifier is designed based on an ensemble of binary classifiers. The results of analyzing 21 imbalanced UCI multi-class datasets showed that the proposed approach can effectively cope with the imbalanced classification problem in terms of several performance metrics including geometric mean (G-mean) and average accuracy (ACC). Moreover, the proposed approach was applied to the analysis of the EEG data of eight experimental participants subject to fluctuating levels of mental workload. The comparative results showed that the proposed method provides a competing alternative to several existing imbalanced learning algorithms and significantly outperforms the basic/referential method that ignores the imbalance nature of the dataset.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s10111-017-0447-x,springer

In this data set, each data point is presented by multiple different views. In this paper, we propose a novel method for this problem. This method is based on two assumptions. The first assumption is that each data point has an intact feature vector, and each view is obtained by a linear transformation from the intact vector. The second assumption is that the intact vectors are discriminative, and in the intact space, we have a linear classifier to separate the positive class from the negative class. We define an intact vector for each data point, and a view-conditional transformation matrix for each view, and propose to reconstruct the multiple view feature vectors by the product of the corresponding intact vectors and transformation matrices. Moreover, we also propose a linear classifier in the intact space, and learn it jointly with the intact vectors. The learning problem is modeled by a minimization problem, and the objective function is composed of a Cauchy error estimator-based view-conditional reconstruction term over all data points and views, and a classification error term measured by hinge loss over all the intact vectors of all the data points. Some regularization terms are also imposed to different variables in the objective function.

Information on regional spatial pattern of soil water storage (SWS) and its relationship with environmental factors is important for optimal water management and vegetation restoration in China’s Loess Plateau (CLP) region. State-space approach and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to analyze spatial variability of SWS in the CLP region. Materials and methods SWS in the 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, and 4–5 m soil layers was measured during the period from June 2013 to September 2015 at 86 locations along a 860 km long south–north transect of CLP. Results and discussion The analysis showed that SWS in the 5 m soil profile generally decreased with increasing latitude, driven by decreasing precipitation and soil–water holding capacity. Using various combinations of variables, the state-space model gave a better spatial pattern of SWS than the ANN approach. The best state-space approach, which included clay content, mean annual precipitation, and slope gradient, explained 96.0% of the total variation in SWS. Then, the best ANN approach explained only 76.2% of the variation. Clay content, mean annual precipitation, and slope gradient was the most effective combination for large-scale estimation of SWS under the state-space approach. Conclusions The state-space model was recommended as an effective method for analyzing large-scale spatial patterns of soil water using soil, climatic, and topographic properties in the CLP region.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11368-016-1626-8,springer

Due to its quantitative (volume and velocity) and qualitative (variety) challenges, big data to the users resembles something like “the elephant to the blind men”. It is imperative to enact a major paradigm shift in data mining and learning tools so that information from diversified sources must be integrated together to unravel information hidden in the massive and messy big data, so that, metaphorically speaking, it would let the blind men “see” the elephant. This talk will address yet another vital “V”-paradigm: “Visualization”. Visualization tools are meant to supplement (instead of replace) the domain expertise (e.g. a cardiologist) and provide a big picture to help users formulate critical questions and subsequently postulate heuristic and insightful answers. For big data, the curse of high feature dimensionality is causing grave concerns on computational complexity and over-training. In this talk, we shall explore various projection methods for dimension reduction - a prelude to visualization of vectorial and non-vectorial data. A popular visualization tool for unsupervised learning is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA aims at the best recoverability of the original data in the Euclidean Vector Space (EVS). However, PCA is not effective for supervised and collaborative learning environment. Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA), basically a supervised PCA, can be derived via a notion of Canonical Vector Space (CVS). The signal subspace components of DCA are associated with the discriminant distance/power (related to the classification effectiveness) while the noise subspace components of DCA are tightly coupled with the recoverability and/or privacy protection. DCA enjoys two major merits: First, because the rank of the signal subspace is limited by the number of classes, DCA can effectively support classification using a relatively small dimensionality (i.e. high compression). Second, in DCA, the eigenvalues of the noise-space are ordered according to their corresponding reconstruction errors and can thus be used to control recoverability or anti-recoverability by applying respectively an negative or positive ridge. Via DCA, individual data can be highly compressed before being uploaded to the cloud, and thus better enabling privacy protection. In many practical scenarios, additional privacy protection can be incorporated by allowing individual participants to selectively hide some personal features. The classification of masked data calls for a kernel approach to Incomplete Data Analysis (KAIDA). More specifically, we extend PCA/DCA to their kernel variants. The success of kernel machines hinges upon the kernel function adopted to characterize the similarity of pairs of partially-specified vectors. Simulations on the HAR dataset confirm that DCA far outperforms PCA, both in their conventional or kernelized variants. For the latter, the visualization/classification results suggest favorable performance by the proposed partial correlation kernels over the imputed RBF kernel. In addition, the visualization results further points to a potentially promising approach via multiple kernels such as combining an imputed Gaussian RBF kernel and a non-imputed partial correlation kernel.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s11042-015-2959-9,springer

However, in many applications such as advertisement, recommendation systems, social networks, customer relationship management, and clinical prediction, the users need not only accurate prediction, but also suggestions on actions to achieve a desirable goal (e.g., high ads hit rates) or avert an undesirable predicted result (e.g., clinical deterioration). Existing works for extracting such actionability are few and limited to simple models such as a decision tree. The dilemma is that those models with high accuracy are often more complex and harder to extract actionability from. In this paper, we propose an effective method to extract actionable knowledge from additive tree models (ATMs), one of the most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers. We rigorously formulate the optimal actionable planning (OAP) problem for a given ATM, which is to extract an actionable plan for a given input so that it can achieve a desirable output while maximizing the net profit. Based on a state space graph formulation, we first propose an optimal heuristic search method which intends to find an optimal solution. Then, we also present a sub-optimal heuristic search with an admissible and consistent heuristic function which can remarkably improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

Multisensory approaches have been employed to monitor these processes, aiming to use signals to train artificial intelligence systems to perform the task of indicating nonconformities in the tools or the product being manufactured. In this study, three artificial intelligence systems were used to estimate diameter of holes produced in sandwich plates—Ti6Al4V alloy was mounted in AA 2024-T3 alloy—and cutting conditions were selected to simulate a common aircraft fuselage manufacturing process. A multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP ANN), an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network were trained to estimate the diameter of machined holes.

Furthermore, when transferred without further training , solutions evolved on smaller arms retain the fundamental motion model because they simply extend the general kinematic concepts discovered at the original size.

As the state space grows, agent policies become more and more complex and learning slows down. The presence of possibly redundant information is one of the causes of this issue. Current single-agent techniques are already very capable of learning optimal policies in large unknown environments. When multiple agents are present however, we are challenged by an increase of the state space, which is exponential in the number of agents. A solution to this problem lies in the use of Generalized Learning Automata (GLA). In this chapter we will first demonstrate how GLA can help take the correct actions in large unknown environments. Secondly, we introduce a general framework for multi-agent learning, where learning happens on two separate layers and agents learn when to observe each other. Within this framework we introduce a new algorithm, called 2observe, which uses a GLA-approach to distinguish between high risk states where the agents have to take each others presence into account and low risk states where they can act independently.

Pervasive systems can also be improved by smart application of context prediction. This paper addresses subsequent challenge of how to act according to predicted context in order to strengthen the system. Novel reinforcement learning based architecture is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of existing approaches to proactive adaptation. Context spaces theory is used as an example of how existing context awareness systems can be enhanced to achieve proactive adaptation. This recently developed theory addresses problems related to sensors uncertainty and high-level situation reasoning and it can be enhanced to achieve efficient proactive adaptation as well.

Programming by demonstration has been used to instruct a robot, but is limited by the quality of the trace provided by the user. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that can handle continuous spaces, can produce continuous actions and incorporates the user’s intervention to quickly learn optimal policies of tasks defined by the user.

Springer, Heidelberg, 1987 ) and the VARMAX algorithm of Spliid (J Am Stat Assoc 78(384):843–849, 1983 ) within a geno-mathematical framework towards optimal parametric conditions/search intervals. Both algorithms were implemented as an integrated support library for a general computational platform, the Genetic Hybrid Algorithm (GHA), where some key parameters of the algorithms are defined in a search process utilizing a mixed geno-mathematical search technique. The empirical results of our tests using real economic data from the European stock market are encouraging. Specifically, the information criteria used in the VARMAX-search (Vector Autoregressive Moving Average algorithm with Exogenous variables) algorithm tend to favor parsimonious model representations automatically. Furthermore, the state space algorithm captures almost the same dynamics as the complex VARMAX-model estimated in the study. Both algorithms have encouraging in sample properties. When generating k -steps forecasts out-of-sample, k  > 1, the state space algorithm seems to deteriorate faster than the VARMAX algorithm, however. The results suggest that more empirical testing is needed, especially in different situations with different degrees of model order and stationarity conditions, in order to provide more evidence on the suitability of the competing methods in particular cases. We demonstrated that the Genetic Hybrid Algorithm can be used as a generic platform for parametric search in vector valued time series modelling.

It indicates the intensity of magnetic storm, similarly to Dst index but with much higher time-resolution. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) of Nonlinear Auto Regressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) has been developed to predict SYM-H index from solar wind and IMF data. In comparison with usual BP and Elman network, the new NRAX model shows much better prediction capability. For 15 testing great storms including 5 super-storms of Min. SYM-H < −200 nT, the cross-correlation of SYM-H indices between NARX network predicted and really observed is 0.91 as a whole. For the 5 individual super-storms, the lowest coefficients is 0.91 relating to the super-storm of March 2001 with Min. SYM-H of −434 nT; while for the two super-storms with Min. SYM-H ranging from −300 nT to −400 nT, the correlations reach as high as 0.93 and 0.96 respectively. The remarkable improvement of the model performance can be attributed to such a key feedback from the network output of SYM-H with a suitable length (about 120 min) to the input, which implies that some information on the quasi real-time ring currents with a proper length of history does its work in the prediction. It tells us that, in addition to the direct driving by solar wind and IMF, the own status of the ring current plays an important role in its evolution especially for recovery phase and must properly be considered in storm-time SYM-H prediction by ANN.

The approach developed here is based on some fundamental ideas proposed by A. Kolmogorov, R. Thom, M. Gromov, L. Valiant, L. Van Valen, and others. Under some conditions it is shown that almost all systems from this class with fixed parameters are unstable in the following sense: the probability P _ t to leave Π within the time interval [0, t ] tends to 1 as t  → ∞. However, it is allowed to change these parameters sometimes (“evolutionary” case), then it may happen that P _ t  < 1 − δ  < 1 for all t (“stable evolution”). Furthermore, we study the properties of such a stable evolution assuming that the system parameters are encoded by a dicsrete code. This allows us to apply complexity theory, coding, algorithms, etc. Evolution is a Markov process of modification of this code. Under some conditions we show that the stable evolution of unstable systems possesses the following general fundamental property: the relative Kolmogorov complexity of the code cannot be bounded by a constant as t  → ∞. For circuit models, we define complexity characteristics of these circuits. We find that these complexities also have a tendency to increase during stable evolution.

The NGDC flares catalogue and the SOHO/LASCO CME catalogue are processed to associate X and M-class flares with CMEs based on timing information. Automated systems are created to process and associate years of flare and CME data, which are later arranged in numerical-training vectors and fed to machine-learning algorithms to extract the embedded knowledge and provide learning rules that can be used for the automated prediction of CMEs. Properties representing the intensity, flare duration, and duration of decline and duration of growth are extracted from all the associated (A) and not-associated (NA) flares and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine-learning use. The machine-learning algorithms Cascade Correlation Neural Networks (CCNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used and compared in our work. The machine-learning systems predict, from the input of a flare’s properties, if the flare is likely to initiate a CME. Intensive experiments using Jack-knife techniques are carried out and the relationships between flare properties and CMEs are investigated using the results.

Unfortunately, today hardly any general applicable set of image processing methods exist to support biomedical experts with a fully or partially automated analysis of micrographs to support and strengthen his experiments. Hence, currently much image analysis and interpretation in this field has to be done manually. Otherwise, a background in image processing is needed to adopt available image analysis tools to the desired task, or to write scripts in image-processing toolboxes. Thus, using cervical nuclei as a first example, a novel image processing scheme is suggested to bridge the so-called “semantical gap” between the analytical question of the biomedical experts on one side and the required set of image processing procedures on the other. Within this approach, the biomedical expert interactively annotates the background and foreground pixels (nuclei) on a small subset of micrographs of cervical cells. Using this information, the image processing system can now automatically find the most optimal classifier to separate these two sets of pixels in color space. Within this approach machine-learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbor, KStar, Gaussian Mixture Models, KMeans and Expectation-Maximation have been used and evaluated for the task to separate fore- and background pixels in the color space to yield an automated segmentation approach for cervical nuclei. Thus, the suggested approach is able to “learn” the required segmentation task from the biomedical experts by interactively training the system on a small subset of images. After the self-organization and optimization procedure, the system is capable to apply the learned analysis mechanisms to other micrographs of cervical cells.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-89208-3_146,springer

The performance of ML estimation technique degrades significantly in the case of fractionally spaced (FS) multipath channels where dominant paths are closely spaced with respect to the time resolution of the system.

Network elements are described by excitable space-clamped FitzHugh-Nagumo (SCFHN) neurons with the values of parameters at which no firing activity occurs. It is found that for a given appropriate coupling strength C, there exists a critical fraction of random connections (or randomness) p^*, such that if p > p^* the firing neurons, which are absent in the nearest-neighbor network, occur. The firing activity becomes more frequent as randomness p is further increased. On the other hand, when the p is smaller, there are no active neurons in network, no matter what the value of C is. For a given larger p, there exist optimal coupling strength levels, where firing activity reaches its maximum.

In a given application, X would constitute a feature space. The membership functions of sets in such X are then “membership functionals”, that is, mappings from a vector space to the real line. This paper considers the class Φ of fuzzy sets A , the membership functionals μ_ A of which belong to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) F ( X ) of bounded analytic functionals on X , and satisfy the constraint $$0\,\leqslant \mu (x) \leqslant 1,x \in X$$ . These functionals can be expanded in abstract power series in x , commonly known as Volterra functional series in x . Because of the one-to-one relationship between the fuzzy sets A and their respective μ_ A , one can process the sets A as objects using their μ_ A as intermediaries. Thus the structure of the uncertainty present in the fuzzy sets can be processed in a vector space without descending to the level of processing of vectors in the feature space as usually done in the literature in the field. Also, the framework allows one to integrate human and machine judgments in the definition of fuzzy sets; and to use concepts analogous to probabilistic concepts in assigning membership values to combinations of fuzzy sets. Some analytical and interpretive consequences of this approach are presented and discussed. A result of particular interest is the best approximation $$\hat{\mu}_{A}$$ of a membership functional μ_ A in F ( X ) based on interpolation $$\hat {\mu}_{A} (v^{i}) = u^{i}$$ on a training set {( v ^ i , u ^ i ), i =  1, . . . , q } and under the positivity constraint. The optimal analytical solution comes out in the form of an Optimal Interpolative Neural Network (OINN) proposed by the author in 1990 for best approximation of pattern classification systems in a F ( X ) space setting.

Furthermore, it is proved that local subimage normalization by normalizing the weights is faster than subimage normalization in the spatial domain.

The continuous improvement of computer performance allows for more detailed numerical methods, based on space-time discretisation, to be developed and run for a predictive modelling of complex real systems, reproducing the way their spatial patterns evolve and pointing out the degree of simulation accuracy. In this contribution we present an application of several methods (Geomatics, Neural Networks, Land Cover Modeler and Dinamica EGO) in the tropical training area of Peten, Guatemala. During the last few decades this region, included in the Biosphere Maya reserve, has seen a fast demographic raise and a subsequent uncontrolled pressure on its own geo-resources. The test area can be divided into several sub-regions characterized by different land use dynamics. Understanding and quantifying these differences permits a better approximation of a real system; moreover we have to consider all the physical, socio-economic parameters, which will be of use for representing the complex and sometimes random human impact. Because of the absence of detailed data from our test area, nearly all the information was derived from the image processing of 11 ETM+, TM and SPOT scenes; we studied the past environmental dynamics and we built the input layers for the predictive models. The data from 1998 and 2000 were used during the calibration to simulate the land cover changes in 2003, selected as reference date for the validation.

Intuitively, the new model constrains the learner’s memory not only in how much data may be retained, but also in how long that data may be retained. More specifically, the model requires that, if a learner commits an example x to memory in some stage of the learning process, then there is some subsequent stage for which x no longer appears in the learner’s memory. This model is called temporary example memory ( Tem ) learning. In some sense, it captures the idea that memories fade . Many interesting results concerning the Tem -learning model are presented. For example, there exists a class of languages that can be identified by memorizing k  + 1 examples in the Tem sense, but that can not be identified by memorizing k examples in the Bem sense. On the other hand, there exists a class of languages that can be identified by memorizing just 1 example in the Bem sense, but that can not be identified by memorizing any number of examples in the Tem sense.

Addressing this limitation, this paper presents an active learning algorithm aimed at sampling the feasible paths in the control flow graph. The difficulty comes from both the few feasible paths initially available and the nature of the feasible path concept, reflecting the long-range dependencies among the nodes of the control flow graph.

A summary of notations is presented, which is quite helpful for the sequel. In section 3, mean-field dynamics is developed. The probability distribution characterizing global dynamics is computed. In section 4, some applications of mean-field theory to the prediction of chaotic regime for Analog Formal Random Recurrent Neural Networks (AFRRNN) are displayed. The case of AFRRNN with an homogeneous population of neurons is studied in section 4.1. Then, a two-population model is studied in section 4.2. The occurrence of a cyclo-stationary chaos is displayed using the results of [16]. In section 5, an insight of the application of mean-field theory to IF networks is given using the results of [9].",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1140/epjst/e2007-00059-1,springer

The method is named FMM-RL. The FMM neural network is used to segment the state space of the RL problem. The aim is to solve the “curse of dimensionality” problem of RL. Furthermore, the speed of convergence is improved evidently. Regions of state space serve as the hyperboxes of FMM. The minimal and maximal points of the hyperbox are used to define the state space partition boundaries. During the training of FMM neural network, the state space is partitioned via operations on hyperbox. Therefore, a favorable generalization performance of state space can be obtained. Finally, the method of this paper is applied to learn behaviors for the reactive robot. The experiment shows that the algorithm can effectively solve the problem of navigation in a complicated unknown environment.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-540-72393-6_21,springer

In this task, an offense team attempts to outplay a defense team in order to shoot goals. Half field offense extends keepaway [11], a simpler subtask of RoboCup soccer in which one team must try to keep possession of the ball within a small rectangular region, and away from the opposing team. Both keepaway and half field offense have to cope with the usual problems of RoboCup soccer, such as a continuous state space, noisy actions, and multiple agents, but the latter is a significantly harder multiagent reinforcement learning problem because of sparse rewards, a larger state space, a richer action set, and the sheer complexity of the policy to be learned. We demonstrate that the algorithm that has been successful for keepaway is inadequate to scale to the more complex half field offense task, and present a new algorithm to address the aforementioned problems in multiagent reinforcement learning. The main feature of our algorithm is the use of inter-agent communication, which allows for more frequent and reliable learning updates. We show empirical results verifying that our algorithm registers significantly higher performance and faster learning than the earlier approach. We also assess the contribution of inter-agent communication by considering several variations of the basic learning method.

Starting from a coarse aggregation of the state space, LEAP generates refined partitions whenever it detects an incoherence between the current action values and the actual rewards from the environment. Since in highly stochastic problems the adaptive process can lead to over-refinement, we introduce a mechanism that prunes the macrostates without affecting the learned policy.

The invertible system in which a stochastic web was found in 1999 is re-discussed here. The result shows that the set of images of the borderline actually forms the same stochastic web. The web has two typical local fine structures. Firstly, in some parts of the web the borderline crosses the manifold of hyperbolic points so that the chaotic diffusion is damped greatly; secondly, in other parts of phase space many holes and elliptic islands appear in the stochastic layer. This local structure shows infinite self-similarity. The noninvertible system in which the so-called chaotic quasi-attractor was found in [X.-M. Wang et al., Eur. Phys. J. D 19 , 119 (2002)] is also studied here. The numerical investigation shows that such a chaotic quasi-attractor is confined by the preceding lower order images of the borderline. The mechanism of this confinement is revealed: a forbidden zone exists that any orbit can not visit, which is the sub-phase space of one side of the first image of the borderline. Each order of the images of the forbidden zone can be qualitatively divided into two sub-phase regions: one is the so-called escaping region that provides the orbit with an escaping channel, the other is the so-called dissipative region where the contraction of phase space occurs.",2005-11-16,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1140/epjd/e2005-00309-0,springer

Chapter ConferencePaper,doi:10.1007/11795131_3,Hierarchical Machine Learning – A Learning Methodology Inspired by Human Intelligence,Rough Sets and Knowledge Technology,10.1007/11795131_3,Springer,2006-01-01,"One of the basic characteristics in human problem solving, including learning, is the ability to conceptualize the world at different granularities and translate from one abstraction level to the others easily, i.e., deal with them hierarchically[1]. But computers can only solve problems in one abstraction level generally. This is one of the reasons that human beings are superior to computers in problem solving and learning. In order to endow the computers with the human’s ability, several mathematical models have been presented such as fuzzy set, rough set theories [2, 3]. Based on the models, the problem solving and machine learning can be handled at different grain-size worlds. We proposed a quotient space based model [4, 5] that can also deal with the problems hierarchically. In the model, the world is represented by a semi-lattice composed by a set of quotient spaces: each of them represents the world at a certain grain-size and is denoted by a triplet, ( X , F , f ) where X is a domain, F - the structure of X , f -the attribute of X . In this talk, we will discuss the hierarchical machine learning based on the proposed model. From the quotient space model point of view, a supervised learning (classification) can be regarded as finding a mapping from a low-level feature space to a high-level conceptual space, i.e., from a fine space to its quotient space (a coarse space) in the model. Since there is a big semantic gap between the low-level feature spaces and the conceptual spaces, finding the mapping is quite difficult and inefficiency. For example, it needs a large number of training samples and a huge amount of computational cost generally. In order to reduce the computational complexity in machine learning, the characteristics of human learning are adopted. In human learning, people always use a multi-level learning strategy, including multi-level classifiers and multi-level features, instead of one-level, i.e., learning at spaces with different grain-size. We call this kind of machine learning the hierarchical learning. So the hierarchical learning is a powerful strategy for improving machine learning. Taking the image retrieval as an example, we’ll show how to use the hierarchical learning strategy to the field. Given a query (an image) by a user, the aim of image retrieval is to find a set of similar images from a collection of images. This is a typical classification problem and can be regarded as a supervised learning. The first problem is how to represent an image so that the similar images can be found from the collection of images precisely and entirely. So far in image retrieval, an image was represented by several forms with different grain-size. The finest representation of an image is by an n(n matrix, each of its elements represents a pixel. Using this representation to image retrieval, the precision will be high but the robustness (recall) will be low. Since it has the precise detail of an image, it is sensitive to noises. Therefore, the pixel-based representation was used in image retrieval rarely. The common used representation in image retrieval is the coarsest one, i.e., so called global visual features [6]. Here, an image is represented by a visual feature (a vector) such as color moments, color correlograms, wavelet transforms, Gabor transform, etc. In the coarsest representations, most of the details in an image lose so that the retrieval precision decreases but the robustness (recall) increases. The coarsest representations are suitable for seeking a class of similar images due to their robustness. Therefore, the global visual features were used for image retrieval widely. In order to overcome the low precision introduced by the coarsest representations, global features, the middle-size representation of an image was presented recently such as region-based representation [7]. In the representation, an image is partitioned into several consistent regions and each region is represented by a visual feature (a vector) extracted from the region. The whole image is represented by a set of features (vectors). Since the region-based representation has more details of an image than the global one, the retrieval precision increases but the robustness decreases. Therefore, the quality, including precision and recall, of image retrieval will be improved by using multi-level features. One of the strategies for hierarchical learning is to integrating the features with different grain-size, including the global, the region-based, and the pixel-based features. One of the main goals in hierarchical learning is to reduce the computational complexity. Based on the proposed model we know that the learning cost can be reduced by using a set of multi-level classifiers. Certainly, the set of multi-level classifiers composes a hierarchical learning framework. A set of experimental results in hand-written Chinese character recognition and image retrieval are given to verify the advantage of the approach. Hierarchical learning inspired by human’s learning is one of the methodologies for improving the performances of machine learning.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11795131_3,springer

The task complexity imposes the coordination of several AC submodules, each module being an expert trained in a particular subset of the task. We showed that the classical method where the choice of the expert to train at a given time depends on each expert’s performance suffered from strong limitations. We rather proposed to cluster the continuous state space by an ad hoc method that lacked autonomy and generalization abilities. In the present work we have combined the mixture of experts with self-organizing maps in order to cluster autonomously the experts’ responsibility space. On the one hand, we find that classical Kohonen maps give very variable results: some task decompositions provide very good and stable reinforcement learning performances, whereas some others are unadapted to the task. Moreover, they require the number of experts to be set a priori. On the other hand, algorithms like Growing Neural Gas or Growing When Required have the property to choose autonomously and incrementally the number of experts to train. They lead to good performances, even if they are still weaker than our hand-tuned task decomposition and than the best Kohonen maps that we got. We finally discuss on propositions about what information to add to these algorithms, such as knowledge of current behavior, in order to make the task decomposition appropriate to the reinforcement learning process.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11840541_33,springer

The classifier population codes the current knowledge of the LCS. The evaluation mechanism estimates and propagates rule utility. Based on the estimated utilities, the evolutionary mechanism generates offspring classifiers and deletes less useful classifiers.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-31231-5_3,springer

Approximation spaces used for concept approximation have been initially defined on samples of objects (decision tables) representing partial information about concepts. Such approximation spaces defined on samples are next inductively extended on the whole object universe. This makes it possible to define the concept approximation on extensions of samples. We discuss the role of inductive extensions of approximation spaces in searching for concept approximation. However, searching for relevant inductive extensions of approximation spaces defined on samples is infeasible for compound concepts. We outline an approach making this searching feasible by using a concept ontology specified by domain knowledge and its approximation. We also extend this approach to a framework for adaptive approximation of vague concepts by agents interacting with environments. This paper realizes a step toward approximate reasoning in multiagent systems (MAS), intelligent systems, and complex dynamic systems (CAS).",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11847465_3,springer

Not only is it difficult to model real systems, but often it is unclear what kind of behavior is required. Reinforcement learning (RL) has made progress through direct interaction with the task environment, but it has been difficult to scale it up to large and partially observable state spaces. In recent years, neuroevolution, the artificial evolution of neural networks, has shown promise in tasks with these two properties. This paper introduces a novel neuroevolution method called CoSyNE that evolves networks at the level of weights. In the most extensive comparison of RL methods to date, it was tested in difficult versions of the pole-balancing problem that involve large state spaces and hidden state. CoSyNE was found to be significantly more efficient and powerful than the other methods on these tasks, forming a promising foundation for solving challenging real-world control tasks.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11871842_64,springer

Clustering is an important tool for diversely intelligent systems. So, many works have been researched in the machine learning algorithms. But, some problems are still shown in the clustering. One of them is to determine the optimal number of clusters. In K-means algorithm, the number of cluster K is determined by the art of researchers. Another problem is an over fitting of learning models. The majority of learning algorithms for clustering are not free from the problem. Therefore, we propose a competitive co-evolving support vector clustering. Using competitive co-evolutionary computing, we overcome the over fitting problem of support vector clustering which is a good learning model for clustering. The number of clusters is efficiently determined by our competitive co-evolving support vector clustering.

We assessed the ranking results by using Kendall’s τ _ b as a measure of association between the output of the RLS algorithm and the desired ranking. The values of τ _ b were 0.62, 0.69, and 0.44 for breathing, blood circulation, and pain, respectively.

Beck and E.G.D. Cohen, Physica A 322 , 267 (2003)] is a formalism that aims to deal in a unifying way with a large variety of complex nonequilibrium systems, for which spatio-temporal fluctuations of one intensive variable (“the temperature” 1/β) are supposed to exist. The intuitive explanation provided by Beck for superstatistics is based on the ansatz that the system under consideration, during its evolution, travels within its phase space which is partitioned into cells. Within each cell, the system is described by ordinary Maxwell-Boltzmann statistical mechanics, i.e., its statistical distribution is the canonical one e^-βE, but β varies from cell to cell, with its own probability density f(β). In this work we first address that the explicit inclusion of the density of states in this description is essential for its correctness. The correction is not relevant for developments of the theory, but points to the fact that its correct starting point, as well its meaning, must be found at a more basic level: the pure probability product rule involving the intensive variable β and its conjugate extensive one. The question therefore arises how to assign a meaning to these probabilities for each specific problem. We will see that it is easily answered through Bayesian analysis.

In the previous approaches [1,2] , an optimal similarity transformation is exhaustively searched for to maximize the response of a trained classification model. At best, these approaches only give a rough estimate of the position of a non-rigid shape. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning based approach to achieve a refined shape detection result. We train a model that has the largest response on a reference shape and a smaller response on other shapes. During shape detection, we search for an optimal non-rigid deformation to maximize the response of the trained model on the deformed image block. Since exhaustive searching is inapplicable for a non-rigid deformation space with a high dimension, currently, example based searching is used instead.

In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of such motions (locally in time), when the elastic solid is the linear Kirchhoff elastic material. The solution is found using a topological fixed-point theorem that requires the analysis of a linear problem consisting of the coupling between the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations set in Lagrangian variables and the linear equations of elastodynamics, for which we prove the existence of a unique weak solution. We then establish the regularity of the weak solution; this regularity is obtained in function spaces that scale in a hyperbolic fashion in both the fluid and solid phases.

In the present structure, the multidimensional information, in the form of vectors is processed as such in the network, thus preserving in a simple way all the multidimensional neighbourhood relationships. The projection into the dimensionality of the output space is also carried out within the network. This procedure allows for a simpler processing of multidimensional signals such as multi or hyperspectral cubes as used in remote sensing or colour signals in images, which is the example we present as a test for the algorithm.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11494669_3,springer

Supervised Learning was addressed in 3 papers: (i) multi-output nonparametric regression methods were presented comparing alternative ways to integrate co-response observations; (ii) Peepholing Techniques were adapted for Regression Trees, providing means to reduce the number of continuous variables and the ranges considered for nodes splitting; (iii) a Multi-Layer Perceptron was used to classify vector structures derived using the Law’s Algorithm.

Application domains were very diverse and illustrated the practical utility of the presented methodologies.

The new method is based on the development of a new neural network classifier that combines the advantages of the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) and the Kohonen Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) neural networks. We call the new neural network: Self-Growing and Self-Organized Neural Gas (SGONG). Its main advantage is that it defines the number of the created neurons and their topology in an automatic way. Besides, a new method is proposed for the Estimation of the Most Important of already created Classes (EMIC). The combination of SGONG and EMIC in color images results in retaining the isolated and significant colors with the minimum number of color classes. The above techniques are able to be fed by both color and spatial features. For this reason a similarity function is used for vector comparison. To speed up the entire algorithm and to reduce memory requirements, a fractal scanning sub-sampling technique is used. The method is applicable to any type of color images and it can accommodate any type of color space.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/11578079_100,springer

Most existing methods can only adapt the kernel parameters or the kernel matrix based on empirical data. Recently, Ong et al. introduced the method of hyperkernels which can be used to learn the kernel function directly in an inductive setting [12]. However, the associated optimization problem is a semidefinite program (SDP), which is very computationally expensive even with the recent advances in interior point methods. In this paper, we show that this learning problem can be equivalently reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP), which can then be solved more efficiently than SDPs. Experimental results on both toy and real-world data sets show significant speedup. Moreover, in comparison with the kernel matrix learning method proposed by Lanckriet et al.

Historically, this paradigm has three main threads: production of a training set description, calculus of granules, and interval analysis. This paradigm gains its inspiration from the work of Pawlak on rough set philosophy as a basis for machine learning and from work on data mining and pattern recognition by Swiniarski and others in the early 1990s. The focus of this work is on the production of a training set description and inductive learning using knowledge reduction algorithms. This first thread in rough-neural computing has a strong presence in current neural computing research. The second thread in rough-neural computing has two main components: information granule construction in distributed systems of agents and local parameterized approximation spaces (see Sect. 2.2 and Chap. 3). A formal treatment of the hierarchy of relations of being a part to a degree (also known as approximate rough mereology ) was introduced by Polkow ski and Skowron in the mid-and late-1990s. Approximate rough mereology provides a basis for an agent-based, adaptive calculus of granules. This calculus serves as a guide in designing rough-neural computing systems. A number of touchstones of rough-neural computing have emerged from efforts to establish the foundations for granular computing: cooperating agent, granule, granule measures (e.g., inclusion, closeness), and approximation space parameter calibration. The notion of a cooperating agent in a distributed system of agents provides a model for a neuron. Information granulation and granule approximation define two principal activities of a neuron. Included in the toolbox of an agent (neuron) are measures of granule inclusion and closeness of granules.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-642-18859-6_2,springer

Newly encountered local spaces are classified by the neural network as to how well they match the signatures of the nodes in the topological network. Of equal importance as the correspondence problem is its dual, that of perceptual aliasing which occurs when parts of the environment which appear the same are in fact different. It manifests itself as false positive matches from the neural network classification. Our approach to solving this aspect of the problem is to use the context provide by nodes in the neighbourhood of the (mis)matched node.

A neural network is generated in the space of slew parameters; it may be trained during a preflight period. Known radial basis functions are used to model the process of fast in-flight computation of the optimal reorientation program",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/B:INAM.0000010374.09422.49,springer

              Segmentation of MR and CT Images by Using a Quantiser Neural Network
            ",Neural Computing & Applications,10.1007/s00521-003-0355-2,Springer,2003-06-01,"A Quantiser Neural Network (QNN) is proposed for the segmentation of MR and CT images. Elements of a feature vector are formed by image intensities at one neighbourhood of the pixel of interest. QNN is a novel neural network structure, which is trained by genetic algorithms. Each node in the first layer of the QNN forms a hyperplane (HP) in the input space. There is a constraint on the HPs in a QNN. The HP is represented by only one parameter in d-dimensional input space. Genetic algorithms are used to find the optimum values of the parameters which represent these nodes. The novel neural network is comparatively examined with a multilayer perceptron and a Kohonen network for the segmentation of MR and CT head images. It is observed that the QNN gives the best classification performance with fewer nodes after a short training time.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1007/s00521-003-0355-2,springer

But it is clear that attractors in neural networks will be chaotic unless there is some other ordering principle. Kauffman has suggested that principle may be learning, for example, Hebbian. However, there is a sense in which that cannot be so for kinds of knowing found in Boundary Set S . Among other things, those kinds of knowing are primitive relations between a subject and object where the latter is not a class object. Hebbian learning essentially proceeds by modifying synaptic weight so as to amplify changes throughout a network. Data is presented to a system input layer where the system algorithm operates upon it in terms of local rules, computing an input-output mapping with certain desirable properties.

Using an artificial neural network model of learning we show how detailed learning in narrow fields develops when attention shifting between different sources of stimuli is restricted by familiarity preference. Our model is based on modified Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) supported by the attention shift mechanism. The novelty seeking and the attention shifting restricted by familiarity preference learning modes are investigated for stimuli of low and high dimensionality which requires different techniques to visualise feature maps. To make learning more biologically plausible we project the stimuli onto a unity hyper-sphere. The distance between a stimulus and a weight vector can now be simply measured by the post-synaptic activities. The modified “dot-product” learning law that keeps evolving weights on the surface of the hyper-sphere has been employed.,2003-06-18,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-44989-2_99,springer

By a new net architecture we allow additional information flows between the different outputs and as a sequence we get a better representation of the underlying dynamical system.

In this paper we show that in the binary vector space model, if the initial query vector is 0 , then for any of the four typical similarities (inner product, dice coefficient, cosine coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient), Rocchio's similarity-based relevance feedback algorithm makes at least n mistakes when used to search for a collection of documents represented by a monotone disjunction of at most k relevant features (or terms) over the n -dimensional binary vector space {0, 1}^ n . When an arbitrary initial query vector in {0, 1}^ n is used, it makes at least ( n + k − 3)/2 mistakes to search for the same collection of documents. The linear lower bounds are independent of the choices of the threshold and coefficients that the algorithm may use in updating its query vector and making its classification.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1012730924277,springer

The first step is to appropriately arrange the training order of the instances. It is well known from Psychology that different orders of presentation of the same set of training instances to a human may cause different learning results. This idea is used here for machine learning and an order arrangement scheme is proposed. The second step is to modify a conventional noise-free learning algorithm, thus making it suitable for noisy environment. The generalized version space learning algorithm is then adopted to process the training instances for deriving good concepts.

In this chapter, we will test this premise by defining a granular neural network and testing it on the Iris data set. Our hypothesis is that the granular neural network will be able to learn the Iris data set, but not as accurately as a standard neural network. Our network is a novel neuro-fuzzy systems architecture called the linguistic neural network. The defining characteristic of this network is that all connection weights are linguistic variables, whose values are updated by adding linguistic hedges. We define two new hedges, whose semantics require a generalization of the standard definition of linguistic variables. These generalized linguistic variables lead naturally to a linguistic arithmetic, which we prove forms a vector space. The node functions of the linguistic neural network are defined in terms of this linguistic arithmetic. The learning method used for the network is a modified Backpropagation algorithm, with the original arithmetic operations replaced by their linguistic equivalents. In a simulation experiment, this granulated version of the multilayer perceptron achieved 90% accuracy on the Iris data set, using a coarse granulation.

The following approach shows, that these limitations can be overcome by using an adaptive hierarchical vector quantizing algorithm. With this algorithm the calculation time of a classification can decrease down to O(log(n)), where n is the number of implemented prototypes.

First, theories tend to be weak or non-existent, which makes problem formulation open ended by forcing us to consider a large number of independent variables and thereby increasing the dimensionality of the search space. Second, the weak relationships among variables tend to be nonlinear, and may hold only in limited areas of the search space. Third, in financial practice, where analysts conduct extensive manual analysis of historically well performing indicators, a key is to find the hidden interactions among variables that perform well in combination. Unfortunately, these are exactly the patterns that the greedy search biases incorporated by many standard rule learning algorithms will miss. One of the basic choices faced by modelers is on the choice of search method to use. Some methods, notably, tree induction provide explicit models that are easy to understand. This is a big advantage of such methods over, say, neural nets or naïve Bayes. My experience in financial domains is that decision makers are more likely to invest capital using models that are easy to understand. More specifically, decision makers want to understand when to pay attention to specific market indicators, and in particular, in what ranges and under what conditions these indicators produce good risk- adjusted returns. Indeed, many professional traders have remarked that they are occasionally inclined to make predictions about market volatility and direction, but cannot specify these conditions precisely or with any degree of confidence. For this reason, rules generated by pattern discovery algorithms are particularly appealing in this respect because they can make explicit to the decision maker the particular interactions among the various market indicators that produce desirable results. They can offer the decision maker a “loose theory” about the problem that is easy to critique. In this talk, I describe and evaluate several variations of a new genetic learning algorithm (GLOWER) on a variety of data sets. The design of GLOWER has been motivated by financial prediction problems, but incorporates successful ideas from tree induction and rule learning. I examine the performance of several GLOWER variants on a standard financial prediction problem (S&P500 stock returns), using the results to identify one of the better variants for further comparisons. I introduce a new (to KDD) financial prediction problem (predicting positive and negative earnings surprises), and experiment with GLOWER, contrasting it with tree- and rule-induction approaches as well as other approaches such as neural nets and naïve Bayes. The results are encouraging, showing that GLOWER has the ability to uncover effective patterns for difficult problems that have weak structure and significant nonlinearities. Finally, I shall discuss open issues such as the difficulties of dealing with non stationarity in financial markets.",2002-04-23,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/3-540-45329-6_3,springer

This popularity is due to several factors: Remote sensing applications are data rich [they rely increasingly on high dimensional imagery]. Remote sensing data arise from complex physical and radiometric processes. There has been dissatisfaction with more conventional pattern recognition algorithms. There is a general desire to get maximum accuracy out of the data in remote sensing; high accuracy in some applications [e.g. agricultural subsidy fraud monitoring, mineral resource location] has high economic value.

We investigate the distribution of offspring fitnesses from the best individuals of each generation in a population-based genetic algorithm, and see no trends towards higher probabilities of producing higher fitness offspring, and no trends towards higher probabilities of not producing lower fitness offspring.

Pragmatically speaking, exploratory analysis may be paraphrased as natural language processing by means of analyzing large corpora of text. Concerning the analysis, appropriate means are statistics, on the one hand, and artificial neural networks, on the other hand. As a challenging application area for exploratory analysis of text corpora we may certainly identify text databases, be it information retrieval or information filtering systems. With this paper we present recent findings of exploratory analysis based on both statistical and neural models applied to legal text corpora. Concerning the artificial neural networks, we rely on a model adhering to the unsupervised learning paradigm. This choice appears naturally when taking into account the specific properties of large text corpora where one is faced with the fact that input-output-mappings as required by supervised learning models cannot be provided beforehand to a satisfying extent. This is due to the fact of the highly changing contents of text archives. In a nutshell, artificial neural networks count for their highly robust behavior regarding the parameters for model optimization. In particular, we found statistical classification techniques much more susceptible to minor parameter variations than unsupervised artificial neural networks. In this paper we describe two different lines of research in exploratory analysis. First, we use the classification methods for concept analysis. The general goal is to uncover different meanings of one and the same natural language concept. A task that, obviously, is of specific importance during the creation of thesauri. As a convenient environment to present the results we selected the legal term of “neutrality”, which is a perfect representative of a concept having a number of highly divergent meanings. Second, we describe the classification methods in the setting of document classification. The ultimate goal in such an application is to uncover semantic similarities of various text documents in order to increase the efficiency of an information retrieval system. In this sense, document classification has its fixed position in information retrieval research from the very beginning. Nowadays renewed massive interest in document classification may be witnessed due to the appearance of large-scale digital libraries.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1023/A:1008365524782,springer

In addition, we also strive to achieve good scale invariance and robustness against partial occlusion as in any practical 2D object recognition system. The proposed system uses multi-view model representations and objects are recognised by self-organised dynamic link matching. The merit of this approach is that it offers a compact framework for concurrent assessments of multiple match hypotheses by promoting competitions and/or co-operations among several local mappings of model and test image feature correspondences.

Here we introduce temporal neighborhoods as small groups of states that experience frequent intra-group transitions during on-line sampling. We then form basis functions along these temporal neighborhoods. Empirical evidence is provided which demonstrates the effectiveness of this scheme. We discuss a class of RL problems for which this method might be plausible.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BFb0098206,springer

A common method of doing this involves mapping the pixel values of the image onto the input nodes of a feed-forward net. This is problematic in that the topological properties of the original image space, such as the spatial relations between different pixels, are not immediately apparent to the net. We address this problem by using the real valued coordinates of selected features in the image for input to the net. This paper details a formative study of the Curvature Primal Sketch (CPS) as a preprocessing method to identify the interesting features of the curves that make up handwritten characters. Emphasis is placed upon integrating the CPS with a feedforward neural network classifier. To this end, we describe an algorithm for selecting which of the features produced by the CPS should be used as input to the neural network. We postulate that the order in which the features are used as inputs to the net is also important and introduce a solution to this problem. The nets obtained by this approach were small and performed recognition well. A net with dimensions 14–14–10 was trained with collection of 500 handwritten digits, collected from different people. On a similar test set of 100 digits, the net was found to achieve 92.8% accuracy in recognition.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-6384-9_9,springer

In this paper we describe a successful application of this Molecular Design methodology that has resulted in novel bactericidal peptides of real value. A key issue for commercial utilisation of such results is the ability to protect the intellectual property rights associated with the discovery of new molecules. Typically peptide patents use structural templates of amino acid hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity that define highly regular peptide patent spaces. In an extension of established patenting practice we describe a patent application that uses a Neural Net predictive model to define the regions of peptide space that we claim within the patent.

This theory considers the spatial optimality of the coordination: to minimize the end-effector position error of the eye-hand system as well as the differentiation of the joint angles with respect to the end-effector positions over all the bounded work space. By introducing variational methods with respect to the space, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) of the joint angles with respect to the work space. The equation includes a diffusion term. For the given boundary conditions and the initial conditions, it can be solved uniquely, and the solution is a well organized map. From the motor learning point of view, our approach contains both the aspects of supervised learning as well as self-organization. Firstly, we assume that the forward relation from the hand system's joint angles to its end-effector positions can be obtained using supervised learning, and at the boundary of the work space, the supervisor can provide correct joint information. Then, by evolving the diffusion equation, we organize the visuomotor coordination. We show the effectiveness of this approach using a 3-dof scale manipulator. The problems of how to realize the visuomotor map; how to utilize the resultant map in several motions; and what are the influences of the initial conditions on the map formation and the relation to the boundary conditions are also discussed using computer simulations. Our approach has three advantages: (1) it does not require too many trial motions for the eye-hand system; (2) during the map formation process, it requires only the local interactions between each node; and (3) it guarantees the final map's spatial optimality over all the bounded work space.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s004220050478,springer

Thus the signals in such networks are analog, and the action of a synapse on a signal passing through it takes place in the form of a scalar product in L ^2 between the functional weight and the signal. In this paper, four classes of FANNs are introduced. They result from the solution of a nonparametric optimization problem in a generalized Fock space (GFS) of abstract Volterra series under interpolating or smoothing input-output training data constraints. Two of these classes of FANNs correspond to the interpolating case and are represented by what we call the (two-layer) optimal interpolating (OI) FANN and the optimal multilayer neural interpolating (OMNI) FANN . The remaining two classes correspond to the smoothing case. We name their representations as the (two-layer) optimal smoothing (OS) FANN and the optimal smoothing multilayer artificial neural (OSMAN) FANN . In addition to providing the background and the derivation of these FANNs, this paper presents a novel approach to their implementation. This approach does away with the computationally cumbersome use of functional weights. Instead, the effect of these weights is provided by linear time-invariant differential equation models of which those weights are impulse responses. These are implemented by a linear filter bank. This approach thus leads to simple and meaningful causal realizations of FANNs which we call Dynamical FANNs or simply D-FANNs.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01202856,springer
Article,doi:10.1007/BF01202855,Are analog neural networks better than binary neural networks?,"Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing",10.1007/BF01202855,Springer,1998-03-01,,"In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing an objective function over the discrete set {−1, 1}^ n using a neural network. It is now known that a binary (two-state) Hopfield network can take, in the worst case, an exponential number of time steps to find even a local maximum of the objective function. In this paper, we carry this argument further by studying the radius of attraction of the global maxima of the objective function. If a binary neural network is used, in general there is no guarantee that a global maximum has a nonzero radius of attraction. In other words, even if the optimization process is started off with the neural network in an initial state that is adjacent to the global maximum, the resulting trajectory of the network may not converge to the nearby maximum, but may instead go off to another maximum. At the same time, another set of recent results shows that, if an analog neural network is used to optimize the same objective function, then every local maximum of the objective function has a nontrivial domain of attraction, and conversely, the only equilibria that are attractive are the local maxima of the objective function. This raises the question as to whether analog neural networks offer some advantages over binary neural networks for optimizing the same objective function. As a motivation for this line of inquiry, we study the problem of decoding an algebraic block code using a neural network. It is shown that the binary neural network implementation has the undesirable property that all the global maxima of the objective function have a zero radius of attraction. In contrast, if an analog neural network is used to maximize exactly the same objective function, the region of attraction of each maximum contains not only the associated “orthant” of the state space, but also some points not in this orthant. In other words, the analog implementation exhibits the desired tolerance to transmission errors, whereas the binary neural network does not have this property. With this motivation, two open questions are posed that provide a program of research for studying the possible superiority of analog neural networks over binary neural networks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01202855,springer

However, despite its various technical advantages, the distribution and expansion of the intelligent agent system approach has been limited because existing methodologies rely on specialized applications and therefore require intensive investment to develop new systems. In an attempt to conquer these difficulties, a standardized methodology to construct intelligent agent systems is proposed. This approach deviates from current agent system approaches of repeatedly constructing new and customized expert systems. Specifically, it provides an economical method for developing intelligent agent systems by investigating the possibility of standardizing message communication protocols in linguistics speech-act theory and by supplementing traditional algorithmic systems with intelligent segments using, among others, expert system tools. To verify effectiveness, the shop-floor scheduling system of a large-scale shipbuilding yard has been redesigned, developed, and tested using this approach. This shop-floor scheduling system requires the scheduling of when and where to process block construction under various constraints. It is a difficult four-dimensional time and space allocation problem involving traditional NP-complete search spaces.

The input image is initially processed using the TCS texture-highlighting technique and is then presented to the SOLNN network which segments it. The SOLNN is characterised by a variable sensitivity which enables it to be fine-tuned to detect different sub-textures within each texture to the desired degree of detail. The experimental results reported here illustrate the fact that the SOLNN indeed clusters accurately the textural information so that each cluster represents a single texture even for images which are objectively very difficult to segment. Thus, it is supported that the proposed approach leads to the design of an effective texture-based image-segmentation system .",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01414006,springer

Specifically, the focus is on the rate at which the lowest achievable error can be reduced as larger subsets of S are allowed when constructing an approximant. The new results extend those given for Hilbert spaces by Jones and Barron, including, in particular, a computationally attractive incremental approximation scheme. Bounds are derived for broad classes of Banach spaces; in particular, for L _p spaces with 1< p <∞, the O ( n ^−1/2) bounds of Barron and Jones are recovered when p =2. One motivation for the questions studied here arises from the area of “artificial neural networks,” where the problem can be stated in terms of the growth in the number of “neurons” (the elements of S ) needed in order to achieve a desired error rate. The focus on non-Hilbert spaces is due to the desire to understand approximation in the more “robust” (resistant to exemplar noise) L _p, 1 ≤ p <2, norms. The techniques used borrow from results regarding moduli of smoothness in functional analysis as well as from the theory of stochastic processes on function spaces.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF02678464,springer

They present a practical application of the theoretical resolution of Hilbert's 13^ th problem by Kolmogorov and Lorenz, and have been used with success in a variety of applications. However, as the training data grows in both dimension and size, larger network implementations are required. As a consequence, in most cases scaling problems arise; the existing training algorithms can not handle the vast search space, saturation occurs at the output of the hidden layer nodes and, in general, the network becomes inflexible, slow and inefficient. Considering all of the above, we are proposing a methodology for breaking down the traditionally single and rigid FFNN into an entity of simpler units, in line with the connectionist view of the distributive representation of knowledge and using Kolmogorov's paradigm of approximating functions of many variables by compositions of one-variable functions. Although the entities' concept is still developing, some preliminary results indicate superiority over the single FFNN model when applicable to problems involving high-dimensional data (e.g. financial/meteorological data analysis, etc.).",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BFb0032493,springer

We present here a new analytical method for deriving conditions for the emergence of structure in SOMs which is particularly suited for the as yet inaccessible high-dimensional SOM variant. Our approach is based on an evaluation of a map distortion function. It involves only an ansatz for the way stimuli are distributed among map neurons; the receptive fields of the map need not be known explicitly. Using this method we first calculate regions of stability for four possible states of SOMs projecting from a rectangular input space to a ring of neurons. We then analyze the transition from nonoriented to oriented receptive fields in a SOM-based model for the development of orientation maps.

The criteria for evaluating statistical dependence are those defined in Chapter 4: the cumulant expansion method and the minimization of the mutual information among output components. Atick and Redlich [6.1] and especially the two papers of Redlich [6.2]–[6.3] use similar information theoretic concepts and reversible cellular automata architectures in order to define how nonlinear decorrelation can be performed. Taylor and Coombes [6.4] presented an extension of Oja’s learning rule for polynomial, i.e. higher order neural networks .",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-4016-7_6,springer

Several estimators are considered. A k -NN technique has been developed to compare these using a learning set based artificially generated validation set. Experiments show that applying the developed estimators on a validation set gives the same results as applying the estimators on an independent test set.

One of the most prominent ways to represent text documents is by means of keywords extracted from the full-text of the documents and thus, document collections represent high dimensional input spaces by nature. We use a growing and splitting neural network as the underlying model for document classification. The apparent advantage of such a neural network is the adaptive network architecture that develops according to the specific requirements of the actual input space. As a consequence, the class structure of the input data becomes visible due to the separation of units into disconnected areas.

So in order to help the operator in the fulfilment of his job to achieve rapid, reliable and repeatable non destructive evaluation, we have caried out for the last four years a project named SEQUOIA, in which Artificial Intelligence has been integrated.

This classification technique is used to correlate temporal thermal signatures with sound and defected regions of an inspected part. As thermal modelling is now well developed and comprehensive, the investigative study relies on the training of the neural network on theoretical thermograms so that we can produce as many examples as one can think of.

But such a requirement generally involves NP-completeness. In a way, CN2 provides a greedy approach to the problem. In this paper, we propose to search the solution space more extensively, using a stochastic procedure, an association of simulated annealing (SA) and simple tabu search (TS) in two distinct phases.

We interpret the gauge theory actions from the Atiyah-Jeffrey point of view and relate them to supersymmetric quantum mechanics on spaces of connections.

One of the advantages of ANNs is that the processing is distributed among many nodes, this provides a good degree of fault tolerance even if some of its nodes or interconnections fails to function properly. But this features needs to be emphasized, improved, and maximized through different techniques. In this work we are presenting a method for training ANNs to improve its fault tolerance capabilities using genetic algorithms. Our measure for fault tolerance is the deviation of the network’s output, when the interconnection weights are perturbed, from that output without perturbation. In our method we try to maintain that deviation as minimum as possible, i.e. the network should produce correct results even with the existence of error in the network structure. In this work we show that, depending on how neural networks is trained, the sensitivity of its output to perturbation in interconnection weights can vary dramatically. The perturbation in interconnection weights (network parameters) can reflect the errors that arise when such network implemented in hardware. The fault tolerance of ANNs has been formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem with multivariants and nonlinear constraints, then solved by genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithm has been proven a successful method for training, and optimizing the structure of neural networks. Genetic algorithms are a robust method based on biological principles. A population of strings representing possible problem solution is maintained. Search proceeds by recombining strings in the population. The theoretical foundations of genetic algorithms are based on the notion that selective reproduction and recombination of binary strings change the sampling rate of hyperplanes in the search space so as to reflect the average fitness of strings that reside in any particular hyperplane. In this work we have used genetic algorithms to train feed forward neural networks subject to maximize its fault tolerance capabilities and this has been presented, explained by examples, and supported by computer simulation results.",2012-04-10,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-1-4471-2063-6_154,springer

GPP is a task within the IL exploration discovery system. We developed GPP for use in the discovery of mathematical operators with a wider class of representations than was possible with the previous methods by Lenat and by Shen. GPP utilizes the purpose for which an operator is created to prune the possible definitions. The relevant search spaces are immense and there exists insufficient information for a complete evaluation of the purpose constraint, so it is necessary to perform a partial evaluation of the purpose (i.e., pruning) constraint. The constraint is first transformed so that it is operational with respect to the partial information, and then it is applied to examples in order to test the generated candidates for an operator's definition. In the GPP process, once a candidate definition survives this empirical prune, it is passed on to a theorem prover for formal verification. In this paper, we describe the application of this methodology to the (re)discovery of the definition of multiplication for Conway numbers, a discovery which is difficult for human mathematicians. We successfully model this discovery process utilizing information which was reasonably available at the time of Conway's original discovery.

The structure of the sinks constructed by Newhouse is limited. “Simple” Newhouse parameter values are values at which there are infinitely many sinks having some special well defined property concerning the structure. A result due to Tedeschini-Lalli and Yorke [TY] says that the Lebesgue measure of the set of simple Newhouse parameter values is zero when the tangencies are due to the standard “affine” horseshoe map. It is argued in [TY] and [PR] that a more general derivation of this measure zero result would be desirable.

We also observe that if the bulk is in the phase to which the symmetry is engendered by a subgroup Z(p) , such that p<q , the surface of the system is in the same phase or in a less symmetrical phase to which the symmetry is engendered by a subgroup Z(m) of Z(p) such that p=αm (m≦p) with α an integer number satisfying 1≦α≦ p . The case α= p corresponds to the least symmetrical phase. Since the infinite Z(q) models exhibit a rich variety of phase transitions and multicritical points, the semi-infinite models present new ordinary, extraordinary, surface and special phase transitions which do not occur in the semi-infinite Ising-like systems.

The behaviour of this transformation is studied. It has two hyperbolic fixed points for which the existence of a global critical line is proven. The asymptotic behaviour of the transformation is used to prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit in a certain domain in parameter space. Also the existence of a continuum limit for these theories is investigated using informatioin about the asymptotic renomralization behaviour. It turns out that the “trivial” fixed point gives rise to a twoparameter family of continuum limits corresponding to that part of parameter space where the renormalization trajectories originate at this fixed point. Although the model is not very realistic it serves as a simple example of the application of the renormalization group to proving the existence of the thermodynamic limit and the continuum limit of lattice models. Moreover, it illustrates possible complications that can arise in global renormalization group behaviour, and that might also be present in other models where no global analysis of the renormalization transformation has yet been achieved.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF02096796,springer

This is particularly common in systems with garbage collection, since the garbage collector must be able to distinguish pointers from non-pointers, and to learn the length of records pointed to. The use of tag bits leads to inefficiency. In addition to the obvious space overhead (tag bits and record descriptors occupy memory space), there is a time overhead: tag bits must be stripped off of data before arithmetic operations are performed, and re-attached to the data when it is stored into memory. This takes either extra instructions at runtime, or special tag-handling hardware, or both. This paper shows how the use of tag bits, record descriptor words, explicit type parameters, and the like can be avoided in languages (like ML) with static polymorphic typechecking. Though a form of tag will still be required for user-defined variant records, all other type information can be encoded once—in the program—rather than replicated many times in the data.

Several of the systems are in routine use by operations staff and solve problems which formerly required highly trained human experts. The power of AI techniques results from several factors including sophisticated development tools, powerful ways to represent and reason with knowledge, and an expressive user interface. Although this paper has used the HST as a case study, most features of HST operations are common to other observatories, both space- and ground-based. NASA's great observatories such as the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), the Space Station, and ground-based telescopes such as the European Very Large Telescope and Texas-Penn State Spectrocopic Survey Telescope can benefit from applications of AI technology.

Beautiful work of Donaldson [18, 19], Hitchin [24, 25] and Taubes [37, 39, 40] shows that gauge equivalence classes of monopoles correspond to based rational self-maps of the Riemann sphere. Similarly, the non-linear σ models we consider here are based harmonic maps from the Riemann sphere to complex projective m space. In seminal work, Segal [35] studied ℛ( m )_ k , the space of based rational maps from the Riemann sphere to complex projective m space of a fixed degree k . Any element of ℛ( m )_ k is clearly an element of Ω _ k ^2 CP ( m ), the space of all based continuous maps from the Riemann sphere to complex projective m space of a fixed degree k , and this assignment gives rise to the natural inclusion of ℛ( m )_ k in Ω _ k ^2 CP ( m ). Segal showed that these natural inclusions are homotopy equivalences through dimension k (2 m − 1). As the topology of the two-fold loop space Ω^2 CP ( m ) is well understood, Segal's result gives a very efficient way to explicitly determine the low dimensional topology of ℛ( m )_ k .

The statistical dynamics is further reduced to a one dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in a parameter range corresponding to that where most experiments have been performed.

In this paper, the second and the third problems are treated at computational, representational and hardware levels of Marr. We first study the problems at the computational level, and then propose an iterative learning scheme as a possible algorithm. This is a trial and error type learning such as repetitive training of golf swing. The amount of motor command needed to coordinate activities of many muscles is not determined at once, but in a step-wise, trial and error fashion in the course of a set of repetitions. Actually, the motor command in the ( n +1)-th iteration is a sum of the motor command in the n -th iteration plus two modification terms which are, respectively, proportional to acceleration and speed errors between the desired trajectory and the realized trajectory in the n -th iteration. We mathematically formulate this iterative learning control as a Newton-like method in functional spaces and prove its convergence under appropriate mathematical conditions with use of dynamical system theory and functional analysis. Computer simulations of this iterative learning control of a robotic manipulator in the body or visual coordinates are shown. Finally, we propose that areas 2, 5, and 7 of the sensory association cortex are possible sites of this learning control.

If the ghost number is negative there is only the trivial class whose elements are equivalent to zero. If the ghost number is positive or zero there is a bijective correspondence between the BRST classes and those of the exterior derivative along the gauge orbits. These gauge orbits lie in the phase space surface on which the gauge generators are constrained to vanish. The BRST invariant functions of ghost number p are then related to closed p -forms along the orbits. The addition of a BRST variation corresponds to the addition of an exact form.

There is no automorphism of the conformal superalgebra which induces T or PT on space time. Automorphisms of su(2, 2) which belong to these last two components induce transformations on the conformal superalgebra which reverse the sign of the odd brackets. In this sense conformal supersymmetry prefers CP to CPT. The operator of charge conjugation acting on spinors, as is found in the standard texts, induces conformal inversion and hence a parity transformation on space time, when considered as acting on the odd generators of the conformal superalgebra. Although it commutes with Lorentz transformations, it does not commute with all of su(2, 2). We propose a different operator for charge conjugation. Geometrically it is induced by the Hodge star operator acting on twistor space. Under the known realization of conformal states from the inclusion SU(2, 2) →Sp(8) and the metaplectic representations, its action on states is induced by the unique (up to phase) antilinear intertwining operator between the two metaplectic representations.

This is followed by an asymptotic regime with one or several attractors into which trajectories inject after long times. There is however, no sharp crossover between these two regimes and the identification of either one depends on the precision of measurement. In order to investigate these issues, we studied the dynamics of contracting integer maps. We found out that for the cases which in the continuum limit correspond to bifurcations, transients consists of two regimes sharply separated by a crossover point which displays universal scaling with the size of the set. Moreover, their average lengths display power law dependence on the accuracy of their measurement. This behavior persists away from bifurcation but with a different scaling law.

Corresponding to the vector space fibers of the DeWitt supermanifold, a Rogers supermanifold has a foliation by submanifolds, or leaves, parametrized by soul coordinates only. We show that the universal covering space of any leaf always admits a flat metric. If the covering space is complete in this metric, it must in fact be a vector space. We combine this result with known theorems about foliations to give conditions under which a compact Rogers supermanifold with a single even dimension is necessarily a quotient space of flat superspace. We also show that a supermanifold defined by a polynomial equation in flat superspace is always of the DeWitt type. Finally, we exhibit new supermanifold structures for R ^2 and the 2-torus which show that the foliation of a Rogers supermanifold can be quite exotic.",,http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/BF01208823,springer

In regular regions of phase space the time evolution of the probability distribution shows an algebraic decay of correlations as in quantum mechanics.

This linear model is exactly soluble. We find that different treatments of the supplementary (i.e. Lorentz) condition lead to boson models with rather different properties. We choose one model and construct, from the gauge invariant subalgebra, a class of inequivalent charge sectors.

This leaves open the question of whether any wider continuity properties follow and what form they would take. We show that much richer continuity properties do follow in a natural fashion for every cyclic representation of the canonical commutation relations. In particular, we show that the test function space may be taken as a metric space, that the space may be uniquely completed in this topology, and that the map into the unitary Weyl operators is strongly continuous in this topology. The topology induced by this metric is minimal in the sense that it is the weakest vector topology for which the maps f → U ( f ), g → V ( g ) are strongly continuous.

A stochastic variant of the Arrow-Hurwitz method was proposed in [7] for the solution of such problems. It is of particular importance to find new means, different from (13)–(14), of controlling the step length ϱ s. Apart from the fact that the control (13)–(14) has a rigid, programmed nature, it is determinate, i.e., it does not depend on the actual trajectory of the “descent.” The process (9)–(10) is random and defines a whole family of trajectories from the initial point to the minimum point. The control (13)–(14) is calculated once for the whole family, so sufficiently rapid convergence cannot be expected from it.

Propositions of quantum logic are interpreted as corresponding to certain macroscopic objects called filters; these objects are used to select beams of particles. The problem of representing the propositions as projectors in a Hilbert space is considered and the classical approach to this question due to Birkhoff and von Neumann is criticized as neglecting certain physically important properties of filters. A new approach to this problem is proposed. The second part of the paper contains a revision of the concept of a state in quantum mechanics. The set of all states of a physical system is considered as an abstract space with a geometry determined by the transition probabilities. The existence of a representation of states by vectors in a Hilbert space is shown to impose strong limitations on the geometric structure of the space of states. Spaces for which this representation does not exist are called non-Hilbertian. Simple examples of non-Hilbertian spaces are given and their possible physical meaning is discussed.
