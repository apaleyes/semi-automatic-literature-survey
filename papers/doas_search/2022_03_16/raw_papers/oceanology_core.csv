224823876,2019,"In the original article, there was an error. The name of the transgenic line used was incorrect. The correct name of the line is ""mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114"" Corrections have been made to the Materials and Methods subsection Animals: ""Adult Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114) (Renshaw et al., 2006; Bernut et al., 2014) zebrafish (kindly provided by Prof. Meijer, Leiden University), expressing mCherry under the macrophage-specific mpeg1 promotor and GFP under the neutrophil-specific mpx promotor were housed in Zebtec family tanks (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) under continuous flow-through at 28°C (14/10-hour light/dark cycle) at Carus facilities (WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands). Zebrafish were fed with a mixture of Artemia 230.000 npg (Ocean Nutrition Europe, Essen, Belgium) and Tetramin Flakes (Tetra, Melle, Germany) twice per day. Embryos were obtained by natural spawning and raised with E3 water (0.10 mM NaCl in demineralized water, pH 7.6) in petri dishes at 28°C (12/12-hour light/dark cycle) (Westerfield, 2007). Dead or fungus-infected embryos were identified by microscopy and discarded in tricaine/E3 solution [8.4% (v/v) 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) stock solution in E3]. Larval ages are expressed in days post-fertilization (dpf). From 5 dpf onward larvae were fed with live daily cultured Tetrahymena pyriformis."" Materials and Methods, subsection Dose-Response Experiment Saponin Exposure: ""Double Tg(mpeg1:mCherry /mpx:eGFPi114) zebrafish larvae were randomly distributed in 6 well plates (n = 20 fish/well) and exposed to different concentrations [0, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mg/ml] of saponin [ultrapure Soy Saponin 95%, kindly provided by Trond Kortner NMBU Oslo Norway, origin: Organic Technologies, Coshocton, OH (Krogdahl et al., 2015)] dissolved in the E3 (10 ml solution/well) from 6-9 dpf. Mortality was registered and all media were refreshed daily. At 24 h (7 dpf) and 72 h (9 dpf) after the start of the immersion, zebrafish (n = 6-11/group) were anaesthetized embedded and imaged using fluorescent microscopy (as described below). Per time point several larvae were euthanized for further analysis with an overdose MS-222 (8.4 ml of 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) in 100 ml E3). Pools of 5 larvae were used for RNA extraction (3 pools per group at 24 h, 7-9 pools per group at 72 h) and gene expression was measured on cDNA by Real Time PCR (as described below). Two independent experiments were performed and data were combined."" Materials and Methods, subsection Fluorescent in vivo imaging: ""Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114) zebrafish larvae were anaesthetized with tricaine/E3 solution (4.2 ml of 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) in 100 ml E3) and embedded in 1% low melting point agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, United States). Larvae were imaged as whole mounts with a Leica M205 FA Fluorescence Stereo Microscope. After image acquisition, pictures were analyzed with ImageJ® software (United States National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States). The intestinal regions were manually selected per fish on the basis of the bright light picture and subsequently copied to the green and red channel pictures (Supplementary Figure S1). Within this intestinal region individual cells were counted for each fish. Furthermore, corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) was measured in ImageJ® on total fish larvae by using the following formula: Integrated density-(area of total fish x mean fluorescence of the background reading)."" Material and Methods, subsection Experimental Design and Sampling Strategy Antibiotics and Saponin Exposure: A graphical representation of the experimental design and analysis performed per time-point is displayed in Figure 1. To assess the effect of antibiotics, 4 dpf Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114) fish were randomly distributed in five 6 well-plates (n = 20 fish/well) and 3 treatment conditions were established: (1) control (E3), (2) ciprofloxacin 5 μg/L (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) or (3) oxytetracycline hydrochloride 5 μg/L (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) (10 ml solution/well). The dose of antibiotics was based on several reviews and experimental papers summarizing environmental concentrations of antibiotics in water environments (Ding and He, 2010; Carvalho and Santos, 2016; Watts et al., 2017; Patrolecco et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018b) to be at a low dose (ng-μg/L range) and not acute dose (mg/L range). At 6 dpf, 4 pools of 5 larvae were sampled to assess changes in gene expression at baseline. Moreover, at 6 dpf DNA was isolated from 3 pools of 5 larvae to investigate microbiome composition at baseline. In vivo imaging was performed on n = 10 larvae/group to visualize innate immune cells. Subsequently, after sampling, at 6 dpf ultrapure soy saponin was applied to half of the remaining larvae at a concentration 0.5 mg/ml (to induce mild immune stimulation) so each treatment group was split into two, resulting in 6 treatment groups: (1) control, (2) ciprofloxacin (5 μg/L), (3) oxytetracycline hydrochloride (5 μg/L), (4) saponin (0.5 mg/ml), (5) ciprofloxacin + saponin (5 μg/L + 0.5 mg/ml), and (6) oxytetracycline hydrochloride + saponin (5 μg/L + 0.5 mg/ml). All treatment media were refreshed daily. At 9 dpf in vivo imaging was performed on n = 10 larvae/group to visualize innate immune cells. Gene expression was performed on 4 pools of 5 larvae to investigate immune gene expression and from 3 pools of 5 larvae DNA was isolated for microbiological analysis. Because of the error reported above, corrections have also been made to the Figure legends of Figure 2 and Figure 4. The correct legends appear below.

(A) Percent survival of zebrafish exposed to control (E3), 0.5 mg/ml saponin, 0.7 mg/ml saponin and 1 mg/ml saponin from 6-9 dpf (n = 40 fish/treatment) (Log-rank Mantel-Cox Test for Chi-square, ∗∗∗p < 0.0005).

483655291,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, we present initial results from our distributed edge systems research in the domain of sustainable harvesting of common good resources in the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, we are developing a digital platform for real-time privacy-preserving sustainability management in the domain of commercial fishery surveillance operations. This is in response to potentially privacy-infringing mandates from some governments to combat overfishing and other sustainability challenges. Our approach is to deploy sensory devices and distributed artificial intelligence algorithms on mobile, offshore fishing vessels and at mainland central control centers. To facilitate this, we need a novel data plane supporting efficient, available, secure, tamper-proof, and compliant data management in this weakly connected offshore environment. We have built our first prototype of Dorvu, a novel distributed file system in this context. Our devised architecture, the design trade-offs among conflicting properties, and our initial experiences are further detailed in this paper",File System Support for Privacy-Preserving Analysis and Forensics in Low-Bandwidth Edge Environments,10.3390/info12100430,,"[{'title': 'Information', 'identifiers': ['issn:2078-2489', '2078-2489']}]",'MDPI AG',core
482104201,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Short-term hourly reliable prediction of significant wave height is an important research topic in coastal engineering. Many researchers have carried out in-depth studies in many ocean regions. Generally, most of this work is implemented through numerical models. However, as for numerical models, with the increase of hourly prediction duration, the accumulation of wave randomness leads to the poor prediction effect. In this paper, four buoy stations in the Taiwan Strait are taken as the research objects. We propose a significant wave height prediction algorithm, which combines numerical weather prediction model WRF and deep-learning model, called WRF-CLSF(Convolution-LSTM-FC). WRF can forecast 24-h wind speed in real-time, based on a variety of interpretable physical mechanisms. CLSF aims to extract the information of historical wind-wave interaction scale and the trend of wind-wave coherence, with the help of convolution operation and the time series model(LSTM), respectively. In the experiment, the proposed model was compared with the state-of-the-art prediction model. The results show that WRF-CLSF has an outstanding prediction effect at four buoy observation stations along with the Taiwan Strait",Significant wave height forecasting using WRF-CLSF model in Taiwan strait,10.1080/19942060.2021.1974947,,"[{'title': 'Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics', 'identifiers': ['issn:1997-003X', '1997-003x', 'issn:1994-2060', '1994-2060']}]",'Informa UK Limited',core

The regular meeting of the Village of Milo was held on Monday, February 17, 2003 at 7:00 p.m. at the Village Office.
Present were Mayor Vooys, Councillor Whaley, Councillor Phillips, Municipal Administrator Dorothy Way, John and Bea Kuzma, and Bob Phair.
The minutes of the meeting held on January 20, 2003 were read. Councillor Phillips moved the adoption of the minutes. Councillor Whaley seconded. CARRIED.
Mayor Vooys attended a FCSS meeting. The FCSS will be running a courtesy vehicle in this area. Councillor Whaley attended a VBDC meeting and they will be hosting an economic development training course. The VBDC will be joining up with Tourism. Mayor Vooys thanked the Council for the flowers.
Town man Victor Crowe reported that the tractor is leaking power steering fluid. The tractor is to be repaired before we start cutting the grass in the spring. It was suggested that a barrel be put up at the water treatment plant for the water to drain into after the trucks fill up. The water could also be drained into the sewer pipe on the south side of the water treatment plant. The culvert at the end of Center Street needs to be flushed out. Mayor Vooys will talk to Doug Marks and see if we can have an oilfield hydro truck flush out this culvert. The other end of this culvert will have to be cleaned out before this can be done.
Mr. Bob Phair attended the meeting to gather information on the water reservoirs so the company he works for KENECO can put together a proposal for this project. Mr. Bob Phair and a construction personnel will take a look at the reservoirs. The Municipal Administrator to look into funding from Alta. Transportation & Utilities as well as Infrastructure funding. A letter to be sent to Alpine Engineering Ltd. stating that we will not require his services.
A letter has been sent to JRD Contracting confirming that he has the contract for doing the sidewalk repairs. The Village has received the funding for this project.
Mr. & Mrs. John Kuzma attended the meeting in regards to the sale of the lots in BLOCK C PLAN 1403JK. The 2 trailers that are on this lot will be moved. There is no gas line on the property. The trailers that were there previously used propane.
MOVED by Councillor Phillips that the Village apply for the STEP grant this year. CARRIED.
We received 2 quotes one from Trinus Technologies Inc. and one from the Management Information Group on Municipal software. The Municipal Administrator to talk to Delanoy and Ziel and see if they have any information on what programs we should be using.
AXIA was here to take measurements of where the wire and the box will be installed for the Supemet. Mayor Vooys and Councillor Phillips want to be contacted when they return.
Letters were received from the Oldman River Intermunicipal Service Agency and the Vulcan County on the proposed subdivision for a petroleum card lock facility. Letter to be sent to the Vulcan County and the Oldman River Intermunicipal Service Agency stating that the Village of Milo has no objection to this proposed subdivision and petroleum card lock facility. MOVED by Councillor Phillips that the Village of Milo approve the petroleum card lock facility. Mayor Vooys seconded. CARRIED. Councillor Whaley is opposed to this proposal. Councillor Phillips to contact the Arrowwood Co-op and get a copy of the letter from Alta. Transportation and Utilities for Councillor Whaley.
MOVED by Councillor Whaley that the Village of Milo approve the proposed resolution for membership in the Oldman River Regional Services Commission. The proposed resolution is as follows: THAT the Village of Milo join the Oldman River Regional services Commission. CARRIED.
No one has come forward to organize the Communities in Bloom for the Village.
The next Council meeting of the Village of Milo was set for Monday, March 17, 2003 at 7:00p.m. at the Village Office.
The meeting adjourned at 8:55 p.m.DUSTING
M A house becomes a home when you can write “I love you” on the furniture!”
I can’t tell you how many countless hours that I have spent CLEANING! I used to spend at least 8 hours every weekend making sure things were just perfect—“in case someone came over.” Then I realized one day that no one came over; they were all out living life
and having fun!
Now when people visit, I find no need to explain the ‘condition’ of my home. They are more interested in hearing about the things I’ve been doing while I was away living life and having fun! If you haven’t figured this out yet, Please heed this advice!!!
LIFE IS SHORT! ENJOY IT! Dust if you must, but wouldn’t it be better to paint a picture or write a letter, bake a cake or plant a seed,—ponder the difference between
want and need?
Dust if you must, but there’s not much time, with rivers to swim and mountains to climb, music to hear and books to read, —friends to cherish and life to lead.
Dust if you must, but the world’s out there, with the sun in your eyes, the wind in your hair, the flutter of snow, a shower of rain,—this day will not come around again!
Dust if you must, but bear in mind, old age will come, and it’s not kind.
And when you go—and go you must—you, yourself, will make more dust!

It is hard to remain in the world and not feel a part of it. To watch others rush about like nothing has changed \$hen everything has.
Grief makes you feel alone.
Yet you do have a place in the world And others who care for you.
There is still beauty and meaning in life And you will find it again,
For now, it is enough to rest, to mourn,
And wrap yourself in your memories.
The world can wait.
A MOTHER’S WISH,
Oh, give me patience when the little hands Tug at me with their ceaseless demands.
Oh, give me gentle lips and smiling eyes And keep my mouth from hasty, sharp replies. Oh, let me not in weariness, confusion or noise Obscure life’s vision from its fleeting joys.
And when in years to come my house is still No bitter memories its rooms may fill.

224809796,2019-01-01T00:00:00,"<p>In the original article, there was an error. The name of the transgenic line used was incorrect. The correct name of the line is ""mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114"" Corrections have been made to the Materials and Methods subsection Animals: ""Adult Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114) (Renshaw et al., 2006; Bernut et al., 2014) zebrafish (kindly provided by Prof. Meijer, Leiden University), expressing mCherry under the macrophage-specific mpeg1 promotor and GFP under the neutrophil-specific mpx promotor were housed in Zebtec family tanks (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) under continuous flow-through at 28°C (14/10-hour light/dark cycle) at Carus facilities (WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands). Zebrafish were fed with a mixture of Artemia 230.000 npg (Ocean Nutrition Europe, Essen, Belgium) and Tetramin Flakes (Tetra, Melle, Germany) twice per day. Embryos were obtained by natural spawning and raised with E3 water (0.10 mM NaCl in demineralized water, pH 7.6) in petri dishes at 28°C (12/12-hour light/dark cycle) (Westerfield, 2007). Dead or fungus-infected embryos were identified by microscopy and discarded in tricaine/E3 solution [8.4% (v/v) 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) stock solution in E3]. Larval ages are expressed in days post-fertilization (dpf). From 5 dpf onward larvae were fed with live daily cultured Tetrahymena pyriformis."" Materials and Methods, subsection Dose-Response Experiment Saponin Exposure: ""Double Tg(mpeg1:mCherry /mpx:eGFPi114) zebrafish larvae were randomly distributed in 6 well plates (n = 20 fish/well) and exposed to different concentrations [0, 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 mg/ml] of saponin [ultrapure Soy Saponin 95%, kindly provided by Trond Kortner NMBU Oslo Norway, origin: Organic Technologies, Coshocton, OH (Krogdahl et al., 2015)] dissolved in the E3 (10 ml solution/well) from 6-9 dpf. Mortality was registered and all media were refreshed daily. At 24 h (7 dpf) and 72 h (9 dpf) after the start of the immersion, zebrafish (n = 6-11/group) were anaesthetized embedded and imaged using fluorescent microscopy (as described below). Per time point several larvae were euthanized for further analysis with an overdose MS-222 (8.4 ml of 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) in 100 ml E3). Pools of 5 larvae were used for RNA extraction (3 pools per group at 24 h, 7-9 pools per group at 72 h) and gene expression was measured on cDNA by Real Time PCR (as described below). Two independent experiments were performed and data were combined."" Materials and Methods, subsection Fluorescent in vivo imaging: ""Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi<sub>114</sub>) zebrafish larvae were anaesthetized with tricaine/E3 solution (4.2 ml of 24 mM Tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) in 100 ml E3) and embedded in 1% low melting point agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, United States). Larvae were imaged as whole mounts with a Leica M205 FA Fluorescence Stereo Microscope. After image acquisition, pictures were analyzed with ImageJ® software (United States National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States). The intestinal regions were manually selected per fish on the basis of the bright light picture and subsequently copied to the green and red channel pictures (Supplementary Figure S1). Within this intestinal region individual cells were counted for each fish. Furthermore, corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) was measured in ImageJ® on total fish larvae by using the following formula: Integrated density-(area of total fish x mean fluorescence of the background reading)."" Material and Methods, subsection Experimental Design and Sampling Strategy Antibiotics and Saponin Exposure: A graphical representation of the experimental design and analysis performed per time-point is displayed in Figure 1. To assess the effect of antibiotics, 4 dpf Tg(mpeg1:mCherry/mpx:eGFPi114) fish were randomly distributed in five 6 well-plates (n = 20 fish/well) and 3 treatment conditions were established: (1) control (E3), (2) ciprofloxacin 5 μg/L (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) or (3) oxytetracycline hydrochloride 5 μg/L (Sigma-Aldrich, DL, United States) (10 ml solution/well). The dose of antibiotics was based on several reviews and experimental papers summarizing environmental concentrations of antibiotics in water environments (Ding and He, 2010; Carvalho and Santos, 2016; Watts et al., 2017; Patrolecco et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018b) to be at a low dose (ng-μg/L range) and not acute dose (mg/L range). At 6 dpf, 4 pools of 5 larvae were sampled to assess changes in gene expression at baseline. Moreover, at 6 dpf DNA was isolated from 3 pools of 5 larvae to investigate microbiome composition at baseline. In vivo imaging was performed on n = 10 larvae/group to visualize innate immune cells. Subsequently, after sampling, at 6 dpf ultrapure soy saponin was applied to half of the remaining larvae at a concentration 0.5 mg/ml (to induce mild immune stimulation) so each treatment group was split into two, resulting in 6 treatment groups: (1) control, (2) ciprofloxacin (5 μg/L), (3) oxytetracycline hydrochloride (5 μg/L), (4) saponin (0.5 mg/ml), (5) ciprofloxacin + saponin (5 μg/L + 0.5 mg/ml), and (6) oxytetracycline hydrochloride + saponin (5 μg/L + 0.5 mg/ml). All treatment media were refreshed daily. At 9 dpf in vivo imaging was performed on n = 10 larvae/group to visualize innate immune cells. Gene expression was performed on 4 pools of 5 larvae to investigate immune gene expression and from 3 pools of 5 larvae DNA was isolated for microbiological analysis. Because of the error reported above, corrections have also been made to the Figure legends of Figure 2 and Figure 4. The correct legends appear below.

(A) Percent survival of zebrafish exposed to control (E3), 0.5 mg/ml saponin, 0.7 mg/ml saponin and 1 mg/ml saponin from 6-9 dpf (n = 40 fish/treatment) (Log-rank Mantel-Cox Test for Chi-square, ∗∗∗p &lt; 0.0005).

82342801,2014-12-31,"AbstractIn this paper, an implementation study was undertaken to employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in third-generation ocean wave models for direct mapping of wind-wave spectra into exact nonlinear interactions. While the investigation expands on previously reported feasibility studies of Neural Network Interaction Approximations (NNIA), it focuses on a new robust neural network that is implemented in Wavewatch III (WW3) model. Several idealistic and real test scenarios were carried out. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of NNIA in terms of speeding-up model calculations and is fully capable of providing operationally acceptable model integrations. The ANN is able to emulate the exact nonlinear interaction for single-and multi-modal wave spectra with a much higher accuracy then Discrete Interaction Approximation (DIA). NNIA performs at least twice as fast as DIA and at least two hundred times faster than exact method (Web-Resio-Tracy, WRT) for a well trained dataset. The accuracy of NNIA is network configuration dependent. For most optimal network configurations, the NNIA results and scatter statistics show good agreement with exact results by means of growth curves and integral parameters. Practical possibilities for further improvements in achieving fast and highly accurate emulations using ANN for emulating time consuming exact nonlinear interactions are also suggested and discussed",Integration of Artificial Neural Networks into Operational Ocean Wave Prediction Models for Fast and Accurate Emulation of Exact Nonlinear Interactions ,10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.104,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82342801.pdf,,The Authors.

328785221,,"IoT, also known as Internet of Things, is a popular topic nowadays. Devices of various scales,
complexities, and functionalities are deployed for different tasks. However, there exist technical
difficulties in many circumstances where physical deployments are challenging or require
verifications beforehand. For example, it would be hard for a group of high school students, who
have no prior knowledge of circuits, to physically implement even the simplest circuit design.
Devices that would be massively deployed without human supervision, such as ocean quality
sensors, will also require verification in a simulation. Professor Matthew has been conducting
research on virtualizing IoT devices, where he aimed to provide a platform to construct virtual
circuits and deploy them in the virtual world. This platform allows users to monitor simulated inputs
and outputs through virtual consoles and change parameters and components of the circuits in a
virtual setup. To drive the virtual world, there should be an engine that simulates different aspects
of the real world, such as movement, weather, etc. Taking the example of monitoring animals,
there should be simulators that generate both the animals and environment. To simulate animals,
several attempts were made to accurately model different animals like zebra and lions. We initially used
an FSM-like model with fixed states to describe different actions and conditions of an animal,
then moved forward to a learning-based model using different machine learning techniques, like linear regressions and neural networks. With a learning-based, or black-box model, animals act
with more flexibility, instead of only allowing to be in the several fixed states. Circuit emulation is
also an important feature in the overall virtualization process. There were two steps to create a
virtual device. The first step involved physical testing and modeling of the devices, and the second
step involved mapping them into scripts that describe their behaviors. These two components are
essential parts for the entire IoT virtualization project since they generate all the simulations in the
virtual world, and they will be actively updated as we introduce more features to the project.U of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces",IoT virtualization for animal simulations,,,,,core
13906238,2003-06-01T00:00:00,"The project was aimed at exploring the possibilities of a new paradigm in modelling - data-driven modelling, often referred as ""data mining"". Several application areas were considered: sedimentation problems in the Port of Rotterdam, automatic soil classification on the basis of cone penetration tests, prediction of water levels in the ocean, and others. The methods applied included: artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, M5 model trees, chaos theory. The knowledge was disseminated using the following means: several publications at the conferences and peer-reviewed journals, Symposium for 80 Dutch participants from various civil engineering organisations (April 2002), Web-based platform with the main project results, software and knowledge base of best practices and publications. The developed research methodologies were practically used in the Delft Cluster research Themes and by external partners. Two PhD researches are underway and 4 MSc projects were successfully completed. A comprehensive Knowledge Platform ( http://datamining.ihe.nl) was built; it includes the educational components, links to the news and events in the area of data-driven modelling, knowledge base with the publications, software and best practices, and software with the examples of real case studies. The achieved results make possible to conclude that the data-driven methods can be effectively used in a wide range of civil engineering problems, complementing and sometimes replacing more traditional simulation models","Data mining, knowledge discovery and data-driven modelling",,,,Delft Cluster,core

Zeniths win Luther Tournament
The Zeniths traveled to Regina over the weekend and won the
prestigious *49 annual Luther Invitational Basketball Tournament,
beating Regina Winston Knoll Wolverines 87-84 in the championship
game. Jimmy Balderson led the points for the Zeniths in the final game
with 34 points and Allen Tollestrup added 21.
Magrath has only won the Luther Tournament twice in its
history. The other was in 1963.
Jimmy was named tournament most valuable player with a total
of 107 points in three games. This is the second highest point total ever
recorded over three games with the highest being 112 made by
Raymonds, Richard Bohne in 1989.
Magrath advanced to the final by opening with a 78-60 win over
the host Luther Lions. The dub then posted a 72-61 triumph over
Shddon-Williams Spartans of Regina in the semifinal game.
The Zeniths have had a great season this year with a lot of
exciting games. There is another exciting game coming up this Friday,
March 23 in Cardston. Also, you wont want to miss the playoffs to be
held at the Enmax Centre in Lethbridge on March 7-10. Come out and
support the Zeniths.

The parents of Chynna Johnston wish to say
how proud they are of her being named
Student of the Month for January at Robert
Warren Junior High School in Calgary. Chynna
was awarded this honour after being runner-up
in November. The school has 164 students in
Grade 7 and the judging criteria includes the
areas of supporting school spirit, positive peer
relationships, leadership, attitude, helpfulness,
and academic achievement. Chynna is the
only student in Grade 7 asked to work in the
school’s store and she has a regular shift in the
office where she answers the phones and fulfils
other receptionist duties. She ran on the cross
country team last fall and plays flute in the
junior band. She is also an original member of
the Homework Club. Well done Chynna! Keep
doing your best and remember we both love
you very much!

296648801,2015-11-26T15:12:05,"Healthcare and research environments have common characteristics and needs, such as managing people and resources, planning and conducting distributed activities, event-sensitive and monitoring processes. There are several examples in which Workflow Management Systems can aid healthcare management, systematizing, logging and automating activities. In this work we propose a context-driven approach to produce health workflows, which goes beyond an adaptation of workflows tasks to afford health procedures - as proposed in related work - departing from the rationale born from health professionals and materialized in CIG. This paper presents our proposal to support nursing processes through customization of workflows tools using as a starting point a comparative study of systems with respect to features required by healthcare professionals.7584 Inst.

490880318,2021-10-01T00:00:00,"In this paper, we present initial results from our distributed edge systems research in the domain of sustainable harvesting of common good resources in the Arctic Ocean. Specifically, we are developing a digital platform for real-time privacy-preserving sustainability management in the domain of commercial fishery surveillance operations. This is in response to potentially privacy-infringing mandates from some governments to combat overfishing and other sustainability challenges. Our approach is to deploy sensory devices and distributed artificial intelligence algorithms on mobile, offshore fishing vessels and at mainland central control centers. To facilitate this, we need a novel data plane supporting efficient, available, secure, tamper-proof, and compliant data management in this weakly connected offshore environment. We have built our first prototype of Dorvu, a novel distributed file system in this context. Our devised architecture, the design trade-offs among conflicting properties, and our initial experiences are further detailed in this paper",File System Support for Privacy-Preserving Analysis and Forensics in Low-Bandwidth Edge Environments,10.3390/info12100430,,"[{'title': 'Information', 'identifiers': ['issn:2078-2489', '2078-2489']}]",'MDPI AG',core

Manual annotation of data is labour‐intensive, and the cost and effort needed are an important obstacle to the development and deployment of automated analysis. In a previous work, we have shown that deep learning classifiers can successfully be trained on synthetic images and annotations. Here, we provide a curated set of fish image data and backgrounds, the necessary software tools to generate synthetic images and annotations, and annotated real datasets to test classifier performance. The dataset is constructed from images collected using the Deep Vision system during two surveys from 2017 and 2018 that targeted economically important pelagic species in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. We annotated a total of 1,879 images, randomly selected across trawl stations from both surveys, comprising 482 images of blue whiting, 456 images of Atlantic herring, 341 images of Atlantic mackerel, 335 images of mesopelagic fishes and 265 images containing a mixture of the four categories",A real‐world dataset and data simulation algorithm for automated fish species identification,10.1002/gdj3.114,,"[{'title': 'Geoscience Data Journal', 'identifiers': ['issn:2049-6060', '2049-6060']}]",'Wiley',core
395143868,2021-02-01T00:00:00,"[EN] Wetlands play a key role in preserving biodiversity and preventing climate change. Their conservation poses an important and pressing challenge. In the Mediterranean region, one of the key threats to wetland survival is the lack of water due to competition for resources. The selection of the most sustainable water resources for wetland conservation is a complex elicitation problem. A novel Water Resources Sustainability Model (WRSM) focused on water quality has been developed to support the decision-making. This collaborative elicitation model is based on the analytical hierarchy process and uses the reference environmental status of the wetland. The model can be used to discriminate which water resources are more sustainable for the conservation of the wetland. The WRSM has been applied successfully to Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park. The framework enables establishing priorities when analyzing in terms of water quality any surface, recycled or underground water resources.Canto-Perello, J.; Benitez-Navio, A.; Martín Utrillas, MG.; Martinez-Leon, J.; Curiel Esparza, J.

REMEMBER WHEN ....
Close your eyes... A nd go back in time Before semi automatics and crack... Before SEGA dr Super Nintendo... Way back...I'm talking about Hide and seek at dusk. Red light, green light.
The corner Store.
Hopscotch, butterscotch, doubledutch, jacks, kickball, dodgeball.
Mother May I... Red Rover arid Roly Poly. ...... Hula Hoops.
Running through the sprinkler.
An ice cream coneion a warm summer night... Chocolate or vanilla or strawberry or maybe butter pecan.
• Wait...
Watching Saturday Morning cartoons... Short commercials.
Fat Albert, Road Runner, The Three Stooges, and Bugs.
Or back f urther...
i When around the comer seemed far away, And going downtown seemed like going somewhere.
Cops and Robbers, Cowboys and Indians, Zorro. Climbing trees, building igloos out of snow banks
. Running till you were out of breath. Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt. ..
Jumping on the bed. , ""a Pillow fights.
Spinning around, getting dizzy, and falling
down...
Being tired from playing...Remember that?
The worst embarrassment was being picked last for a team.
War was a card game.
Water balloonsweretheultimate weapon; < Baseball cards in the spokes transformed any bike
into a motorcycle. :
I'm not finished just yet...
When you'd reach into a muddy gutter for a
! penny.
When you got your windshield cleaned, oil checked,
and gas pumped without asking, for free, every ; time...
and, you didn't pay for air.
if When nearly everyone's mom was at home . when the kids got there.
When it took five minutes for the TV to warm up.
if you even had one.
It was magic when dad would ""remove* his thumb.
When it was considered a great privilege to be taken out to dinner at a real restaurant with your parents.
When girls neither dated nor kissed until late high school, if then. When they threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed...and did!
When being sent to the principal's office was nothing compared to the fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home. Basically, we were in fear for our lives but it wasn't because of drive-by shootings, drugs, gangs, etc.
Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat!
Didn't that feel good? Just to go back and say,
""Yeah, I remember that!"" Remember when... Decisions were made by going ""eeny-meeny- miney-mo.""
Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, ""Do over!""
""Race issue"" meant arguing about who ran the fastest.
. The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was cooties.
It was unbelievable that dodgeball wasn't an . Olympic event.
Having a weapon in school meant being caught with a slingshot.
Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better.
Taking drugs meant orange-flavored chewable aspirin.
Abilities were discovered because of a ""double­dog-dare.""
If you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!6

Michael D. Friedman is Managing Director at Ocean Tomo, overseeing its Investments practice, which is composed of Investment Banking, Asset Management and Investment Research.
Ocean Tomo’s Investment Banking practice brings IP financing, monetization and capital markets solutions to corporations and other intellectual property owners. Recent notable transactions include the leveraged buyout of Mosaid Technologies and the sale of MIPS Technologies’ IP portfolio. Ocean Tomo Asset Management, where Mr. Friedman serves as Chief Investment Officer, engages in public equity, special situations and private equity investing where intellectual property insight drives alpha creation. Investment Research works in parallel with institutional investors, hedge funds and private equity funds advising them on capital allocations to IP-themed investments.
Mr. Friedman holds a JD from the University of Chicago Law School, where he worked as Research Editor of the University of Chicago Legal Forum. He also holds a BS in marine engineering and nautical science from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Mr. Friedman is a member of the board of directors of the Intellectual Property Exchange International, the world’s first IP-focused financial exchange, and a Lecturer in Law at the University of Chicago Law School.
Jay P. Kesan is a Professor at the University of Illinois, College of Lawwhere he is H. Ross & Helen Workman Research Scholar and Director of the Program in Intellectual Property and Technology Law. Professor Kesan received his J.D. summa cum laude from Georgetown University, where he received several awards including Order of the Coif and served as associate editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. After graduation, he clerked for Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Prior to attending law school, Jay Kesan – who also holds a Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin – worked as a research scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. He is a registered patent attorney and practiced at the former firm of Pennie & Edmonds LLP in the areas of patent litigation and patent prosecution. In addition, he has published numerous scientific papers, and he has obtained several patents in the U.S. and abroad. His recent publications can be found on SSRN (Social Science Research Network) at http://www.ssrn.com. At the University of Illinois, Professor Kesan is appointed in the College of Law, the Institute of Genomic Biology, the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the College of Business, and the Department of Agricultural & Consumer Economics. Professor Kesan continues to be professionally active in the areas of patent litigation and technology entrepreneurship. He has served as a special master in patent litigations, and has served as a technical and legal expert and/or counsel in patent matters. He also serves on the boards of directors/advisors of start-up technology companies.
Matthew Levy is Patent Counsel at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, where he handles legal, policy advocacy, and regulatory matters related to patents and is lead blogger for CCIA’s Patent Progress.
Matt joined the CCIA in 2013 from the IP boutique Cloudigy Law, PLLC. He has also been an associate at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett, & Dunner, LLP and at Hogan & Hartson LLP.

361641383,2021-01-01T00:00:00,"Satellite altimeters provide global observations of sea surface height (SSH) and present a unique dataset for advancing our theoretical understanding of upper ocean dynamics and monitoring its variability. Considering that mesoscale SSH patterns can evolve on timescales comparable to or shorter than satellite return periods, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct the continuous SSH evolution as currently available altimetry observations are still spatially and temporally sparse. Here we explore the possibility of SSH interpolation via Deep Learning by using synthetic observations from an idealized quasigeostrophic (QG) model of baroclinic ocean turbulence. We demonstrate that Convolutional Neural Networks with Residual Learning are superior in SSH reconstruction to linear and recently developed dynamical interpolation techniques. Also, the deep neural networks can provide a skillful state estimate of unobserved deep ocean currents at mesoscales. These conspicuous results suggest that SSH patterns of eddies might contain substantial information about the underlying deep ocean currents that are necessary for SSH prediction. Our training data is focused on highly idealized physics and diversification of processes needs to be considered to more accurately represent the real ocean. In addition, methodological improvements such as transfer learning and implementation of dynamically‐aware loss functions might be necessary to consider before its ultimate use with real satellite observations. Nonetheless, by providing a proof of concept based on synthetic data, our results point to deep learning as a viable alternative to existing interpolation and, more generally, state estimation methods for satellite observations of eddying currents.
Plain Language Summary
Satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) are widely used to derive surface ocean currents on a global scale. However, due to gaps in SSH observations, it remains challenging to retrieve the dynamics of rapidly evolving upper‐ocean currents. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Deep Learning framework that is based on pattern recognition extracted from SSH observations. Using synthetic data generated from a simplified model of ocean turbulence, we demonstrate that deep learning can accurately estimate both surface and sub‐surface ocean currents, significantly outperforming the most commonly used techniques. By providing a proof of concept, our study highlights the strong potential of deep learning for estimating ocean currents from satellite observations",A Deep Learning approach to spatiotemporal SSH interpolation and estimation of deep currents in geostrophic ocean turbulence,10.1029/2019MS001965,,,'American Geophysical Union (AGU)',core
335616705,2017-11-13T00:00:00,"[EN] Underwater sensors provide one of the possibilities to explore oceans, seas, rivers, fish farms and dams, which all together cover most of our planet's area. Simulators can be helpful to test and discover some possible strategies before implementing these in real underwater sensors. This speeds up the development of research theories so that these can be implemented later. In this context, the current work presents an agent-based simulator for defining and testing strategies for measuring the amount of fish by means of underwater sensors. The current approach is illustrated with the definition and assessment of two strategies for measuring fish. One of these two corresponds to a simple control mechanism, while the other is an experimental strategy and includes an implicit coordination mechanism. The experimental strategy showed a statistically significant improvement over the control one in the reduction of errors with a large Cohen's d effect size of 2.55.This work acknowledges the research project  Desarrollo Colaborativo de Soluciones AAL  with reference TIN2014-57028-R funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

The quality-controlled data set consists of 996,583 salinity observations collected between August 2012 and April 2014. A comparison of the drifter salinities with Aquarius satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) data shows that the lifespan of the salinity sensor fitted to the drifters is of the order of one year. The salinity and velocity data from the drifters were used to validate salt transport divergence computed with satellite products, with satellite salinity taken from the standard Aquarius v3.0 data set. The results indicate good agreement between the two independent methods, and also demonstrate that the effect of the eddy field combined with SSS variability at the surface dominates the signal. SSS variability within spatial bins as compared to Aquarius-beam footprints measured by drifters can be in excess of 0.1 psu. This result suggests that careful evaluation of the representation error is required when single-point in situ measurements, such as those collected by Argo floats, are used to validate spatially averaged Aquarius salinity data. © 2015 by The Oceanography Society.

Our approach is to deploy sensory devices and distributed artificial intelligence algorithms on mobile, offshore fishing vessels and at mainland central control centers. To facilitate this, we need a novel data plane supporting efficient, available, secure, tamper-proof, and compliant data management in this weakly connected offshore environment. We have built our first prototype of Dorvu, a novel distributed file system in this context. Our devised architecture, the design trade-offs among conflicting properties, and our initial experiences are further detailed in this paper",File System Support for Privacy-Preserving Analysis and Forensics in Low-Bandwidth Edge Environments,,,,'MDPI AG',core
480189028,2021-08-01T00:00:00,"Abstract Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers opportunities to collect data on the occurrence of vocal species for long periods of time, at multiple locations, and under a range of environmental conditions. Some species emit individually distinctive calls, including bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) that produce signature whistles. Our study used PAM to determine the seasonal occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and utilized individually specific signature whistles to (1) track individuals spatially and temporally, (2) assess site fidelity off Maryland (MD), USA, (3) estimate the minimum abundance of dolphins in the study area, and (4) develop a dynamic habitat‐based relative abundance model applicable as a real‐time dolphin relative abundance prediction tool. Acoustic recorders were deployed at two sites offshore of Ocean City, MD, and at one site in the upper Chesapeake Bay, MD. Acoustic recordings from 2016 to 2018 were analyzed for signature whistles, and re‐occurrences of individual whistles were identified using a combination of machine learning and manual verification. A habitat‐based density model was created using the number of signature whistles combined with environmental conditions. A total of 1518 unique signature whistles were identified offshore of Maryland and in the upper Chesapeake Bay. There were 184 re‐occurrences of 142 whistles, with a mean of 135 d between re‐occurrences (range = 1–681 d). These repeated detections of the same individuals occurred most frequently at the site near Ocean City, MD, indicating the highest site fidelity. Re‐occurrences were recorded among all three sites, indicating movement of dolphins between the Chesapeake Bay and off the Atlantic coast of Maryland. The weekly number of individual dolphins detected off the Atlantic coast was significantly related to two environmental variables: sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. This habitat model could be used to predict relative dolphin abundance offshore of Maryland and inform management within the region, including in relation to offshore wind energy development and other stakeholders",Identifying and predicting occurrence and abundance of a vocal animal species based on individually specific calls,10.1002/ecs2.3685,,"[{'title': 'Ecosphere', 'identifiers': ['issn:2150-8925', '2150-8925']}]",'Wiley',core
202016805,2014-12-31,"AbstractIn this paper, an implementation study was undertaken to employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in third-generation ocean wave models for direct mapping of wind-wave spectra into exact nonlinear interactions. While the investigation expands on previously reported feasibility studies of Neural Network Interaction Approximations (NNIA), it focuses on a new robust neural network that is implemented in Wavewatch III (WW3) model. Several idealistic and real test scenarios were carried out. The obtained results confirm the feasibility of NNIA in terms of speeding-up model calculations and is fully capable of providing operationally acceptable model integrations. The ANN is able to emulate the exact nonlinear interaction for single-and multi-modal wave spectra with a much higher accuracy then Discrete Interaction Approximation (DIA). NNIA performs at least twice as fast as DIA and at least two hundred times faster than exact method (Web-Resio-Tracy, WRT) for a well trained dataset. The accuracy of NNIA is network configuration dependent. For most optimal network configurations, the NNIA results and scatter statistics show good agreement with exact results by means of growth curves and integral parameters. Practical possibilities for further improvements in achieving fast and highly accurate emulations using ANN for emulating time consuming exact nonlinear interactions are also suggested and discussed",Integration of Artificial Neural Networks into Operational Ocean Wave Prediction Models for Fast and Accurate Emulation of Exact Nonlinear Interactions ,10.1016/j.procs.2014.05.104,,,The Authors.

In such an environment, operating multiple vehicles to observe dynamic oceanographic phenomena, such as ocean processes and marine life, from fronts to cetaceans, has required that we design, implement and operate software, methods and processes which can support opportunistic needs in real-world settings with substantial constraints. In this work, an approach for coordinated measurements using such platforms, which relate directly to task outcomes, is presented. We show the use and operational value of a new Artificial Intelligence based mixed-initiative system for handling multiple platforms along with the networked infrastructure support needed to conduct such operations in the open sea.

90251668,2016-09-01T00:00:00Z,"For decades, PID (Proportional + Integral + Derivative)-like controllers have been successfully used in academia and industry for many kinds of plants. This is thanks to its simplicity and suitable performance in linear or linearized plants, and under certain conditions, in nonlinear ones. A number of PID controller gains tuning approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decades; most of them off-line techniques. However, in those cases wherein plants are subject to continuous parametric changes or external disturbances, online gains tuning is a desirable choice. This is the case of modular underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) where parameters (weight, buoyancy, added mass, among others) change according to the tool it is fitted with. In practice, some amount of time is dedicated to tune the PID gains of a ROV. Once the best set of gains has been achieved the ROV is ready to work. However, when the vehicle changes its tool or it is subject to ocean currents, its performance deteriorates since the fixed set of gains is no longer valid for the new conditions. Thus, an online PID gains tuning algorithm should be implemented to overcome this problem. In this paper, an auto-tune PID-like controller based on Neural Networks (NN) is proposed. The NN plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of PID gains that achieves stability of the system. The NN adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. Simulation results are given considering an underactuated 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) underwater ROV. Real time experiments on an underactuated mini ROV are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme",Neural Network-Based Self-Tuning PID Control for Underwater Vehicles,10.3390/s16091429,,"[{'title': None, 'identifiers': ['issn:1424-8220', '1424-8220']}]",MDPI AG,core

People always come to cities because they want to be part of something, this magnet in the cities created the problem of population (Ericsson: Thinking Cities in the Networked Society, 2012). Approximately 50% of world’s population lives in urban areas, a number which is expected to increase to nearly 60% by 2030. (Mutizwa-Mangiza ND, Arimah B C, Jensen I, Yemeru EA, Kinyanjui MK, 2011). 



According to the rapid change in cities’ population there exists a need to utilize intelligent prediction tools to deliver a better way of living. Smart cities provide an opportunity to connect people and places using innovative technologies that help in better city planning and management ( Khan, Anjum, Soomro, & Tahir, 2015).



Data is never a new thing, but data sources are always in change. The internet made everything easier and more reachable. This wide range of technologies such as IOT (internet of things) and M2M (machine to machine) (Gartner, 2015), is believed to offer a new potential to deliver an analytical framework for urban optimization. The real value of such data is gained by new knowledge acquired by performing data analytics using various data mining, machine learning or statistical methods. 



According to this technologically mutated, data comes from weather channels, street security cameras, Facebook, Twitter, sensor networks, in-car devices, location-based smartphone apps, RFID tags, smart meters, among other sources (Hinssen, 2012). This massive amount of information that comes from real-time based tools, made the world in front of a new era of data called ‘Big Data’. However, turning an ocean of messy data into knowledge and wisdom is an extremely challenging task.



The proposed paper will discuss the IOT developed frameworks which are used to improve cities infrastructure and their vital systems. Analyzing these frameworks will help developing a conceptual proposal of data visualizing software; with the aim of helping urban planners get a better and easier way to comprehend the usage of multi-data sources for city planning and management.



The full control of data is an open challenge, however proposing the fundamental bases of framework with the ability to extend and having an application layer above would be very helpful for urban process shifting.

305109079,2014-04-23T00:00:00,"Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.



The large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.



Here we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.



We have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.



Two advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.



Finally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations,10.5194/npg-21-521-2014,https://core.ac.uk/download/305109079.pdf,,'Copernicus GmbH',core
479490182,2021-11-02T00:00:00,"Critical evaluation and understanding of ship responses in the ocean is
important for not only the design and engineering of future platforms but also
the operation and safety of those that are currently deployed. Simulations or
experiments are typically performed in nominal sea conditions during ship
design or prior to deployment and the results may not be reflective of the
instantaneous state of the vessel and the ocean environment while deployed.
Short-term temporal predictions of ship responses given the current wave
environment and ship state would enable enhanced decision-making onboard for
both manned and unmanned vessels. However, the current state-of-the-art in
numerical hydrodynamic simulation tools are too computationally expensive to be
employed for real-time ship motion forecasting and the computationally
efficient tools are too low fidelity to provide accurate responses. A
methodology is developed with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to

Case studies are performed for both course-keeping and turning circle
scenarios. An estimate of the vessel's encounter frame is made with the
trajectories observed in the training dataset. Wave elevation time histories
are given by artificial wave probes that travel with the estimated encounter
frame and serve as input into the neural network, while the output is the 6-DOF
temporal ship motion response. Overall, the neural network is able to predict
the temporal response of the ship due to unseen waves accurately, which makes
this methodology suitable for system identification and real-time ship motion

199272635,2011-01-01T00:00:00,"Operational activities in the ocean like planning for structural repairs or fishing expeditions require real time prediction of waves over typical time duration of say a few hours. Such predictions can be made by using a numerical model or a time series model employing continuously recorded waves. This paper presents another option to do so and it is based on a different time series approach in which the input is in the form of preceding wind speed and wind direction observations. This would be useful for those stations where the costly wave buoys are not deployed and instead only meteorological buoys measuring wind are moored. The technique employs alternative artificial intelligence approaches of an artificial neural network (ANN), genetic programming (GP) and model tree (MT) to carry out the time series modeling of wind to obtain waves. Wind observations at four offshore sites along the east coast of India were used. For calibration purpose the wave data was generated using a numerical model. The predicted waves obtained using the proposed time series models when compared with the numerically generated waves showed good resemblance in terms of the selected error criteria. Large differences across the chosen techniques of ANN, GP, MT were not noticed. Wave hindcasting at the same time step and the predictions over shorter lead times were better than the predictions over longer lead times.

346612996,2020-11-03T08:00:00,"In recent years, large scale deployments of electrical energy generation using renewable sources (RES) such as wind, solar and ocean wave power, along with more sustainable means of transformation have emerged in response to different initiatives oriented toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Strategies facilitating the integration of renewable generation into the grid and electric propulsion in transportation systems are proposed in this work.
Chapter 2 investigates the grid-connected operation of a wave energy converter (WEC) along with a hybrid supercapacitor/undersea energy storage system (HESS). A combined sizing and energy management strategy (EMS) based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. Comparisons in terms of power and energy capacity between the HESS sized with the proposed approach, and SC-only and UESS-only cases are performed. To facilitate fair comparisons a similar WEC output power profile is employed, and it is assumed that the storage components, as hybrid or individually, counteract the power variations. The adaptability of the RL-based EMS is verified using different power profiles in the learning and testing phases. Real-time simulation results corroborate that the capacity of the HESS components is notably reduced when EMS is considered in the sizing stage. Furthermore, RL-based EMS is able to regulate WEC output power, even in presence of serious imbalances between harvested and dispatched wave energy.
In the marine sector, new shipboard power system architectures are been proposed in response to the increasing use of electric propulsion, e.g. medium-voltage dc (MVDC) topologies. Due to interactions of the ship and the propeller with sea waves, large thrust/torque variations are translated into steep power fluctuations on the MVDC bus of the ship, affecting the stability and quality of the onboard power grid. A method to joint sizing/EMS a HESS comprising battery and supercapacitor to mitigate power fluctuations on the medium-voltage dc bus associated to propulsion system thrust/torque variations is studied in chapter 3. A deep reinforcement learning framework is employed for the joint sizing/EMS problem. The proposed strategy avoids the requirement for knowledge of the ship propulsion power profile, and it features adaptability to varying sea states and feasibility of real-time implementation. A comparative analysis between the HESS designed with the proposed methodology and the cases where battery-only, and SC-only, mitigate power fluctuations caused by propulsion system variations demonstrates the efficacy of the joint sizing/EMS on reducing the size of the energy storage system. Furthermore, real-time implementation feasibility and adaptability to different ship propulsion power profiles is validated through real-time simulations.
In chapter 4, a control method for grid-side power electronic converters in grid-connected renewable energy generators (REG) is presented. The scheme, known as hybrid data-model predictive direct power control (HD-MPDPC), employs long-prediction horizons to provide more reliable REG output power dispatch. Computational load of classical MPDPC is mitigated by reducing the number of candidate voltage vectors to be examined in the cost function. Candidate voltage vector reduction is accomplished by using data-driven forecast of REG output power and the principle of direct power control (DPC). REG power is forecasted using recurrent neural networks. In DPC, active and reactive power hysteresis controllers along with the sector in which grid voltage vector lies are used to determine the switching states of the grid-side power electronic converter. Thanks to reduced computational burden offered by the hybrid structure, the proposed strategy is able to dispatch REG power more reliably over long horizons. This in turn enables REG as a regulating reserves service provider in power systems. Real-time simulation studies of a grid-connected wave energy conversion system demonstrate the reduced computational toll of HD-MPDPC and its effectiveness in regulating REG output power over long horizons",Intelligent Data-Driven Energy Flow Controllers for Renewable Energy and Electrified Transportation Systems,,,,LSU Digital Commons,core
